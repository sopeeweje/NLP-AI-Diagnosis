"Multi-modal Health Information Technology Innovations for Precision Management of Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glaucoma is the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness and will affect >110 million people by 2040. Early detection and treatment are critical, as symptoms typically do not present until the disease is advanced. A data-driven precision medicine approach is needed to better identify individuals who are at greatest risk of developing the disease and who are at greatest risk of progressing quickly to vision loss. While there has been considerable progress in eye imaging and testing to improve glaucoma monitoring, precision management of glaucoma is incomplete without accounting for patients' co-existing systemic conditions, concurrent systemic medications and treatments, and adherence with prescribed glaucoma treatment. Understanding how systemic conditions, and specifically vascular conditions such as hypertension, impact glaucoma presents growing public health importance given the increasing co-morbidities facing aging populations. Preliminary studies have demonstrated the predictive value of systemic data, even without ophthalmic endpoints. Similarly, measuring medication adherence is important for guiding patient counseling and engagement and avoiding downstream interventions such as surgeries, which carry high cost and morbidity. These factors are important for providing a more comprehensive perspective of glaucoma management and for improving patient outcomes, yet they are relatively understudied. I propose applying multi-modal advancements in health information technology (IT) to address these gaps and achieve the following specific aims: (1) Develop machine learning-based predictive models classifying patients at risk for glaucoma progression using systemic electronic health record (EHR) data from a diverse nationwide patient cohort; (2) evaluate how integrating blood pressure (BP) data from novel smartwatch-based home BP monitors enhance predictive models for risk stratification in glaucoma, and (3) measure glaucoma medication adherence using innovative flexible electronic sensors to validate their use for future interventions aimed at improving adherence and clinical outcomes in glaucoma. These studies would leverage state- of-the-art methods in big-data predictive modeling as well as cutting-edge advancements in sensor technologies. This multi-faceted approach will build a foundation for a health IT framework geared toward improving risk stratification and generating novel therapeutic targets for glaucoma patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE A precision medicine approach is critical for early detection and treatment of glaucoma, an insidious chronic eye disease that can lead to blindness and severely decreased quality of life. The relationship between systemic conditions and treatments with glaucoma progression, as well as methods for monitoring and promoting glaucoma medication adherence, represent areas of glaucoma management that are not well-understood and are thus critical opportunities for technology-driven interventions. This study proposes the development and application of multi- modal health information technology innovations – such as machine learning-based predictive modeling, massive electronic datasets, wearable devices, and flexible sensor electronics – to enhance understanding of glaucoma pathophysiology and identify new potential therapeutic strategies.",Multi-modal Health Information Technology Innovations for Precision Management of Glaucoma,10018290,DP5OD029610,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Aging', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Blindness', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Eyedrops', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Home Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Home environment', 'Human Resources', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Nerve', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Track and Field', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'blood pressure regulation', 'circadian regulation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data integration', 'early onset', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'faculty community', 'flexibility', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient engagement', 'personalized management', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'racial minority', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smart watch', 'treatment adherence', 'wearable device']",OD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",DP5,2020,1,524978793,0.22795545776289386
"Deep Learning Approaches to Detect Glaucoma and Predict Progression from Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography Project Abstract / Summary Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of blindness in the United States and worldwide. It is estimated that over 2.2 million Americans suffer from POAG and that over 130,000 are legally blind from the disease. As the population ages, the number of people with POAG in the United States will increase to over 3.3 million in 2020 and worldwide to an estimated 111.8 million by 2040. POAG is a progressive disease associated with characteristic functional and structural changes that clinicians use to diagnose and monitor the disease. Over the past several years, spectral domain optical coherent tomography (SDOCT) has become the standard tool for measuring structure in POAG. This 3D imaging modality provides a wealth of information about retinal structure and POAG-related retinal layers. This large amount of data is hard for clinicians to interpret and use effectively to help guide treatment decisions. Instead, summary metrics such as average layer thicknesses are used to reduce SDOCT images to a handful of values. While these metrics are useful, they can be difficult to interpret and they throwaway important information regarding voxel intensity and texture, relationships across retinal layers, and the overall 3D structure of the retina. Relying too heavily on these metrics limits our ability to gain a deeper understanding structural contributions to POAG, the relationship between structure and visual function, and how structural (and functional) changes progress in POAG. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning, however, offer new data-driven tools and techniques to interpret 3D SDOCT images and learn from the large SDOCT datasets being collected in clinics around the world. This proposal will apply state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to 3D SDOCT data in order to (1) develop more accurate POAG detection tools, (2) reveal structure-function relationships, and (3) predict structural and functional progression in POAG. This proposal also details a training plan to help the PI transition from a postdoctoral scholar to an independent researcher. The mentored phase of this award will be supervised by the primary mentor, Dr. Linda Zangwill, and a multidisciplinary mentoring team including Dr. Robert Weinreb (Ophthalmology), Dr. David Kriegman (Computer Science and Engineering), and Dr. Armin Schwartzman (Biostatistics). Performing the proposed research, formal coursework, and mentored career development will the provide the PI with highly sought- after skills and experience to help ensure a successful transition into independence. Project Narrative Three-dimensional imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography have become an essential tool in the clinical care of glaucoma and other eye diseases. These imaging techniques provide clinicians with huge amounts of structural information, but interpreting the data and using it effectively to improve outcomes remains challenging in clinical glaucoma management. This project will improve patient care by applying powerful deep learning techniques to provide clinicians with critical decision support information to more accurately detect glaucoma, reveal associations between structure and visual function, and predict glaucoma progression.",Deep Learning Approaches to Detect Glaucoma and Predict Progression from Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography,10055661,K99EY030942,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Cornea', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Frequencies', 'Glaucoma', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Probability', 'Progressive Disease', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'South Korea', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Visualization', 'Width', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'college', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'field study', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'large datasets', 'legally blind', 'macula', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'research clinical testing', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'sex', 'skills', 'standard measure', 'three dimensional structure', 'tomography', 'tool']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2020,117347,524978793,0.14609901966641411
"Relationship between Glaucoma and the Three-Dimensional Optic Nerve Head Related Structure Project Summary Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness globally, and is characterized by optic nerve damage that leads to the death of retinal ganglion cells with accompanying visual field (VF) loss. The optic nerve head (ONH) is the site of injury to the optic nerve fibers and plays a central role in glaucoma pathogenesis and diagnosis. Traditionally, glaucoma is diagnosed based on fundus inspection of the ONH, which provides information about the surface contour of the ONH. However, the optic nerve damage occurs in the deeper layers. With the development of optical coherence tomography (OCT) techniques for three-dimensional (3D) retinal imaging, parameters derived from the 3D ONH related structure (e.g., Bruch's membrane opening minimum rim width, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, disc tilt etc.) have been studied to better understand glaucoma pathogenesis, and are used to supplement clinical diagnosis. In addition, studies of the ONH biomechanics have also shown that the strain level at the ONH at any given intraocular pressure level depends on the 3D geometry of the ONH related structure. A high strain level is hypothesized to contribute to retinal ganglion cell injury. Previous research has suggested that the 3D ONH related structure is correlated to glaucoma pathogenesis and critically important to glaucoma diagnosis. However, to date, a systematic study using clinical data to determine the impact of the 3D ONH related structure on glaucoma has not been conducted.  We propose to study the relationship between the 3D ONH related structure and glaucoma with a diverse set of combined techniques including image processing, computational mechanics and machine learning. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Derive features from the 3D ONH related structure and study their implications on VF loss patterns (K99 Phase). (2) Investigate the impact of the strain field patterns at the ONH on glaucoma (K99 Phase). (3) Study the effect of the 3D ONH related features on OCT diagnostic parameters (R00 Phase). (4) Model central vision loss from the 3D ONH related structural features (R00 Phase). Collectively, these studies will provide new insights and perspectives into the structure-function relationships in glaucoma and establish ocular anatomy specific norms of retinal nerve fiber layer profiles, which will advance our current understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and improve glaucoma diagnosis. Our research is of high clinical relevance and can be potentially translated into clinical practice for better glaucoma diagnosis, monitoring and treatment.  Through the proposed research and training plans, the applicant will build a solid knowledge base in ophthalmology and further improve his expertise in mathematical modeling and data science. This project will provide critical training opportunities to further enhance the applicant's capabilities to become an independent computational vision scientist in ophthalmology.

"Deep learning to quantify glaucomatous damage on fundus photographs for teleophthalmology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Atalie Carina Thompson, MD, MPH is a current glaucoma fellow and Heed fellow with a long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinician-scientist and leader in the field of glaucoma and public health. She has a long-standing interest in addressing healthcare disparities in medicine, and in improving the diagnosis of glaucoma and other ophthalmic diseases through imaging technology. While obtaining a medical degree at Stanford, she received a fellowship to complete a master’s degree in public health with additional higher-level coursework in biostatistics and epidemiology. Her immediate goal in this proposal is to refine and validate a deep learning (DL) algorithm capable of quantifying neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs and then to apply it in a pilot teleophthalmology program. With a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award, she will acquire additional didactic training and mentored research experience in glaucoma imaging, machine learning, biostatistics, clinical research, and the responsible conduct of research. Environment: The mentorship and expertise of the advisory committee, the extensive resources at the Duke Eye Center and Departments of Biostatistics and Biomedical Engineering, and the significant institutional commitment will provide her with the support needed to transition successfully into an independent clinician-scientist. Research: This proposal will test the hypothesis that a DL algorithm trained with SDOCT detects glaucoma on optic disc photographs with greater accuracy than human graders. In Specific Aim 1, a DL algorithm that quantifies neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs will be refined. The main hypothesis is that the quantitative output provided by the DL algorithm will allow accurate discrimination of eyes at different stages of the disease according to standard automated perimetry, and will generate cut-offs suitable for use in a screening setting. In Specific Aim 2, the short-term repeatability and reproducibility of the DL algorithm in optic disc photographs acquired over a time period of several weeks will be determined. The hypothesis is that the test-retest variability of the predictions from the DL algorithm will be similar to the original measurements acquired by SDOCT. In Specific Aim 3, the DL algorithm will be applied to optic disc photographs obtained during a pilot screening teleophthalmology program in primary care clinics and assisted living facilities. The hypothesis is that the DL algorithm will be more accurate than human graders when a full ophthalmic examination is used as the gold standard. This work will constitute the basis of an R01 grant and will advance our understanding of the application of deep learning algorithms in glaucoma and teleophthalmology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. However, since the disease can be asymptomatic until later stages, many patients with glaucoma will not know they have glaucoma until they suffer substantial and irreversible visual field loss. This study seeks to refine and validate a deep learning algorithm for early diagnosis of glaucoma on optic disc photographs and subsequently test it in a pilot teleophthalmology program.",Deep learning to quantify glaucomatous damage on fundus photographs for teleophthalmology,9868507,K23EY030897,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Nature', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Perimetry', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Suspect Glaucomas', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual impairment', 'Width', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'career', 'carina', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'experience', 'eye center', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'learning network', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health intervention', 'responsible research conduct', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'screening', 'tool']",NEI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,195131,607172798,0.19682340755900601
"Disposable, medication-integrated tactile and motion sensor for glaucoma therapy compliance improvement ABSTRACT Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. The number of people with primary open angle glaucoma is expected to exceed 100 million by 2040. The first-line therapy for glaucoma treatment is patient-administered hypotensive medication delivered topically via an eye drop. However, studies have consistently shown that patients rarely adhere to dosing recommendations. According to the Wilmer Glaucoma Center of Excellence, nearly 50% of individuals discontinue eye drops within six months of their first prescription. Of those that persist beyond six months, only 37% continue the therapy after three years, and only 10% of those prescribed glaucoma drops are persistent (without gaps) over the first year. Failure to adhere to dosing recommendations dramatically limits the effectiveness of eye drops in lowering intraocular pressure and delaying or preventing the progression of glaucoma. This well-known problem has prompted the development of several technological solutions for tracking adherence. Retinal Care's proposed solution is fundamentally different. The proposed device is a simple and inexpensive combination of sensors designed to provide feedback to patients, providers, payers, and care coordinators regarding the way a patient interacts with their medication. Tactile and motion data is acquired through a custom force-sensitive resistor (FSR) and a standard three-axis accelerometer. Combined, these two data sources provide significant insight into drop adherence, application mechanics, and patient behavior. More importantly, this data can inform decisions on how and when to intervene with a patient to maximize the likelihood of continued long-term drop adherence and vision preservation. The primary innovations are in the single-use design (enabled by low-cost custom FSR fabrication and the unique combination of low-cost electrical components), the novel mining of motion and tactile information for patient adherence and behavioral data, and the integration with an existing care coordination framework. Retinal Care approaches health care more holistically than traditional companies; recognizing the behavioral and psychosocial factors that are a root cause of blindness from eye diseases like glaucoma. While Retinal Care employs cutting-edge technology such as deep learning and advanced medical devices, we work actively toward implementing technology in a way that translates directly to improved quality of life for our patients by managing the entire care path. The technology proposed here, while novel in design, is not intended primarily as a tracking tool, though it will accomplish that sub-goal with greater effectiveness and at less cost than any existing product. Instead, it is designed explicitly to reduce blindness by providing the crucial data needed to tailor our interaction and intervention strategies to the individual patient; to maximize patient engagement and adherence to glaucoma care through a combination of education, incentivization, tailored communications, and personal interaction with our trained care coordinators. The goal of this project is to demonstrate feasibility (cost and functionality) of the simple device that will enable Retinal Care to effectively reduce blindness and visual impairment from glaucoma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally and in the US, where it affects more than 3 million Americans and costs the US economy $2.86 billion every year in direct costs and productivity losses. Topical medication administered through eye drops is a common and effective first-line therapy for reducing intraocular pressure and controlling glaucoma, but patient adherence to dosing recommendations is a consistent and pervasive issue that contributes significantly to vision loss. Retinal Care Inc. intends to develop and deploy a suite of simple, disposable, bottle-integrated sensors that will continuously collect real-time adherence and behavioral data to inform the design of patient-specific intervention and incentivization strategies to improve adherence and reduce blindness from glaucoma.","Disposable, medication-integrated tactile and motion sensor for glaucoma therapy compliance improvement",10010396,R41EY031632,"['Accelerometer', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blindness', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coin', 'Communication', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Direct Costs', 'Dose', 'Drops', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Eyedrops', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Film', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Liquid substance', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nylons', 'Ophthalmology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Plant Roots', 'Polyurethanes', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Radio', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Retina', 'Tactile', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Topical application', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analog', 'base', 'care coordination', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'incentive strategies', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'iterative design', 'kinematics', 'motion sensor', 'novel', 'patient engagement', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'productivity loss', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'screening', 'sensor', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'usability', 'wearable device']",NEI,"RETINAL CARE, INC.",R41,2020,219896,219896,0.1626159207080268
"A hybrid artificial intelligence framework for glaucoma monitoring Glaucoma is a complex neurodegenerative disease that results in degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. With older people making up the fastest growing part of the US population, glaucoma will become even more prevalent in the US in the coming decades. Due to the complex interaction of multiple factors in glaucoma, better structural and functional predictors are needed for its progression. The main impediments are massive health record data and sophisticated computational models. Our overall goal is to leverage the power of big data and rapidly evolving machine learning approaches. The NEI's “Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K)” initiative and the American Academy of Ophthalmology Intelligent Research in Sight (IRIS) registry are all efforts to exploit the power of data and to better understand diseases and to provide improved prevention and treatment.  In this multi-PI proposal, we offer to assemble over 1 million optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual fields (VFs) from the glaucoma research network (GRN). We propose to develop a hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that synthesizes Gaussian mixture model expectation maximization (GEM) and archetypal machine learning approach to identify glaucoma progression and its monitoring using VFs and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements. We will make these tools openly available to the vision and ophthalmology research communities.  Our proposed studies could offer substantial improvements in the prognosis of glaucoma as well as potentially providing OCT and joint VF/OCT surrogate endpoints to be used in glaucoma clinical trials. Leveraging big data in eye care is challenging. This study uses big functional and structural glaucoma data and develops hybrid machine learning models to identify glaucoma progression and its monitoring.

"Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD), is a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for diagnosing PACD despite its limited ability to quantify disease severity, especially in patients with early angle closure. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a quantitative and objective imaging-based method for assessing the angle. However, there are limited methods for clinicians to apply AS-OCT to the care of angle closure patients. The primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of a quantitative anterior segment OCT-based approach to evaluating patients with PACD and develop classification models for PACD based on AS-OCT measurements; and 2) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the training and mentored research experience necessary to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these objectives will provide critical skills and experiences necessary to establish an independent research program focused on applying AS-OCT imaging to improve the clinical care of patients with PACD. The proposed K23 application will provide additional training in four vital areas: 1) epidemiology and mechanisms of chronic disease; 2) classification of disease and prediction of disease risk; 3) biostatistical methods for clinical research; 4) machine learning and automated data analysis. The proposed research will use population-based data collected as part of the NIH-funded Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) to compare AS-OCT and gonioscopic assessments of angle width and determine the strength of association between these assessments and known PACD risk factors. The relationship between the degree of angle closure, measured by AS-OCT, and intraocular pressure (IOP), a sequela of angle closure and strong risk factor for glaucoma, will be characterized with CHES data and validated with data obtained by using a novel pupil control system on PACD patients recruited from the USC Roski Eye Institute (USCREI). Classification models for PACD stage and severity based on AS-OCT data from CHES will be developed using machine learning algorithms and validated with prospective data from USCREI patients with PACD. The results of the proposed research will provide the foundation for a future longitudinal study examining the benefit of using anterior segment OCT-based assessments and classification models to evaluate PACD patients and deliver targeted treatment to patients with higher risk for PACG. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop quantitative imaging-based diagnostic and treatment protocols that guide the standardized care of PACD patients and decrease the incidence of PACG and its associated ocular morbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE The management of angle closure patients at risk for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD) and a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, poses a significant challenge for eye care providers.

"Objective Quantification of Neural Damage for Screening, Diagnosis and Monitoring of Glaucoma with Fundus Photographs PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy and the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. As the disease remains largely asymptomatic until late stages, there is a pressing need to develop affordable approaches for screening before visual impairment occurs. Although sophisticated imaging technologies such as Spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) can provide highly reproducible and accurate quantitative assessment of glaucomatous damage, their application in widespread screening or non-specialized settings is unfeasible, given the high cost and operator requirements. Fundus photography is a low-cost alternative that has been used successfully in teleophthalmology programs. However, subjective human grading of fundus photos for glaucoma is poorly reproducible and highly inaccurate, as gradings tend to largely over- or underestimate damage. We propose a new paradigm for assessing glaucomatous damage by training a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network to provide quantitative estimates of the amount of neural damage from fundus photographs. In our Machine-to-Machine (M2M) approach, we trained a DL network to analyze fundus photos and predict quantitative measurements of glaucomatous damage provided by SDOCT, such as retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and neuroretinal rim measurements. Our preliminary results showed that the M2M predictions have very high correlation and agreement with the original SDOCT observations. This provides an objective method to quantify neural damage in fundus photos without requiring human graders, which could potentially be used for screening, diagnoses and monitoring in teleophthalmology and non- specialized point-of-care settings. In this proposal, we aim at refining and validating the M2M model in suitable, large datasets from population-based studies, electronic medical records, and clinical trial data. Our central hypothesis is that the M2M approach will be more accurate than subjective human gradings in screening, diagnosing, predicting and detecting longitudinal damage over time. In Aim 1, we will investigate the performance of the M2M model to screen for glaucomatous damage using large datasets from 6 population-based studies: Blue Mountains Eye Study, Los Angeles Latino Eye Study, Tema Eye Survey, Beijing Eye Study, Central India Eye and Medical Study and the Ural Eye and Medical Study, which will provide data on over 25,000 subjects of diverse racial groups. In Aim 2, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model to predict future development of glaucoma in eyes of suspects using the data from the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS). In Aim 3, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model in detecting glaucomatous progression over time using data from the Duke Glaucoma Registry, a large database of longitudinal structure and function data in glaucoma with over 25,000 patients followed over time. If successful, this proposal will lead to a validated, inexpensive, and widely applicable tool for screening, early diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma, that could be applied under population-based settings and also at non-specialized point-of-care settings. Project Narrative Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible visual impairment in the world. This proposal will employ a novel artificial intelligence paradigm for quantifying neural damage on ocular fundus photographs for the purpose of screening, diagnosing and monitoring glaucoma damage. The approach will be validated on large datasets from population-based studies, electronic medical records and clinical trial data.","Objective Quantification of Neural Damage for Screening, Diagnosis and Monitoring of Glaucoma with Fundus Photographs",10047364,R21EY031898,"['Agreement', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blindness', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'India', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Latino', 'Los Angeles', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Ocular Hypertension', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population Study', 'Race', 'Reference Standards', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visual impairment', 'algorithm training', 'clinical care', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'flexibility', 'hypertension treatment', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'learning network', 'longitudinal database', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'point of care', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'screening', 'time use', 'tool']",NEI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,241500,607172798,0.16437371436146142
"GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT  Human locomotion through natural environments requires the coordination of all levels of the sensorimotor hierarchy, from the cortical areas involved in processing of visual information and high level planning to the subcortical and spinal structures involved in the regulation of the gait and posture. However, despite the complex neural bases of human locomotion, the output is highly regular and well organized around the basic physical dynamics and biomechanics that define the stability and energetic costs of moving a bipedal body through space. There is a rich and growing body of literature describing detailed knowledge each of the individual components of human locomotion, including neural mechanisms, muscular neuromechanics, and biomechanics. However, very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion through a complex and dynamic world. This lack of integrative research not only restricts the breadth of impact of research from these individual disciplines, but also limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, it is necessary to develop an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world. In service of this general goal, this proposal outlines research projects aimed at specific unanswered questions about locomotion over different terrains. This proposal comprises three specific research and training aims on the visual control of locomotion over rough terrain. Aim 1 focuses on the behavioral task itself, Aim 2 investigates the sensory stimulus experienced during real-world locomotion, and Aim 3 examines the motor integration of visually specified goals into the ongoing gait cycle. Aim 1 investigates effects of changing environmental uncertainty and task demands on gaze allocation strategies during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 2 analyzes and models the visual stimulus experienced during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 3 determines how visually specified target footholds and targets are integrated into the ongoing preferred steady-state gait. Together these aims will significantly advance our understanding of how humans use vision to control their movement through the natural world, which greatly increase our ability to develop clinical diagnosis and treatment for loss of locomotor function.

"Improved Glaucoma Monitoring Using Artificial-Intelligence Enabled Dashboard Detecting functional and structural loss due to glaucoma is critical to making treatment decisions with the goal of preserving vision and maintaining quality of life. However, most of the approaches for glaucoma assessment through visual fields (VFs) or optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements have several limitations that poses critical challenge to their clinical utility. Identifying glaucoma-induced changes from a sequence of VF or OCT data is challenging either if the patients is in the early stages of the disease with subtle manifested structural and functional signs or if the patients are in the later stages of the disease with significant VF variability and OCT flooring effect. A major limitation of the current glaucoma monitoring techniques is that they generate a binary outcome of whether the glaucoma is worsening or not while current high-throughput data (e.g., OCT) has more information than a binary outcome. Another major drawback of some of these approaches is that they rely on traditional paradigms for progression detection such as linear regression. However, rates of glaucomatous progression may be non-linear and rapid, particularly during the later stages of the disease. Another limitation is that ad-hoc rules are adopted to define glaucoma progression while objective criteria are required to define thresholds for progression. Finally, a major deficiency of most of these methods is that they lack advanced visualization and interpretation. We propose to address these limitations by developing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled visualization tools for effectively monitoring the functional and structural loss in patients with glaucoma. This approach provides qualitative and quantitative means to monitor 1) global visual functional and structural worsening, 2) extent of loss in hemifields, and 3) local patterns of functional and structural loss on advanced 2-D visualization tools. To achieve these objectives, we have assembled a team of interdisciplinary experts with access to large clinically annotated glaucoma data. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced interpretable machine learning applied to a complete profile of VFs in all test locations (e.g., 54 in 24-2 system) and OCT-derived measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (e.g., 768 A-scans around the optic disc and 7 global sectoral regions) can objectively and automatically learn and quantify the most important features, yielding a more specific and sensitive means for monitoring of glaucoma worsening than current subjectively-specified or statistically-identified approaches. We also hypothesize that machine learning can provide interpretable models with several layers of glaucoma knowledge that may provide a promising complement to current glaucoma assessment tests. Our proposed studies may offer substantial improvements in prognosis and management of glaucoma through effective use of analysis and visualization to improve glaucoma management and making more informed treatment options. Current glaucoma assessment is hampered by several limitations including lack of visualization and interpretation, providing binary rather than more-informed results, utilizing traditional approaches for data analysis, and adopting ad-hoc assessment criteria. Glaucoma is best managed and treated if both functional and structural data is utilized and mined using advanced computational tools to generate more-informative quantitative results. We propose developing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled visualization dashboards for qualitative and quantitative monitoring of global visual functional and structural worsening, extent of loss in hemifields, and local patterns of functional and structural loss on advanced interpretable 2-D and 3-D visualization maps.",Improved Glaucoma Monitoring Using Artificial-Intelligence Enabled Dashboard,10043768,R21EY031725,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Axon', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Systems', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Floor', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'dashboard', 'field study', 'glaucoma test', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidimensional data', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'preservation', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'structured data', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R21,2020,253379,46216755,0.24479302903373992
"Deep Learning Approaches for Personalized Modeling and Forecasting of Glaucomatous Changes Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at managing the optimal care for individual cases due to difficulties of accurately assessing the potential progression and its speed and magnitude. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large inter-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we propose novel agnostic data-driven deep learning approaches to detect glaucoma and accurately forecast its progression that are optimized to each individual case. We will use state- of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. Instead of relying on the conventional knowledge-based approaches (e.g. quantifying tissues known to be significantly associated with glaucoma such as retinal nerve fiber layer), the proposed cutting-edge agnostic deep learning approaches determine the features responsible for future structural and functional changes out of thousands of features autonomously by learning from the provided large longitudinal dataset. This program will advance the use of structural and functional information obtained in the clinics with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma. Furthermore, the developed methods have potentials to be applied to various clinical applications beyond glaucoma and ophthalmology.

"Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma This project will use a combination of structural and functional measurements to test the hypothesis that early- stage damage in human glaucoma occurs first in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina – especially its OFF sub-lamina – as suggested by murine glaucoma models. In the first Aim, we will use a novel visible-light optical coherence tomograph (VIS OCT) to study structural changes in the retina of glaucoma patients. The newly developed VIS OCT has sufficient image contrast and resolution to segment the IPL boundaries and to define sub-lamination in volumetric OCT data, something not currently possible with existing near-infrared OCT instruments. We will make comparative measurements within the IPL and between the IPL, the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Because data from mouse models of glaucoma suggests that early damage occurs preferentially within the OFF sub-lamina of the IPL, we will make separate VIS OCT measurements biased for the OFF- and ON-sublaminae of the IPL and use machine learning approaches to determine whether a similar damage process can be demonstrated in human. To test whether OFF-pathway function is preferentially lost in glaucoma, we will use a novel Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) paradigm that employs sawtooth increments and decrements to bias the measurement to ON vs OFF pathways, respectively, a paradigm our data suggests discriminates glaucoma from control patients. The second Aim will optimize this SSVEP measurement for testing localized areas of the visual field. The third Aim will make comparative measurements of visual-field, VIS OCT and SSVEP loss patterns in a large sample of glaucoma patients and in age- and sex-matched controls. Thickness and interface reflectivity amplitude maps derived from VIS OCT imaging of the RNFL, GCL and IPL including sublaminae will be correlated topographically with visual field defects to assess the relative sensitivity of our structural biomarkers at and near visual field locations with demonstrable losses on conventional (Humphrey) perimetry. Similarly, SSVEP responses from different locations in the visual field will be correlated topographically with visual field loss patterns and to VIS OCT losses, with special emphasis on correlating structural damage in OFF vs ON sub-laminae of the IPL with the functional correlates derived from regional decremental and incremental SSVEPs. Separately and in combination, our structural and functional measurements are designed to provide strong tests of the biological hypothesis that the OFF pathway is preferentially damaged in human glaucoma, and to reveal new biomarkers for the disease. Improving visual outcomes in glaucoma will require a better understanding of the earliest sites and processes of damage and methods to measure them quickly and accurately in patients. This project will address both needs through a combination of novel Optical Coherence Tomography and electrophysiological measurements. The new imaging and electrophysiological tests that will be developed here, either separately or together, could eventually replace conventional visual field testing which is time-consuming and unreliable.",Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma,9913546,R01EY030361,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Noise', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perimetry', 'Process', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Rodent Model', 'Sampling', 'Scotoma', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual evoked cortical potential', 'base', 'cell injury', 'comparative', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'field study', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'sex']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,521102,560644462,0.25152115533656727
"Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of chronic optic neuropathy and a major source of ocular morbidity worldwide. Understanding preclinical events, early phase disease and disease heterogeneity represent key objectives in early disease detection, prevention and treatment of POAG. In this study, we propose 4 specific aims. 1) We will perform both targeted and untargeted metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for POAG using pre-clinical serum from a large case-control group (500 cases and 500 controls) nested within ongoing prospective studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical events that precede POAG diagnosis (blood was collected ~ 10 years prior to disease diagnosis). Prior studies suggest that nitric oxide metabolites represent genetically informed markers and will form the basis for targeted profiling. 2) While considerable discoveries have been made of POAG genes, more work is needed to leverage genome-wide information to inform POAG etiology. Thus, we will create a genome-wide genetic correlation matrix between POAG and complex traits previously linked to POAG, using data from the NEIGHBORHOOD (National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database; 3800 POAG cases) consortium and publicly available summary genome-wide association study data. An assessment of the shared heritability between POAG and these traits as well as the relation between the genetic risk scores for these traits and POAG will lead to new etiologic insights. 3) New-onset POAG is clinically heterogeneous with variable visual field (VF) loss patterns that may reflect different etiologies. We will apply archetype analysis, which objectively quantifies a patient's VF loss pattern to 16 existing clinically validated archetypes (ATs), 9 of which are glaucomatous in nature. Each POAG case (n=1250 from NHS, NHS2 and HPFS) and10 matched controls will be assigned 16 weighted coefficients that add up to 1, with each value representing how consistent his / her VF loss pattern is with each glaucomatous AT. We will evaluate the differential relation between established POAG risk factors and the values on the 16 ATs, to identify unique risk factors for homogeneous incident POAG subtypes. 4) A carbohydrate-restricted diet may meet the energy requirement in the non-myelinated retinal ganglion cell axon segment of the optic nerve and reduce risk of POAG. We will conduct a prospective evaluation of this exposure in relation to POAG and POAG subtypes in the 3 cohorts (n=2100 cases). By integrating MWAS, genomics with prospective environmental exposure data and AT analysis, this proposal addresses a number of important knowledge gaps—in particular, it will shed light on how genetic and pre-diagnostic risk factors influence POAG and POAG heterogeneity. Linking specific exposures with POAG subtypes will provide important mechanistic understanding as well as evidence of causality, which will contribute to discovering precision medicine approaches for this condition. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure-related chronic optic nerve disease that produces characteristic visual loss patterns. In this proposal we will study a host of genes, plasma metabolites and environmental factors in relation to POAG overall as well as it's objectively determined subtypes based on visual loss pattern. Understanding how these various exposures relate to POAG and it's subtypes will highlight disease prevention strategies and precision medical treatment options for this potentially blinding disease that requires lifetime management.",Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma,9933925,R01EY015473,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Archives', 'Arginine', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biogenesis', 'Blindness', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Carbohydrates', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Citrulline', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Health Professional', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Pathway', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Optic Nerve', 'Ornithine', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Plasma', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'case control', 'cohort', 'common treatment', 'dietary restriction', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'targeted treatment', 'time interval', 'trait']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,546195,415711940,0.08714894451574623
"Visible-light OCT angiography, velocimetry, and oximetry for characterizing retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma Project Summary Glaucoma damage to the optic nerve and impairment of vision are progressive and irreversible. Understanding mechanisms of glaucomatous injury will help to develop new approaches for treatments that can be used along with traditional therapies that lower intraocular pressure (IOP). Recent developments in optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography have brought increased attention to the role of the inner retinal circulation in glaucoma. To improve our understanding of retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma, we can take advantage of recent developments in visible-light OCT (vis-OCT) to characterize simultaneously tissue structure, vessel density, blood flow and oxygenation. The goal of this project is to further advance vis-OCT by attaining capillary-level measurements, test the value of measuring their local alterations as early indicators of glaucoma and glaucomatous progression and use this to evaluate impaired retinal autoregulation from retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss as a potential cause of increased susceptibility in advanced glaucoma. In Specific Aim 1 we will develop high-speed, high-sensitivity, high-resolution vis-OCT. The speed will be double that of the current system. A more stable supercontinuum laser will be used to improve system sensitivity, and a tighter focus will be used to improve lateral resolution. This will enable complete detection of capillaries that may be vulnerable to vascular dysfunction. Specific Aim 2 will develop quantitative OCT angiography, velocimetry and oximetry in capillaries as well as arteries and veins. Building on the high-resolution, high-contrast scans acquired in Aim 1, we will use machine learning to segment capillary plexuses, and advanced image processing to extract capillary architecture. Aided by this capillary architecture, we will automatically measure blood flow and oxygenation in capillary segments and incorporate them into a real-time platform. Specific Aim 3 will use this system to demonstrate that acute loss of RGCs, produced by optic nerve transection, alters retinal capillary plexus density, oximetry and velocimetry over time and that these changes precede altered oximetry and flow in larger retinal vessels. We will also show that loss of RGCs impairs the autoregulatory response to acute IOP challenge. In Specific Aim 4, we will demonstrate that optic nerve injury in a model of controlled, elevated IOP produces early alterations in capillary velocimetry, oximetry and autoregulation, show that they are more persistent with advanced injury, and demonstrate the pathophysiologic consequences of these observations. Successful development of this new technology will improve methods of early glaucoma diagnosis and detection of progression. Better understanding of retinal vascular factors that lead to increased susceptibility in advanced glaucoma will lead to improved treatments for these highly vulnerable patients. Project Narrative This project will develop advanced technology to image retinal capillaries and measure capillary blood flow and oxygen content.

"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of glaucoma are important because the onset is insidious and the damage is irreversible. Advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used in the past 2 decades to improve the objective evaluation of glaucoma. OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing. Measuring the improvement in retinal circulation could be a quicker way to detect the benefit of glaucoma therapies that work through neuroprotection or regeneration, compared to monitoring VF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography is a high-resolution imaging technology that can non-invasively measure both the eye structures and small blood vessels that are damaged by glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can provide detailed measurement over wider areas inside the eye, detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, monitor disease progression, and provide more timely assessment of the effectiveness of therapy. A goal of this project is to determine if this objective imaging technology can provide information that is equivalent to or better than subjective visual field testing, which though time-consuming and poorly reliable, is the current gold standard for long-term monitoring and management of glaucoma.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,9952373,R01EY023285,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eyedrops', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal macula', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trabeculectomy', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'cell injury', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'fiber cell', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'glaucoma surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'macula', 'neural network', 'neuroprotection', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'retina circulation', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'vascular factor', 'visual performance']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,564228,304670088,0.28418652256145194
"Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1 Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at certain stages of the disease severity spectrum, specifically in the early stage and in advanced disease. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large between-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we build on our long-standing contribution to ocular imaging and propose novel and sensitive means to detect glaucoma and its progression that are optimized to the various stages of disease severity. We will use information gathered from visual fields (functional information) and a leading ocular imaging technology – optical coherence tomography (OCT; structural information) to map the capability of detecting changes across the entire disease severity spectrum to identify optimal parameters for each stage of the disease. Both commonly used parameters provided by the technologies and newly developed parameters with good diagnostic potential will be analyzed. We will use state-of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. We will also utilize a new imaging technology, the visible light OCT, to generate retinal images with outstanding resolution to extract information about the oxygen saturation of the tissue. This will provide in-vivo, real time, and noninvasive insight into tissue functionality. Taken together, this program will advance the use of structural and functional information with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1,10019553,R01EY013178,"['3-Dimensional', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Floor', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Pathology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Width', 'advanced disease', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'deep learning', 'density', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'instrument', 'invention', 'knowledge base', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning method', 'macula', 'mathematical methods', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'ocular imaging', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tissue oxygenation', 'tool']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,687519,329565273,0.18295358589223318
"Relationship between Glaucoma and the Three-Dimensional Optic Nerve Head Related Structure Project Summary Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness globally, and is characterized by optic nerve damage that leads to the death of retinal ganglion cells with accompanying visual field (VF) loss. The optic nerve head (ONH) is the site of injury to the optic nerve fibers and plays a central role in glaucoma pathogenesis and diagnosis. Traditionally, glaucoma is diagnosed based on fundus inspection of the ONH, which provides information about the surface contour of the ONH. However, the optic nerve damage occurs in the deeper layers. With the development of optical coherence tomography (OCT) techniques for three-dimensional (3D) retinal imaging, parameters derived from the 3D ONH related structure (e.g., Bruch's membrane opening minimum rim width, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, disc tilt etc.) have been studied to better understand glaucoma pathogenesis, and are used to supplement clinical diagnosis. In addition, studies of the ONH biomechanics have also shown that the strain level at the ONH at any given intraocular pressure level depends on the 3D geometry of the ONH related structure. A high strain level is hypothesized to contribute to retinal ganglion cell injury. Previous research has suggested that the 3D ONH related structure is correlated to glaucoma pathogenesis and critically important to glaucoma diagnosis. However, to date, a systematic study using clinical data to determine the impact of the 3D ONH related structure on glaucoma has not been conducted.  We propose to study the relationship between the 3D ONH related structure and glaucoma with a diverse set of combined techniques including image processing, computational mechanics and machine learning. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Derive features from the 3D ONH related structure and study their implications on VF loss patterns (K99 Phase). (2) Investigate the impact of the strain field patterns at the ONH on glaucoma (K99 Phase). (3) Study the effect of the 3D ONH related features on OCT diagnostic parameters (R00 Phase). (4) Model central vision loss from the 3D ONH related structural features (R00 Phase). Collectively, these studies will provide new insights and perspectives into the structure-function relationships in glaucoma and establish ocular anatomy specific norms of retinal nerve fiber layer profiles, which will advance our current understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and improve glaucoma diagnosis. Our research is of high clinical relevance and can be potentially translated into clinical practice for better glaucoma diagnosis, monitoring and treatment.  Through the proposed research and training plans, the applicant will build a solid knowledge base in ophthalmology and further improve his expertise in mathematical modeling and data science. This project will provide critical training opportunities to further enhance the applicant's capabilities to become an independent computational vision scientist in ophthalmology.

"Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD), is a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for diagnosing PACD despite its limited ability to quantify disease severity, especially in patients with early angle closure. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a quantitative and objective imaging-based method for assessing the angle. However, there are limited methods for clinicians to apply AS-OCT to the care of angle closure patients. The primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of a quantitative anterior segment OCT-based approach to evaluating patients with PACD and develop classification models for PACD based on AS-OCT measurements; and 2) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the training and mentored research experience necessary to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these objectives will provide critical skills and experiences necessary to establish an independent research program focused on applying AS-OCT imaging to improve the clinical care of patients with PACD. The proposed K23 application will provide additional training in four vital areas: 1) epidemiology and mechanisms of chronic disease; 2) classification of disease and prediction of disease risk; 3) biostatistical methods for clinical research; 4) machine learning and automated data analysis. The proposed research will use population-based data collected as part of the NIH-funded Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) to compare AS-OCT and gonioscopic assessments of angle width and determine the strength of association between these assessments and known PACD risk factors. The relationship between the degree of angle closure, measured by AS-OCT, and intraocular pressure (IOP), a sequela of angle closure and strong risk factor for glaucoma, will be characterized with CHES data and validated with data obtained by using a novel pupil control system on PACD patients recruited from the USC Roski Eye Institute (USCREI). Classification models for PACD stage and severity based on AS-OCT data from CHES will be developed using machine learning algorithms and validated with prospective data from USCREI patients with PACD. The results of the proposed research will provide the foundation for a future longitudinal study examining the benefit of using anterior segment OCT-based assessments and classification models to evaluate PACD patients and deliver targeted treatment to patients with higher risk for PACG. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop quantitative imaging-based diagnostic and treatment protocols that guide the standardized care of PACD patients and decrease the incidence of PACG and its associated ocular morbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE The management of angle closure patients at risk for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD) and a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, poses a significant challenge for eye care providers. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for evaluating angle closure patients despite its limited ability to quantify PACD severity and predict progression to PACG.

"GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT  Human locomotion through natural environments requires the coordination of all levels of the sensorimotor hierarchy, from the cortical areas involved in processing of visual information and high level planning to the subcortical and spinal structures involved in the regulation of the gait and posture. However, despite the complex neural bases of human locomotion, the output is highly regular and well organized around the basic physical dynamics and biomechanics that define the stability and energetic costs of moving a bipedal body through space. There is a rich and growing body of literature describing detailed knowledge each of the individual components of human locomotion, including neural mechanisms, muscular neuromechanics, and biomechanics. However, very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion through a complex and dynamic world. This lack of integrative research not only restricts the breadth of impact of research from these individual disciplines, but also limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, it is necessary to develop an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world. In service of this general goal, this proposal outlines research projects aimed at specific unanswered questions about locomotion over different terrains. This proposal comprises three specific research and training aims on the visual control of locomotion over rough terrain. Aim 1 focuses on the behavioral task itself, Aim 2 investigates the sensory stimulus experienced during real-world locomotion, and Aim 3 examines the motor integration of visually specified goals into the ongoing gait cycle. Aim 1 investigates effects of changing environmental uncertainty and task demands on gaze allocation strategies during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 2 analyzes and models the visual stimulus experienced during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 3 determines how visually specified target footholds and targets are integrated into the ongoing preferred steady-state gait. Together these aims will significantly advance our understanding of how humans use vision to control their movement through the natural world, which greatly increase our ability to develop clinical diagnosis and treatment for loss of locomotor function.

"A hybrid artificial intelligence framework for glaucoma monitoring Glaucoma is a complex neurodegenerative disease that results in degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. With older people making up the fastest growing part of the US population, glaucoma will become even more prevalent in the US in the coming decades. Due to the complex interaction of multiple factors in glaucoma, better structural and functional predictors are needed for its progression. The main impediments are massive health record data and sophisticated computational models. Our overall goal is to leverage the power of big data and rapidly evolving machine learning approaches. The NEI's “Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K)” initiative and the American Academy of Ophthalmology Intelligent Research in Sight (IRIS) registry are all efforts to exploit the power of data and to better understand diseases and to provide improved prevention and treatment.  In this multi-PI proposal, we offer to assemble over 1 million optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual fields (VFs) from the glaucoma research network (GRN). We propose to develop a hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that synthesizes Gaussian mixture model expectation maximization (GEM) and archetypal machine learning approach to identify glaucoma progression and its monitoring using VFs and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements. We will make these tools openly available to the vision and ophthalmology research communities.  Our proposed studies could offer substantial improvements in the prognosis of glaucoma as well as potentially providing OCT and joint VF/OCT surrogate endpoints to be used in glaucoma clinical trials. Leveraging big data in eye care is challenging. This study uses big functional and structural glaucoma data and develops hybrid machine learning models to identify glaucoma progression and its monitoring.

"Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of chronic optic neuropathy and a major source of ocular morbidity worldwide. Understanding preclinical events, early phase disease and disease heterogeneity represent key objectives in early disease detection, prevention and treatment of POAG. In this study, we propose 4 specific aims. 1) We will perform both targeted and untargeted metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for POAG using pre-clinical serum from a large case-control group (500 cases and 500 controls) nested within ongoing prospective studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical events that precede POAG diagnosis (blood was collected ~ 10 years prior to disease diagnosis). Prior studies suggest that nitric oxide metabolites represent genetically informed markers and will form the basis for targeted profiling. 2) While considerable discoveries have been made of POAG genes, more work is needed to leverage genome-wide information to inform POAG etiology. Thus, we will create a genome-wide genetic correlation matrix between POAG and complex traits previously linked to POAG, using data from the NEIGHBORHOOD (National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database; 3800 POAG cases) consortium and publicly available summary genome-wide association study data. An assessment of the shared heritability between POAG and these traits as well as the relation between the genetic risk scores for these traits and POAG will lead to new etiologic insights. 3) New-onset POAG is clinically heterogeneous with variable visual field (VF) loss patterns that may reflect different etiologies. We will apply archetype analysis, which objectively quantifies a patient's VF loss pattern to 16 existing clinically validated archetypes (ATs), 9 of which are glaucomatous in nature. Each POAG case (n=1250 from NHS, NHS2 and HPFS) and10 matched controls will be assigned 16 weighted coefficients that add up to 1, with each value representing how consistent his / her VF loss pattern is with each glaucomatous AT. We will evaluate the differential relation between established POAG risk factors and the values on the 16 ATs, to identify unique risk factors for homogeneous incident POAG subtypes. 4) A carbohydrate-restricted diet may meet the energy requirement in the non-myelinated retinal ganglion cell axon segment of the optic nerve and reduce risk of POAG. We will conduct a prospective evaluation of this exposure in relation to POAG and POAG subtypes in the 3 cohorts (n=2100 cases). By integrating MWAS, genomics with prospective environmental exposure data and AT analysis, this proposal addresses a number of important knowledge gaps—in particular, it will shed light on how genetic and pre-diagnostic risk factors influence POAG and POAG heterogeneity. Linking specific exposures with POAG subtypes will provide important mechanistic understanding as well as evidence of causality, which will contribute to discovering precision medicine approaches for this condition. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure-related chronic optic nerve disease that produces characteristic visual loss patterns. In this proposal we will study a host of genes, plasma metabolites and environmental factors in relation to POAG overall as well as it's objectively determined subtypes based on visual loss pattern. Understanding how these various exposures relate to POAG and it's subtypes will highlight disease prevention strategies and precision medical treatment options for this potentially blinding disease that requires lifetime management.",Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma,9788096,R01EY015473,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Archives', 'Arginine', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biogenesis', 'Blindness', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Carbohydrates', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Citrulline', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Health Professional', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Pathway', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Optic Nerve', 'Ornithine', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Plasma', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'case control', 'cohort', 'common treatment', 'dietary restriction', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'targeted treatment', 'time interval', 'trait']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,528837,415711940,0.08714894451574623
"Personalizing Glaucoma Diagnosis by Disease Specific Patterns and Individual Eye Anatomy Project Summary/Abstract Glaucoma is a disease of the optic nerve which is accompanied by visual ﬁeld (VF) loss. While accurate VF loss diagnosis and the detection of its progression over time is of high relevance to clinical practitioners as it indicates the initiation of or change in ocular therapy, there is no consensus on objective measures for this purpose, and VF measurements are known to be often unreliable. The main objective of this project is to develop clinically applicable measures to improve the diagnosis of glaucomatous VF loss and of its progression by two approaches: First, the identiﬁcation of representative loss patterns and their progression, achieved by large-scale, customized bioinformatical procedures applied to data from glaucoma patients from nine clinical centers and second, the inclusion of eye and patient speciﬁc personalized parameters. In total, 480,486 VFs, are available for this project. One major aim is to develop novel diagnostic indices based on computationally identiﬁed evolution patterns of VF loss, particularly (1) an index that denotes the probability of glaucomatous vision loss and (2) an index that assigns probabilities to a VF that follow-up measurements will be in a certain defect class. The indices will be statistically evaluated on separate VF samples and compared to existing approaches. Routinely available patient speciﬁc parameters which are candidates to impact glaucomatous vision loss are patient ethnicity, type of glaucoma, spherical equivalent (SE) of refractive error and the location of the blind spot relative to ﬁxation. The effect of these parameters on the vision loss patterns will be systematically studied. The impact of their inclusion in the novel diagnostic indices and their potential improvement on glaucoma diagnosis will be quantiﬁed on a separate data set. A further aim is the calculation of a spatial map speciﬁc to a measured VF that represents the preferred VF locations of future defects as well as their reliability as an aid to event-based progression diagnosis. A second major objective is the investigation of the relationship of VF loss and individual parameters related to retinal structure, based on retinal nerve ﬁber layer thickness (RNFLT) measurements around the optic disc. The inter-relationship of representative patterns of RNFLT and its decrease over time with trajectories of major retinal arteries, SE, and blind spot location is systematically studied, and the impact on patterns of VF loss is quantitatively analyzed with the goal to improve the interpretation of existing VF loss and to predict future glaucomatous vision loss. Main contributions of the project with relevance to clinical practice are publicly available open-source software implementations of new diagnostic indices and maps, enhanced by individual functional and structural parameters, and a detailed and personalized model for the relationship between retinal structure and glaucomatous vision loss. Project Narrative Glaucoma is an ocular disease accompanied by vision loss which may progress over time up to total blindness, but the assessment of glaucomatous vision loss is noisy, and it is often hard for clinical practitioners to decide whether changes over time reﬂect true changes of functional vision or are the result of normal measurement variations or artifacts. This project contributes directly and immediately to public health by exploring the impact of individual anatomical parameters on the spatial patterns of glaucomatous vision loss in order to improve the diagnosis of vision loss and of its progression. Main objective of the project is the development of new quantitative diagnostic indices, implemented as publicly available software.",Personalizing Glaucoma Diagnosis by Disease Specific Patterns and Individual Eye Anatomy,9802123,R01EY030575,"['Anatomy', 'Atrophic', 'Axon', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blindness', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Refractive Errors', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Defect', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Retinal blind spot', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'base', 'central retinal artery', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'disease diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'fovea centralis', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglect', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'optic nerve disorder', 'outcome forecast', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'sample fixation', 'sex']",NEI,SCHEPENS EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,534037,12024944,0.11010281943313983
"Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma This project will use a combination of structural and functional measurements to test the hypothesis that early- stage damage in human glaucoma occurs first in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina – especially its OFF sub-lamina – as suggested by murine glaucoma models. In the first Aim, we will use a novel visible-light optical coherence tomograph (VIS OCT) to study structural changes in the retina of glaucoma patients. The newly developed VIS OCT has sufficient image contrast and resolution to segment the IPL boundaries and to define sub-lamination in volumetric OCT data, something not currently possible with existing near-infrared OCT instruments. We will make comparative measurements within the IPL and between the IPL, the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Because data from mouse models of glaucoma suggests that early damage occurs preferentially within the OFF sub-lamina of the IPL, we will make separate VIS OCT measurements biased for the OFF- and ON-sublaminae of the IPL and use machine learning approaches to determine whether a similar damage process can be demonstrated in human. To test whether OFF-pathway function is preferentially lost in glaucoma, we will use a novel Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) paradigm that employs sawtooth increments and decrements to bias the measurement to ON vs OFF pathways, respectively, a paradigm our data suggests discriminates glaucoma from control patients. The second Aim will optimize this SSVEP measurement for testing localized areas of the visual field. The third Aim will make comparative measurements of visual-field, VIS OCT and SSVEP loss patterns in a large sample of glaucoma patients and in age- and sex-matched controls. Thickness and interface reflectivity amplitude maps derived from VIS OCT imaging of the RNFL, GCL and IPL including sublaminae will be correlated topographically with visual field defects to assess the relative sensitivity of our structural biomarkers at and near visual field locations with demonstrable losses on conventional (Humphrey) perimetry. Similarly, SSVEP responses from different locations in the visual field will be correlated topographically with visual field loss patterns and to VIS OCT losses, with special emphasis on correlating structural damage in OFF vs ON sub-laminae of the IPL with the functional correlates derived from regional decremental and incremental SSVEPs. Separately and in combination, our structural and functional measurements are designed to provide strong tests of the biological hypothesis that the OFF pathway is preferentially damaged in human glaucoma, and to reveal new biomarkers for the disease. Improving visual outcomes in glaucoma will require a better understanding of the earliest sites and processes of damage and methods to measure them quickly and accurately in patients. This project will address both needs through a combination of novel Optical Coherence Tomography and electrophysiological measurements. The new imaging and electrophysiological tests that will be developed here, either separately or together, could eventually replace conventional visual field testing which is time-consuming and unreliable.",Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma,9765006,R01EY030361,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Noise', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perimetry', 'Process', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Rodent Model', 'Sampling', 'Scotoma', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual evoked cortical potential', 'base', 'cell injury', 'comparative', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'field study', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'sex']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,551932,560644462,0.25152115533656727
"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of glaucoma are important because the onset is insidious and the damage is irreversible. Advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used in the past 2 decades to improve the objective evaluation of glaucoma. OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing. Measuring the improvement in retinal circulation could be a quicker way to detect the benefit of glaucoma therapies that work through neuroprotection or regeneration, compared to monitoring VF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography is a high-resolution imaging technology that can non-invasively measure both the eye structures and small blood vessels that are damaged by glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can provide detailed measurement over wider areas inside the eye, detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, monitor disease progression, and provide more timely assessment of the effectiveness of therapy. A goal of this project is to determine if this objective imaging technology can provide information that is equivalent to or better than subjective visual field testing, which though time-consuming and poorly reliable, is the current gold standard for long-term monitoring and management of glaucoma.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,9697824,R01EY023285,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eyedrops', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trabeculectomy', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'cell injury', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'fiber cell', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'glaucoma surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'macula', 'neural network', 'neuroprotection', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'vascular factor', 'visual performance']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,564228,304670088,0.28418652256145194
"The nGoggle: A portable brain-based device for assessment of visual function deficits PROJECT SUMMARY Assessment of loss of visual function outside the foveal area is an essential component of the management of numerous conditions, including glaucoma, retinal and neurological disorders. Despite the significant progress achieved with the development of standard automated perimetry (SAP) many decades ago, assessment of visual field loss with SAP still has significant drawbacks. SAP testing is limited by subjectivity of patient responses and high test-retest variability, frequently requiring many tests for effective detection of change over time. Moreover, as these tests are generally conducted in clinic-based settings, limited patient availability and health care resources often result in an insufficient number of tests acquired over time, with delayed diagnosis and detection of disease progression. The requirement for highly trained technicians, cost, complexity, and lack of portability of SAP also preclude its use for screening of visual field loss in underserved populations. To address shortcomings of current methods to assess visual function, we have developed the nGoggle, a wearable device that uses a head-mounted display (HMD) integrated with wireless electroencephalography (EEG), capable of objectively assessing visual field deficits using multifocal steady-state visual-evoked potentials (mfSSVEP). As part of the funded NEI SBIR Phase I, we developed the nGoggle prototype using a modified smartphone-based HMD display and non-disposable electrodes. In our Phase I studies, we conducted benchmarking tests on signal quality of EEG acquisition, developed methods for EEG data extraction and analysis, and conducted a pilot study demonstrating the ability of the device to detect visual field loss in glaucoma, a progressive neuropathy that results in characteristic damage to the optic nerve and resulting visual field defects. We also identified limitations of current existing displays and electrodes, as well as potential avenues for enhancing test reliability and improving user interface. Based on the encouraging results from Phase I and a clear delineation of the steps needed to bring the device into its final commercial product form, we now propose a series of Phase II studies. We hypothesize that optimization of nGoggle's accuracy and repeatability in detecting visual function loss can be achieved through the development of a customized head-mounted display with front-view eye/pupil tracking cameras and disposable no-prep electrodes, as well as enhancement of the visual stimulation protocol and data analytics. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To develop a customized head-mounted display and enhanced no-prep electrodes for improving nGoggle's ability to acquire users' mfSSVEP with high signal-to- noise ratios (SNR) in response to visual stimulation; 2) To optimize and validate mfSSVEP stimuli design and data analytics to enhance the accuracy and repeatability of assessing visual function loss with the nGoggle. 3) Complete pivotal clinical studies to support FDA approval.

"Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1 Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at certain stages of the disease severity spectrum, specifically in the early stage and in advanced disease. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large between-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we build on our long-standing contribution to ocular imaging and propose novel and sensitive means to detect glaucoma and its progression that are optimized to the various stages of disease severity. We will use information gathered from visual fields (functional information) and a leading ocular imaging technology – optical coherence tomography (OCT; structural information) to map the capability of detecting changes across the entire disease severity spectrum to identify optimal parameters for each stage of the disease. Both commonly used parameters provided by the technologies and newly developed parameters with good diagnostic potential will be analyzed. We will use state-of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. We will also utilize a new imaging technology, the visible light OCT, to generate retinal images with outstanding resolution to extract information about the oxygen saturation of the tissue. This will provide in-vivo, real time, and noninvasive insight into tissue functionality. Taken together, this program will advance the use of structural and functional information with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1,9819321,R01EY013178,"['3-Dimensional', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Floor', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Pathology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Width', 'advanced disease', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'deep learning', 'density', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'instrument', 'invention', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'macula', 'mathematical methods', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'ocular imaging', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tissue oxygenation', 'tool']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,715489,329565273,0.18295358589223318
"GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT  Human locomotion through natural environments requires the coordination of all levels of the sensorimotor hierarchy, from the cortical areas involved in processing of visual information and high level planning to the subcortical and spinal structures involved in the regulation of the gait and posture. However, despite the complex neural bases of human locomotion, the output is highly regular and well organized around the basic physical dynamics and biomechanics that define the stability and energetic costs of moving a bipedal body through space. There is a rich and growing body of literature describing detailed knowledge each of the individual components of human locomotion, including neural mechanisms, muscular neuromechanics, and biomechanics. However, very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion through a complex and dynamic world. This lack of integrative research not only restricts the breadth of impact of research from these individual disciplines, but also limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, it is necessary to develop an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world. In service of this general goal, this proposal outlines research projects aimed at specific unanswered questions about locomotion over different terrains. This proposal comprises three specific research and training aims on the visual control of locomotion over rough terrain. Aim 1 focuses on the behavioral task itself, Aim 2 investigates the sensory stimulus experienced during real-world locomotion, and Aim 3 examines the motor integration of visually specified goals into the ongoing gait cycle. Aim 1 investigates effects of changing environmental uncertainty and task demands on gaze allocation strategies during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 2 analyzes and models the visual stimulus experienced during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 3 determines how visually specified target footholds and targets are integrated into the ongoing preferred steady-state gait. Together these aims will significantly advance our understanding of how humans use vision to control their movement through the natural world, which greatly increase our ability to develop clinical diagnosis and treatment for loss of locomotor function. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion.

"Machine Learning Methods for Detecting Disease-related Functional and Structural Change in Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to apply novel machine learning techniques to recently developed optical imaging measurement to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. Complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and advanced pattern recognition/machine learning-based analysis techniques can find and use that hidden information. We will use mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1,800 patient and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. We also will investigate deep learning and novel statistical techniques for this purpose. The required longitudinal measurements from several newly developed optical imaging techniques were not available to our previously funded NEI- supported work. The proposed work potentially can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care by informing clinical decision-making based on mathematically based, externally validated methods. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will improve machine learning techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments and will make use of a very large amount of data, obtained using previously awarded NIH funds, to do so. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neuro- degeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels.

OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing. Measuring the improvement in retinal circulation could be a quicker way to detect the benefit of glaucoma therapies that work through neuroprotection or regeneration, compared to monitoring VF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography is a high-resolution imaging technology that can non-invasively measure both the eye structures and small blood vessels that are damaged by glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can provide detailed measurement over wider areas inside the eye, detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, monitor disease progression, and provide more timely assessment of the effectiveness of therapy. A goal of this project is to determine if this objective imaging technology can provide information that is equivalent to or better than subjective visual field testing, which though time-consuming and poorly reliable, is the current gold standard for long-term monitoring and management of glaucoma.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,9564111,R01EY023285,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eyedrops', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trabeculectomy', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'cell injury', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'fiber cell', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'glaucoma surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'macula', 'neuroprotection', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'vascular factor', 'visual performance']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,564228,304670088,0.28418652256145194
"Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of chronic optic neuropathy and a major source of ocular morbidity worldwide. Understanding preclinical events, early phase disease and disease heterogeneity represent key objectives in early disease detection, prevention and treatment of POAG. In this study, we propose 4 specific aims. 1) We will perform both targeted and untargeted metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for POAG using pre-clinical serum from a large case-control group (500 cases and 500 controls) nested within ongoing prospective studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical events that precede POAG diagnosis (blood was collected ~ 10 years prior to disease diagnosis). Prior studies suggest that nitric oxide metabolites represent genetically informed markers and will form the basis for targeted profiling. 2) While considerable discoveries have been made of POAG genes, more work is needed to leverage genome-wide information to inform POAG etiology. Thus, we will create a genome-wide genetic correlation matrix between POAG and complex traits previously linked to POAG, using data from the NEIGHBORHOOD (National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database; 3800 POAG cases) consortium and publicly available summary genome-wide association study data. An assessment of the shared heritability between POAG and these traits as well as the relation between the genetic risk scores for these traits and POAG will lead to new etiologic insights. 3) New-onset POAG is clinically heterogeneous with variable visual field (VF) loss patterns that may reflect different etiologies. We will apply archetype analysis, which objectively quantifies a patient's VF loss pattern to 16 existing clinically validated archetypes (ATs), 9 of which are glaucomatous in nature. Each POAG case (n=1250 from NHS, NHS2 and HPFS) and10 matched controls will be assigned 16 weighted coefficients that add up to 1, with each value representing how consistent his / her VF loss pattern is with each glaucomatous AT. We will evaluate the differential relation between established POAG risk factors and the values on the 16 ATs, to identify unique risk factors for homogeneous incident POAG subtypes. 4) A carbohydrate-restricted diet may meet the energy requirement in the non-myelinated retinal ganglion cell axon segment of the optic nerve and reduce risk of POAG. We will conduct a prospective evaluation of this exposure in relation to POAG and POAG subtypes in the 3 cohorts (n=2100 cases). By integrating MWAS, genomics with prospective environmental exposure data and AT analysis, this proposal addresses a number of important knowledge gaps—in particular, it will shed light on how genetic and pre-diagnostic risk factors influence POAG and POAG heterogeneity. Linking specific exposures with POAG subtypes will provide important mechanistic understanding as well as evidence of causality, which will contribute to discovering precision medicine approaches for this condition. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure-related chronic optic nerve disease that produces characteristic visual loss patterns. In this proposal we will study a host of genes, plasma metabolites and environmental factors in relation to POAG overall as well as it's objectively determined subtypes based on visual loss pattern. Understanding how these various exposures relate to POAG and it's subtypes will highlight disease prevention strategies and precision medical treatment options for this potentially blinding disease that requires lifetime management.",Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma,9519600,R01EY015473,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Archives', 'Arginine', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biogenesis', 'Blindness', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Carbohydrates', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Citrulline', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Health Professional', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Pathway', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Optic Nerve', 'Ornithine', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Plasma', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'case control', 'cohort', 'common treatment', 'dietary restriction', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'targeted treatment', 'time interval', 'trait']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,571504,415711940,0.08714894451574623
"The nGoggle: A portable brain-based device for assessment of visual function deficits PROJECT SUMMARY Assessment of loss of visual function outside the foveal area is an essential component of the management of numerous conditions, including glaucoma, retinal and neurological disorders. Despite the significant progress achieved with the development of standard automated perimetry (SAP) many decades ago, assessment of visual field loss with SAP still has significant drawbacks. SAP testing is limited by subjectivity of patient responses and high test-retest variability, frequently requiring many tests for effective detection of change over time. Moreover, as these tests are generally conducted in clinic-based settings, limited patient availability and health care resources often result in an insufficient number of tests acquired over time, with delayed diagnosis and detection of disease progression. The requirement for highly trained technicians, cost, complexity, and lack of portability of SAP also preclude its use for screening of visual field loss in underserved populations. To address shortcomings of current methods to assess visual function, we have developed the nGoggle, a wearable device that uses a head-mounted display (HMD) integrated with wireless electroencephalography (EEG), capable of objectively assessing visual field deficits using multifocal steady-state visual-evoked potentials (mfSSVEP). As part of the funded NEI SBIR Phase I, we developed the nGoggle prototype using a modified smartphone-based HMD display and non-disposable electrodes. In our Phase I studies, we conducted benchmarking tests on signal quality of EEG acquisition, developed methods for EEG data extraction and analysis, and conducted a pilot study demonstrating the ability of the device to detect visual field loss in glaucoma, a progressive neuropathy that results in characteristic damage to the optic nerve and resulting visual field defects. We also identified limitations of current existing displays and electrodes, as well as potential avenues for enhancing test reliability and improving user interface. Based on the encouraging results from Phase I and a clear delineation of the steps needed to bring the device into its final commercial product form, we now propose a series of Phase II studies. We hypothesize that optimization of nGoggle's accuracy and repeatability in detecting visual function loss can be achieved through the development of a customized head-mounted display with front-view eye/pupil tracking cameras and disposable no-prep electrodes, as well as enhancement of the visual stimulation protocol and data analytics. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To develop a customized head-mounted display and enhanced no-prep electrodes for improving nGoggle's ability to acquire users' mfSSVEP with high signal-to- noise ratios (SNR) in response to visual stimulation; 2) To optimize and validate mfSSVEP stimuli design and data analytics to enhance the accuracy and repeatability of assessing visual function loss with the nGoggle. 3) Complete pivotal clinical studies to support FDA approval.

"Characterizing and Modeling Infants' Self-Generated Object Views: Implications for Object Recognition and Language Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human visual object recognition is foundational to many achievements—from object name learning to tool use to real world problem solving. Understanding the developmental processes that underlie visual object recognition is of critical importance because the individual differences that characterize early visual object recognition have clinical, educational, and societal implications. For instance, toddlers with poor visual object recognition skills are more likely to have below-average vocabulary sizes. Toddlers with smaller vocabularies have a greater likelihood of developing language impairments and are more likely to lag in pre-literacy and literacy skills. Deficits in visual object recognition and word learning have also been exhibited by individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ADSs). The overarching goal of the proposed project is to better understand the sensory-motor mechanisms that support visual object recognition. Considerable evidence suggests that active object manipulation relates to better visual object recognition, however little is known about the mechanisms through which object manipulation connects to visual object processing during development. The proposed research tests the hypothesis that one major route through which object manipulation matters is that it generates many different views of the same object, and that the variation within multiple visual instances of the same object facilitates visual object recognition by building more generalizable representations for recognizing unseen instances. This hypothesis is tested by (1) characterizing the properties of object information generated by infants during free play and by (2) evaluating the information in those generated visual streams by feeding them to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) – the first computational models of vision capable of human-like visual recognition. Two additional lines of research motivate the approach. First is evidence showing infants learn from statistical regularities in visual inputs presented briefly in a laboratory setting. Second is research using head-mounted cameras suggesting that object views generated by infant manipulation have unique properties, including views dominated by a single object. What we do not yet know are the visual statistics of the views infants generate in everyday toy play or their value for a statistical learner such as CNNs. The proposed research will address these gaps in the literature by characterizing the visual object inputs infants generate and how these inputs may facilitate visual object recognition. The proposed research will also determine how differences in visual inputs may be linked with individual differences in infant object name learning. This research will lead to a deeper understanding of the early development of visual object recognition, and may also provide a crucial missing link in our understanding of the developmental trajectory of other cognitive functions, including object name learning. Moreover, the knowledge to be gained from the proposed research has the potential to inform (1) individual differences in learning, (2) strategies for identifying learning delays, and (3) construction of interventions to remediate learning delays. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to characterize the nature of infants' early visual experiences of objects and their relation to object manipulation, language abilities, and computational models of object recognition. The period of development to be studied – 18 to 24 months – is a period in which delays in visual object recognition and in vocabulary learning have been connected to future development of language impairments and diagnoses of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). The proposed research is highly relevant to public health as it will elucidate sources of individual differences in early object recognition and word learning, laying the foundation for aiding diagnosis of early language delay and ASDs, as well as the development of future object recognition and vocabulary/language intervention programs.",Characterizing and Modeling Infants' Self-Generated Object Views: Implications for Object Recognition and Language Learning,9395459,F32HD093280,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Parents', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Toy', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'feeding', 'intervention program', 'language impairment', 'literacy', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'vision development', 'visual object processing', 'word learning']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F32,2017,57066,38099707,0.08348949077237092
"Machine Learning Methods for Detecting Disease-related Functional and Structural Change in Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to apply novel machine learning techniques to recently developed optical imaging measurement to improve the accurate prediction and detection of glaucomatous progression. Complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not fully used in current analyses, and advanced pattern recognition/machine learning-based analysis techniques can find and use that hidden information. We will use mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1,800 patient and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. We also will investigate deep learning and novel statistical techniques for this purpose. The required longitudinal measurements from several newly developed optical imaging techniques were not available to our previously funded NEI- supported work. The proposed work potentially can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care by informing clinical decision-making based on mathematically based, externally validated methods. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will improve machine learning techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments and will make use of a very large amount of data, obtained using previously awarded NIH funds, to do so. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neuro- degeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. The development of a clinically useful novel, empirical system for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can have a significant impact on the future of clinical care and on the future of clinical trials designed to investigate IOP lowering and neuroprotective drugs.",Machine Learning Methods for Detecting Disease-related Functional and Structural Change in Glaucoma,9298423,R21EY027945,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Onset of illness', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Perimetry', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Provider', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vision research', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual Pathways', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'expectation', 'glaucoma test', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'polarimetry', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tool']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2017,232500,524978793,0.15047203975400458

"Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a formal request for a career development award (K23) for an academic glaucoma specialist with a serious interest in the role of imaging in glaucoma using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This will allow the candidate to establish a clinical research program with the main goal of improving detection of glaucoma progression through macular imaging with spectral-domain OCT. By the time the proposed research is accomplished, the candidate will have preliminary data for continuing his research as an independent investigator and will have collected longitudinal structural and functional data in a group of advanced glaucoma patients that will serve as a platform for further improving detection of glaucoma progression with macular OCT imaging. The data will help the candidate provide preliminary results for a subsequent R01 that would potentially allow the PI to continue follow-up of the patients enrolled in the K23 award period.  I have a Master's of Science degree in Clinical Investigation under my belt and intend to deepen my skills in the field of imaging and biostatistics (to be used for enhancing and handling OCT images and for analyzing longitudinal data) by completing the proposed didactic program. By the end of the award period, I expect that I will have gained additional experience, knowledge, and mentorship required to prosper as an independent clinician-scientist in the field of glaucoma. My long-term goal is to carry out longitudinal studies of glaucoma patients where current and upcoming imaging and functional tests can be applied and their utility for detection of glaucoma progression can be investigated. I am confident that the combined skills and experience of my mentors will lead to a successful outcome for the proposed K award. I also envisage myself mentoring candidates like myself in future so that our collective knowledge and wisdom can be passed along to the next generation of aspiring clinician-scientists.  My objectives during the award period are as follows: 1) To develop an individual research program in glaucoma diagnostic imaging; 2) to successfully complete credited coursework in biomathematics, advanced biostatistics, computer vision (image processing), epidemiology, and ethical issues in research.  The main goal of the research component of this proposal is to better delineate the role of macular SD- OCT imaging for detection of glaucoma progression in advanced glaucoma. The specific aims through which this goal will be accomplished are as follows:  (1) To compare the performance of various global and regional macular measures to detect glaucoma.  The potential factors influencing the performance of various macular outcome measures will be explored. Such covariates include age, race, axial length, disc size, central corneal thickness,  OCT signal strength, and outer retinal thickness among others. I hypothesize that the thickness  of the outer retina (outer nuclear layer to retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch's membrane  complex) may be the most important factor explaining the measurement variability of the inner  retinal layer thickness (GCC or ganglion cell/inner plexiform layers).  (2) To determine and compare the utility of the candidate macular measures, detected through the first  aim, for detection of glaucoma progression in moderately advanced to severe glaucoma.  Moderately advanced to severe glaucoma will be defined as eyes with visual field mean  deviation worse than -6 dB or eyes with involvement of the central 10 degrees on the 24-2  visual field. It is widely accepted that measurement of the optic nerve head or RNFL parameters  in advanced glaucoma does not provide clinicians with much useful information. In contrast, the  central macular ganglion cells are the last to die in glaucoma. Macular imaging in advanced  glaucoma is directed towards this area where detection of change may still be possible. I  hypothesize that macular OCT parameters are valid structural outcome measures (biomarkers)  that can be used to follow the course of the disease in advanced glaucoma and that such  measures are significantly correlated with changes in the central visual field. Changes in the  macular measures over time will be first correlated with the corresponding visual field change  (functional progression) over time in eyes with moderately advanced to severe glaucoma. The  utility of the best candidate macular measures for predicting subsequent glaucoma progression  will also be explored and compared. I hypothesize that there may be a lag period between  progressive loss of macular ganglion cells and subsequent visual field progression in advanced  glaucoma, and therefore, detection of worsening in one or more macular outcome measures  can be used as a proxy for subsequent visual field progression.  Collectively, these studies will provide a solid foundation for better understanding and integration of macular OCT imaging in the care of glaucoma patients. Timely detection of glaucoma progression in the later stages can significantly reduce visual disability and blindness through earlier aggressive treatment and will potentially reduce glaucoma's financial burden to society. Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage. Even small amounts of progression in advanced glaucoma can have important consequences with regard to patient's visual function and quality of life. The results of the proposed study will potentially lead to more effective and earlier detection of glaucoma progression and will allow ophthalmologists to step up treatment in a timely manner.

"New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma ABSTRACT  This K99/R00 application supports additional research training in computational mathematics and computer vision which will enable Dr. Madhusudhanan Balasubramanian-the applicant, to become an independent multidisciplinary investigator in computational ophthalmology.

Training will be conducted via formal coursework, hands-on lab training, mentored research, progress review by an advisory committee, visiting collaborating researchers and regular attendance at seminars and workshops. The subsequent R00 independent research phase involves applying Dr. Balasubramanian's newly acquired computational techniques to the difficult task of identifying glaucomatous change over time from optical images of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer.  A documented presence of progressive optic neuropathy is the best gold standard currently available for glaucoma diagnosis. Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (CSLO) and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) are two of the optical imaging instruments available for monitoring the optic nerve head health in glaucoma diagnosis and management. Currently, several statistical and computational techniques are available for detecting localized glaucomatous changes from the CSLO exams. SD-OCT is a new generation ophthalmic imaging instrument based on the principle of optical interferometry. In contrast to the CSLO technology, SDOCT can resolve retinal layers from the internal limiting membrane (ILM) through the Bruch's membrane and can capture the 3-D architecture of the optic nerve head at a very high resolution. These high-resolution, high-dimensional volume scans introduce a new level of data complexity not seen in glaucoma progression analysis before and therefore, powerful (high-performance) computational techniques are required to fully utilize the high precision retinal measurements for glaucoma diagnosis. The central focus of this application in the K99 mentored phase of the application will be in 1) developing computational and statistical techniques for detecting structural glaucomatous changes in various retinal layers from the SDOCT scans, and 2) developing a new avenue of research in glaucoma management where in strain in retinal layers will be estimated non-invasively to characterize glaucomatous progression. In the R00 independent phase, the specific aims focus on developing 1) statistical and computational techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous change over time using 3-D SD-OCT volume scans and 2) a computational framework to estimate full-field 3-D volumetric strain from the standard SD-OCT scans.

"Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a formal request for a career development award (K23) for an academic glaucoma specialist with a serious interest in the role of imaging in glaucoma using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This will allow the candidate to establish a clinical research program with the main goal of improving detection of glaucoma progression through macular imaging with spectral-domain OCT. By the time the proposed research is accomplished, the candidate will have preliminary data for continuing his research as an independent investigator and will have collected longitudinal structural and functional data in a group of advanced glaucoma patients that will serve as a platform for further improving detection of glaucoma progression with macular OCT imaging. The data will help the candidate provide preliminary results for a subsequent R01 that would potentially allow the PI to continue follow-up of the patients enrolled in the K23 award period.  I have a Master's of Science degree in Clinical Investigation under my belt and intend to deepen my skills in the field of imaging and biostatistics (to be used for enhancing and handling OCT images and for analyzing longitudinal data) by completing the proposed didactic program. By the end of the award period, I expect that I will have gained additional experience, knowledge, and mentorship required to prosper as an independent clinician-scientist in the field of glaucoma. My long-term goal is to carry out longitudinal studies of glaucoma patients where current and upcoming imaging and functional tests can be applied and their utility for detection of glaucoma progression can be investigated. I am confident that the combined skills and experience of my mentors will lead to a successful outcome for the proposed K award. I also envisage myself mentoring candidates like myself in future so that our collective knowledge and wisdom can be passed along to the next generation of aspiring clinician-scientists.  My objectives during the award period are as follows: 1) To develop an individual research program in glaucoma diagnostic imaging; 2) to successfully complete credited coursework in biomathematics, advanced biostatistics, computer vision (image processing), epidemiology, and ethical issues in research.  The main goal of the research component of this proposal is to better delineate the role of macular SD- OCT imaging for detection of glaucoma progression in advanced glaucoma. The specific aims through which this goal will be accomplished are as follows:  (1) To compare the performance of various global and regional macular measures to detect glaucoma.  The potential factors influencing the performance of various macular outcome measures will be explored. Such covariates include age, race, axial length, disc size, central corneal thickness,  OCT signal strength, and outer retinal thickness among others. I hypothesize that the thickness  of the outer retina (outer nuclear layer to retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch's membrane  complex) may be the most important factor explaining the measurement variability of the inner  retinal layer thickness (GCC or ganglion cell/inner plexiform layers).  (2) To determine and compare the utility of the candidate macular measures, detected through the first  aim, for detection of glaucoma progression in moderately advanced to severe glaucoma.  Moderately advanced to severe glaucoma will be defined as eyes with visual field mean  deviation worse than -6 dB or eyes with involvement of the central 10 degrees on the 24-2  visual field. It is widely accepted that measurement of the optic nerve head or RNFL parameters  in advanced glaucoma does not provide clinicians with much useful information. In contrast, the  central macular ganglion cells are the last to die in glaucoma. Macular imaging in advanced  glaucoma is directed towards this area where detection of change may still be possible. I  hypothesize that macular OCT parameters are valid structural outcome measures (biomarkers)  that can be used to follow the course of the disease in advanced glaucoma and that such  measures are significantly correlated with changes in the central visual field. Changes in the  macular measures over time will be first correlated with the corresponding visual field change  (functional progression) over time in eyes with moderately advanced to severe glaucoma. The  utility of the best candidate macular measures for predicting subsequent glaucoma progression  will also be explored and compared. I hypothesize that there may be a lag period between  progressive loss of macular ganglion cells and subsequent visual field progression in advanced  glaucoma, and therefore, detection of worsening in one or more macular outcome measures  can be used as a proxy for subsequent visual field progression.  Collectively, these studies will provide a solid foundation for better understanding and integration of macular OCT imaging in the care of glaucoma patients. Timely detection of glaucoma progression in the later stages can significantly reduce visual disability and blindness through earlier aggressive treatment and will potentially reduce glaucoma's financial burden to society. Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage. Even small amounts of progression in advanced glaucoma can have important consequences with regard to patient's visual function and quality of life. The results of the proposed study will potentially lead to more effective and earlier detection of glaucoma progression and will allow ophthalmologists to step up treatment in a timely manner. This will in turn result in less visual morbidity and reduced blindness from glaucoma, which is projected to cause more than 10 million cases of legal blindness around the world in 2020.",Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging,8866409,K23EY022659,"['Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Caring', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cornea', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethical Issues', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal Blindness', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Master of Science', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'advanced disease', 'biomathematics', 'central visual field', 'clinical investigation', 'disability', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'macula', 'next generation', 'programs', 'retina outer nuclear layer', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'skills']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2015,229139,673201228,0.3036998484989626
"A Visual Assessment System for Retinal Function/Drug Discovery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preclinical evaluation of treatment strategies for retinal neurodegenerative diseases is highly dependent on mouse models. Classical methods to assess the visual function of animals, such as electroretinogram (ERG), which measures electrical responses in the retina, do not address connections between the eye and brain or visual perception by the visual system. This often raises concerns regarding the functional relevance of the therapeutic benefit. Difficulty in assessing visual perception and related behavior in mice and rats, largely due to their subtle visual behavior cues and the lack of adequate measuring devices, presents a critical barrier to the application of mouse models for evaluating treatment efficacy of new drugs, and for scaling up for behavior phenotyping to screen genetic vision defects. Pupillary light reflex (PLR) and optokinetic reflex (OKR) tests are useful methods in clinics for assessing human visual responses and perception. However, such tests have been difficult to conduct in rodents because current rodent visual testing methods or devices either do not allow accurate quantitative assessment for PLR or OKR or use subjective measures to score visual responses. To address these challenges, we propose to advance the technology by designing an easy-to-use automated platform that employs an eye/pupil tracking device equipped with a computer vision system (chiefly the interactive tracking system) for unambiguous objective scoring of visual responses. Our proposed new device will allow real-time quantitative and accurate assessment of rodent visual function including light responses, visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. The novelty of our system also lies in that it does not require complicated calibration procedures needed in commonly used human eye tracking. Rather than precisely measuring the extent of eye turning (or orientation), we propose to detect the signature eye movement in accordance with the speed and direction of visual stimuli. The system will be validated using normal wildtype mice and mouse models of retinal neurodegeneration known to develop visual behavior changes in the parameters mentioned above. Although rodent eye tracking has been investigated before, this proposed visual assessment system would be the first commercially viable product that uses an eye/pupil tracking device to automatically assess visual perception in rodents. The combined PLR and OKR tests and vastly simplified and automated quantification methods will also provide the first scalable behavior platform for phenotyping and drug discovery in the vision research area. In the future, this technology has the potential of being expanded to measure responses from various visual stimuli. This may translate into broader applications for evaluating brain diseases that afflict the visual pathways. This platform for mouse visual behavior assessment will therefore greatly facilitate drug discovery and development aimed at preventing and slowing vision loss or restoring sight, helping to combat devastating blinding conditions such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of the current proposal is to design and develop an automated system for the measure of rodent (mice and rats) light response, visual acuity, and contrast sensitivity. The system will apply human eye/pupil tracking techniques for objective and unambiguous evaluation of light response and visual perception. This platform will provide a powerful tool for phenotypic studies as well as for discovery of new drugs that can prevent or restore sight caused by blinding conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma.                ",A Visual Assessment System for Retinal Function/Drug Discovery,8980787,R41EY025913,"['Address', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Coma', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Cues', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electroretinography', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Eye diseases', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Screening', 'Glaucoma', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Procedures', 'Pupil', 'Pupil light reflex', 'Rattus', 'Reflex action', 'Research Institute', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Rodent', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Pathways', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual system structure', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'combat', 'commercialization', 'computer generated', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'genetic approach', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'liquid crystal', 'mouse model', 'new technology', 'performance tests', 'photoreceptor degeneration', 'preclinical evaluation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'scale up', 'success', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'treatment strategy', 'visual performance', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,"AFASCI, INC.",R41,2015,233235,2183236,0.12076171124326544

"Neural and Behavioral Interactions Between Attention, Perception, and Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this research is to characterize how perception and memory interact, in terms of both the learning mechanisms that help transform visual experience into memory, and the intentional mechanisms that regulate this transformation. The specific goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that incidental learning about statistical regularities in vision (visual statistical learning) is limited to selectively attend visual information, and that this behavioral interaction arises because of how selective attention modulates neural interactions between human visual and memory systems. We propose a two-stage framework in which selective attention to a high-level visual feature/category increases neural interactions between regions of occipital cortex that represent low-level features and the region of inferior temporal cortex (IT) that represents the attended feature/category, and in turn between this IT region and medial temporal lobe (MTL) sub regions involved in visual learning and memory. In addition to assessing how feature-based selective attention influences learning at a behavioral level, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess how attention influences evoked neural responses in task-relevant brain regions, as well as neural interactions between these regions in the background of ongoing tasks. We will develop an innovative approach for studying neural interactions in which evoked responses and global noise sources are scrubbed from the data and regional correlations are assessed in the residuals. This background connectivity approach provides a new way to study how intentional goals affect perception and learning. Aim 1 examines the first stage of our framework, testing: how selective attention modulates background connectivity between IT and occipital cortex, where in retinotopic visual cortex this modulation occurs, and how these changes are controlled by frontal and parietal cortex. Aim 2 examines the second stage of our framework, first establishing the role of the MTL in visual statistical learning, and then testing: how selective attention modulates interactions between IT and the MTL, where in cortical and hippocampal sub regions of the MTL this modulation occurs, and how these changes facilitate incidental learning about statistical regularities and later retrieval of this knowledge. In sum, we relate behavioral interactions between selective attention and learning to neural interactions between the mechanisms that represent visual features and those that learn about their relations. This proposal addresses several key issues in the field, including: how attention modulates the MTL, how feature-based attention is controlled, whether different neural mechanisms support rapid versus long-term visual learning, how tasks and goals are represented, and how attention and memory retrieval are related. This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery and rehabilitation of visual function following eye disease, injury, or brain damage.

"Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a formal request for a career development award (K23) for an academic glaucoma specialist with a serious interest in the role of imaging in glaucoma using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This will allow the candidate to establish a clinical research program with the main goal of improving detection of glaucoma progression through macular imaging with spectral-domain OCT. By the time the proposed research is accomplished, the candidate will have preliminary data for continuing his research as an independent investigator and will have collected longitudinal structural and functional data in a group of advanced glaucoma patients that will serve as a platform for further improving detection of glaucoma progression with macular OCT imaging. The data will help the candidate provide preliminary results for a subsequent R01 that would potentially allow the PI to continue follow-up of the patients enrolled in the K23 award period.  I have a Master's of Science degree in Clinical Investigation under my belt and intend to deepen my skills in the field of imaging and biostatistics (to be used for enhancing and handling OCT images and for analyzing longitudinal data) by completing the proposed didactic program. By the end of the award period, I expect that I will have gained additional experience, knowledge, and mentorship required to prosper as an independent clinician-scientist in the field of glaucoma. My long-term goal is to carry out longitudinal studies of glaucoma patients where current and upcoming imaging and functional tests can be applied and their utility for detection of glaucoma progression can be investigated. I am confident that the combined skills and experience of my mentors will lead to a successful outcome for the proposed K award. I also envisage myself mentoring candidates like myself in future so that our collective knowledge and wisdom can be passed along to the next generation of aspiring clinician-scientists.  My objectives during the award period are as follows: 1) To develop an individual research program in glaucoma diagnostic imaging; 2) to successfully complete credited coursework in biomathematics, advanced biostatistics, computer vision (image processing), epidemiology, and ethical issues in research.  The main goal of the research component of this proposal is to better delineate the role of macular SD- OCT imaging for detection of glaucoma progression in advanced glaucoma. The specific aims through which this goal will be accomplished are as follows:  (1) To compare the performance of various global and regional macular measures to detect glaucoma.  The potential factors influencing the performance of various macular outcome measures will be explored. Such covariates include age, race, axial length, disc size, central corneal thickness,  OCT signal strength, and outer retinal thickness among others. I hypothesize that the thickness  of the outer retina (outer nuclear layer to retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch's membrane  complex) may be the most important factor explaining the measurement variability of the inner  retinal layer thickness (GCC or ganglion cell/inner plexiform layers).  (2) To determine and compare the utility of the candidate macular measures, detected through the first  aim, for detection of glaucoma progression in moderately advanced to severe glaucoma.  Moderately advanced to severe glaucoma will be defined as eyes with visual field mean  deviation worse than -6 dB or eyes with involvement of the central 10 degrees on the 24-2  visual field. It is widely accepted that measurement of the optic nerve head or RNFL parameters  in advanced glaucoma does not provide clinicians with much useful information. In contrast, the  central macular ganglion cells are the last to die in glaucoma. Macular imaging in advanced  glaucoma is directed towards this area where detection of change may still be possible. I  hypothesize that macular OCT parameters are valid structural outcome measures (biomarkers)  that can be used to follow the course of the disease in advanced glaucoma and that such  measures are significantly correlated with changes in the central visual field. Changes in the  macular measures over time will be first correlated with the corresponding visual field change  (functional progression) over time in eyes with moderately advanced to severe glaucoma. The  utility of the best candidate macular measures for predicting subsequent glaucoma progression  will also be explored and compared. I hypothesize that there may be a lag period between  progressive loss of macular ganglion cells and subsequent visual field progression in advanced  glaucoma, and therefore, detection of worsening in one or more macular outcome measures  can be used as a proxy for subsequent visual field progression.  Collectively, these studies will provide a solid foundation for better understanding and integration of macular OCT imaging in the care of glaucoma patients. Timely detection of glaucoma progression in the later stages can significantly reduce visual disability and blindness through earlier aggressive treatment and will potentially reduce glaucoma's financial burden to society.          Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage. Even small amounts of progression in advanced glaucoma can have important consequences with regard to patient's visual function and quality of life. The results of the proposed study will potentially lead to more effective and earlier detection of glaucoma progression and will allow ophthalmologists to step up treatment in a timely manner. This will in turn result in less visual morbidity and reduced blindness from glaucoma, which is projected to cause more than 10 million cases of legal blindness around the world in 2020.

"New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma ABSTRACT  This K99/R00 application supports additional research training in computational mathematics and computer vision which will enable Dr. Madhusudhanan Balasubramanian-the applicant, to become an independent multidisciplinary investigator in computational ophthalmology. Specifically, in the K99 training phase of this grant, Dr. Balasubramanian will train at UC San Diego under the direction of Linda Zangwill PhD, an established glaucoma clinical researcher in the Department of Ophthalmology, as well as a team of co- mentors, including, Dr. Michael Holst from the Department of Mathematics and co-director for the Center for Computational Mathematics, and co-director of the Comptutational Science, Mathematics and Engineering and Dr. David Kriegman from Computer Science and Engineering. Training will be conducted via formal coursework, hands-on lab training, mentored research, progress review by an advisory committee, visiting collaborating researchers and regular attendance at seminars and workshops. The subsequent R00 independent research phase involves applying Dr. Balasubramanian's newly acquired computational techniques to the difficult task of identifying glaucomatous change over time from optical images of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer.  A documented presence of progressive optic neuropathy is the best gold standard currently available for glaucoma diagnosis. Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (CSLO) and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) are two of the optical imaging instruments available for monitoring the optic nerve head health in glaucoma diagnosis and management. Currently, several statistical and computational techniques are available for detecting localized glaucomatous changes from the CSLO exams. SD-OCT is a new generation ophthalmic imaging instrument based on the principle of optical interferometry. In contrast to the CSLO technology, SDOCT can resolve retinal layers from the internal limiting membrane (ILM) through the Bruch's membrane and can capture the 3-D architecture of the optic nerve head at a very high resolution. These high-resolution, high-dimensional volume scans introduce a new level of data complexity not seen in glaucoma progression analysis before and therefore, powerful (high-performance) computational techniques are required to fully utilize the high precision retinal measurements for glaucoma diagnosis. The central focus of this application in the K99 mentored phase of the application will be in 1) developing computational and statistical techniques for detecting structural glaucomatous changes in various retinal layers from the SDOCT scans, and 2) developing a new avenue of research in glaucoma management where in strain in retinal layers will be estimated non-invasively to characterize glaucomatous progression. In the R00 independent phase, the specific aims focus on developing 1) statistical and computational techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous change over time using 3-D SD-OCT volume scans and 2) a computational framework to estimate full-field 3-D volumetric strain from the standard SD-OCT scans. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Detecting the onset and progression of glaucomatous changes in the eye is central to glaucoma diagnosis and management. This multidisciplinary project focuses on developing powerful (high-performance) computational, mathematical, and statistical techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous changes from the Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (CSLO) scans and volumetric Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) scans of the optic nerve head. In addition, the Principal Investigator of this proposal will receive extensive training in the areas of computational mathematics and computer vision to augment and strengthen his multidisciplinary expertise essential to execute the proposed specific aims.",New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma,8786916,R00EY020518,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Blindness', 'Brain imaging', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Cardiology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastroenterology', 'Generations', 'Genetic screening method', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Interferometry', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Eye Institute', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Onset of illness', 'Ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visit', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'blood flow measurement', 'cancer imaging', 'computer framework', 'computer science', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mathematical sciences', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'symposium', 'time use']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R00,2014,248999,6013508,0.18189956516788128
"Constraints on Visual Statistical Learning in Infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual statistical learning is the process of identifying patterns of probabilistic co-occurrence among visual features, essential to our ability to perceivethe world as predictable and stable.

"Neural and Behavioral Interactions Between Attention, Perception, and Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this research is to characterize how perception and memory interact, in terms of both the learning mechanisms that help transform visual experience into memory, and the intentional mechanisms that regulate this transformation. The specific goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that incidental learning about statistical regularities in vision (visual statistical learning) is limited to selectively attend visual information, and that this behavioral interaction arises because of how selective attention modulates neural interactions between human visual and memory systems. We propose a two-stage framework in which selective attention to a high-level visual feature/category increases neural interactions between regions of occipital cortex that represent low-level features and the region of inferior temporal cortex (IT) that represents the attended feature/category, and in turn between this IT region and medial temporal lobe (MTL) sub regions involved in visual learning and memory. In addition to assessing how feature-based selective attention influences learning at a behavioral level, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess how attention influences evoked neural responses in task-relevant brain regions, as well as neural interactions between these regions in the background of ongoing tasks. We will develop an innovative approach for studying neural interactions in which evoked responses and global noise sources are scrubbed from the data and regional correlations are assessed in the residuals. This background connectivity approach provides a new way to study how intentional goals affect perception and learning. Aim 1 examines the first stage of our framework, testing: how selective attention modulates background connectivity between IT and occipital cortex, where in retinotopic visual cortex this modulation occurs, and how these changes are controlled by frontal and parietal cortex. Aim 2 examines the second stage of our framework, first establishing the role of the MTL in visual statistical learning, and then testing: how selective attention modulates interactions between IT and the MTL, where in cortical and hippocampal sub regions of the MTL this modulation occurs, and how these changes facilitate incidental learning about statistical regularities and later retrieval of this knowledge. In sum, we relate behavioral interactions between selective attention and learning to neural interactions between the mechanisms that represent visual features and those that learn about their relations. This proposal addresses several key issues in the field, including: how attention modulates the MTL, how feature-based attention is controlled, whether different neural mechanisms support rapid versus long-term visual learning, how tasks and goals are represented, and how attention and memory retrieval are related.

In addition to assessing how feature-based selective attention influences learning at a behavioral level, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess how attention influences evoked neural responses in task-relevant brain regions, as well as neural interactions between these regions in the background of ongoing tasks. We will develop an innovative approach for studying neural interactions in which evoked responses and global noise sources are scrubbed from the data and regional correlations are assessed in the residuals. This background connectivity approach provides a new way to study how intentional goals affect perception and learning. Aim 1 examines the first stage of our framework, testing: how selective attention modulates background connectivity between IT and occipital cortex, where in retinotopic visual cortex this modulation occurs, and how these changes are controlled by frontal and parietal cortex. Aim 2 examines the second stage of our framework, first establishing the role of the MTL in visual statistical learning, and then testing: how selective attention modulates interactions between IT and the MTL, where in cortical and hippocampal sub regions of the MTL this modulation occurs, and how these changes facilitate incidental learning about statistical regularities and later retrieval of this knowledge. In sum, we relate behavioral interactions between selective attention and learning to neural interactions between the mechanisms that represent visual features and those that learn about their relations. This proposal addresses several key issues in the field, including: how attention modulates the MTL, how feature-based attention is controlled, whether different neural mechanisms support rapid versus long-term visual learning, how tasks and goals are represented, and how attention and memory retrieval are related. This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery and rehabilitation of visual function following eye disease, injury, or brain damage.        This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery from visual impairment caused by eye disease, injury, or brain damage. The behavioral tasks that we develop to enhance learning with attention will inform practices for rehabilitating visual function, and the methods that we develop to study neural interactions during tasks will lead to new approaches for diagnosing disorders of visual processing.

"New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma  ABSTRACT  This K99/R00 application supports additional research training in computational mathematics and computer vision which will enable Dr. Madhusudhanan Balasubramanian-the applicant, to become an independent multidisciplinary investigator in computational ophthalmology. Specifically, in the K99 training phase of this grant, Dr. Balasubramanian will train at UC San Diego under the direction of Linda Zangwill PhD, an established glaucoma clinical researcher in the Department of Ophthalmology, as well as a team of co- mentors, including, Dr. Michael Holst from the Department of Mathematics and co-director for the Center for Computational Mathematics, and co-director of the Comptutational Science, Mathematics and Engineering and Dr. David Kriegman from Computer Science and Engineering. Training will be conducted via formal coursework, hands-on lab training, mentored research, progress review by an advisory committee, visiting collaborating researchers and regular attendance at seminars and workshops. The subsequent R00 independent research phase involves applying Dr. Balasubramanian's newly acquired computational techniques to the difficult task of identifying glaucomatous change over time from optical images of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer.  A documented presence of progressive optic neuropathy is the best gold standard currently available for glaucoma diagnosis. Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (CSLO) and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) are two of the optical imaging instruments available for monitoring the optic nerve head health in glaucoma diagnosis and management. Currently, several statistical and computational techniques are available for detecting localized glaucomatous changes from the CSLO exams. SD-OCT is a new generation ophthalmic imaging instrument based on the principle of optical interferometry. In contrast to the CSLO technology, SDOCT can resolve retinal layers from the internal limiting membrane (ILM) through the Bruch's membrane and can capture the 3-D architecture of the optic nerve head at a very high resolution. These high-resolution, high-dimensional volume scans introduce a new level of data complexity not seen in glaucoma progression analysis before and therefore, powerful (high-performance) computational techniques are required to fully utilize the high precision retinal measurements for glaucoma diagnosis. The central focus of this application in the K99 mentored phase of the application will be in 1) developing computational and statistical techniques for detecting structural glaucomatous changes in various retinal layers from the SDOCT scans, and 2) developing a new avenue of research in glaucoma management where in strain in retinal layers will be estimated non-invasively to characterize glaucomatous progression. In the R00 independent phase, the specific aims focus on developing 1) statistical and computational techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous change over time using 3-D SD-OCT volume scans and 2) a computational framework to estimate full-field 3-D volumetric strain from the standard SD-OCT scans.  PROJECT NARRATIVE  Detecting the onset and progression of glaucomatous changes in the eye is central to glaucoma diagnosis and management.

"Detection of Glaucoma Progression with Macular OCT Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a formal request for a career development award (K23) for an academic glaucoma specialist with a serious interest in the role of imaging in glaucoma using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This will allow the candidate to establish a clinical research program with the main goal of improving detection of glaucoma progression through macular imaging with spectral-domain OCT. By the time the proposed research is accomplished, the candidate will have preliminary data for continuing his research as an independent investigator and will have collected longitudinal structural and functional data in a group of advanced glaucoma patients that will serve as a platform for further improving detection of glaucoma progression with macular OCT imaging. The data will help the candidate provide preliminary results for a subsequent R01 that would potentially allow the PI to continue follow-up of the patients enrolled in the K23 award period.  I have a Master's of Science degree in Clinical Investigation under my belt and intend to deepen my skills in the field of imaging and biostatistics (to be used for enhancing and handling OCT images and for analyzing longitudinal data) by completing the proposed didactic program. By the end of the award period, I expect that I will have gained additional experience, knowledge, and mentorship required to prosper as an independent clinician-scientist in the field of glaucoma. My long-term goal is to carry out longitudinal studies of glaucoma patients where current and upcoming imaging and functional tests can be applied and their utility for detection of glaucoma progression can be investigated. I am confident that the combined skills and experience of my mentors will lead to a successful outcome for the proposed K award. I also envisage myself mentoring candidates like myself in future so that our collective knowledge and wisdom can be passed along to the next generation of aspiring clinician-scientists.  My objectives during the award period are as follows: 1) To develop an individual research program in glaucoma diagnostic imaging; 2) to successfully complete credited coursework in biomathematics, advanced biostatistics, computer vision (image processing), epidemiology, and ethical issues in research.  The main goal of the research component of this proposal is to better delineate the role of macular SD- OCT imaging for detection of glaucoma progression in advanced glaucoma. The specific aims through which this goal will be accomplished are as follows:  (1) To compare the performance of various global and regional macular measures to detect glaucoma.  The potential factors influencing the performance of various macular outcome measures will be explored. Such covariates include age, race, axial length, disc size, central corneal thickness,  OCT signal strength, and outer retinal thickness among others. I hypothesize that the thickness  of the outer retina (outer nuclear layer to retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch's membrane  complex) may be the most important factor explaining the measurement variability of the inner  retinal layer thickness (GCC or ganglion cell/inner plexiform layers).  (2) To determine and compare the utility of the candidate macular measures, detected through the first  aim, for detection of glaucoma progression in moderately advanced to severe glaucoma.  Moderately advanced to severe glaucoma will be defined as eyes with visual field mean  deviation worse than -6 dB or eyes with involvement of the central 10 degrees on the 24-2  visual field. It is widely accepted that measurement of the optic nerve head or RNFL parameters  in advanced glaucoma does not provide clinicians with much useful information. In contrast, the  central macular ganglion cells are the last to die in glaucoma. Macular imaging in advanced  glaucoma is directed towards this area where detection of change may still be possible. I  hypothesize that macular OCT parameters are valid structural outcome measures (biomarkers)  that can be used to follow the course of the disease in advanced glaucoma and that such  measures are significantly correlated with changes in the central visual field. Changes in the  macular measures over time will be first correlated with the corresponding visual field change  (functional progression) over time in eyes with moderately advanced to severe glaucoma. The  utility of the best candidate macular measures for predicting subsequent glaucoma progression  will also be explored and compared. I hypothesize that there may be a lag period between  progressive loss of macular ganglion cells and subsequent visual field progression in advanced  glaucoma, and therefore, detection of worsening in one or more macular outcome measures  can be used as a proxy for subsequent visual field progression.  Collectively, these studies will provide a solid foundation for better understanding and integration of macular OCT imaging in the care of glaucoma patients. Timely detection of glaucoma progression in the later stages can significantly reduce visual disability and blindness through earlier aggressive treatment and will potentially reduce glaucoma's financial burden to society.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage. Even small amounts of progression in advanced glaucoma can have important consequences with regard to patient's visual function and quality of life. The results of the proposed study will potentially lead to more effective and earlier detection of glaucoma progression and will allow ophthalmologists to step up treatment in a timely manner. This will in turn result in less visual morbidity and reduced blindness from glaucoma, which is projected to cause more than 10 million cases of legal blindness around the world in 2020.              Detection of glaucoma progression remains a challenging task in eyes demonstrating significant damage.

"Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed work is to understand how learning by the visual system helps it to represent the immediate environment during perception. Because perception is accurate, we can know spatial layout: the shapes, orientations, sizes, and spatial locations of the objects and surfaces around us. But this accuracy requires that the visual system learn over time how best to interpret visual ""cues"". These cues are the signals from the environment that the visual system extracts from the retinal images that are informative about spatial layout. Known cues include binocular disparity, texture gradients, occlusion relations, motion parallax, and familiar size, to name a few. How do these cues come to be interpreted correctly? A fundamental problem is that visual cues are ambiguous. Even if cues could be measured exactly (which they cannot, the visual system being a physical device) there would still be different possible 3D interpretations for a given set of cues. As a result, the visual system is forced to operate probabilistically: the way things ""look"" to us reflects an implicit guess as to which interpretation of the cues is most likely to be correct. Each additional cue helps improve the guess. For example, the retinal image of a door could be interpreted as a vertical rectangle or as some other quadrilateral at a non-vertical orientation in space, and the shadow cues at the bottom of the door helps the system know that it's a vertical rectangle. What mechanisms do the visual system use to discern which cues are available for interpreting images correctly? The proposed work aims to answer this fundamental question about perceptual learning. It was recently shown that the visual system can detect and start using new cues for perception. This phenomenon can be studied in the laboratory using classical conditioning procedures that were previously developed to study learning in animals. In the proposed experiments, a model system is used to understand details about when this learning occurs and what is learned. The data will be compared to predictions based on older, analogous studies in the animal learning literature, and interpreted in the context of Bayesian statistical inference, especially machine learning theory.

"Neural and Behavioral Interactions Between Attention, Perception, and Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this research is to characterize how perception and memory interact, in terms of both the learning mechanisms that help transform visual experience into memory, and the intentional mechanisms that regulate this transformation. The specific goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that incidental learning about statistical regularities in vision (visual statistical learning) is limited to selectively attend visual information, and that this behavioral interaction arises because of how selective attention modulates neural interactions between human visual and memory systems. We propose a two-stage framework in which selective attention to a high-level visual feature/category increases neural interactions between regions of occipital cortex that represent low-level features and the region of inferior temporal cortex (IT) that represents the attended feature/category, and in turn between this IT region and medial temporal lobe (MTL) sub regions involved in visual learning and memory. In addition to assessing how feature-based selective attention influences learning at a behavioral level, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess how attention influences evoked neural responses in task-relevant brain regions, as well as neural interactions between these regions in the background of ongoing tasks. We will develop an innovative approach for studying neural interactions in which evoked responses and global noise sources are scrubbed from the data and regional correlations are assessed in the residuals. This background connectivity approach provides a new way to study how intentional goals affect perception and learning. Aim 1 examines the first stage of our framework, testing: how selective attention modulates background connectivity between IT and occipital cortex, where in retinotopic visual cortex this modulation occurs, and how these changes are controlled by frontal and parietal cortex. Aim 2 examines the second stage of our framework, first establishing the role of the MTL in visual statistical learning, and then testing: how selective attention modulates interactions between IT and the MTL, where in cortical and hippocampal sub regions of the MTL this modulation occurs, and how these changes facilitate incidental learning about statistical regularities and later retrieval of this knowledge. In sum, we relate behavioral interactions between selective attention and learning to neural interactions between the mechanisms that represent visual features and those that learn about their relations. This proposal addresses several key issues in the field, including: how attention modulates the MTL, how feature-based attention is controlled, whether different neural mechanisms support rapid versus long-term visual learning, how tasks and goals are represented, and how attention and memory retrieval are related. This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery and rehabilitation of visual function following eye disease, injury, or brain damage.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning.

"Computer analysis of optic disc images in glaucoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma diagnosis, management and research depend on complex judgments of the optic disc (or optic nerve head), visual field and intraocular pressure. The current standard of optic disc evaluation requires qualitative observer judgments of stereoscopic photographs of the optic disc, a less than optimal method. Despite much research, no methods have yet conclusively improved over this conventional Approach: Contemporary optic disc analyzers typically use instrument-specific image capture methods and derive quantitative estimates for various anatomical features of the optic disc. Our goal is to improve the methods of optic disc diagnosis by applying advanced image analysis methods from computer engineering to the essential diagnostic problem in glaucoma - detecting change or stability in optic disc images over time. Expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in clinical glaucoma, translational research (R. Stone, PI; E. Miller, J. Piltz-Seymour and others) and biostatistics (M. Maguire, G.-S. Ying) is merged with engineering expertise in computer image analysis at Sarnoff Corporation (B. Hanna, H.

Our plan to address stereo primarily differs from other approaches to optic nerve analysis, but it offers many advantages for validation, clinical care and research not possible with the instrument-specific formats of contemporary fundus analyzers. Requiring only a personal computer and software to analyze optic disc images, our approach is clinically intuitive, can accommodate improvements in software and camera technology, is compatible with many image formats, permits use of archived fundus photos and is cost-effective.

"Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed work is to understand how learning by the visual system helps it to represent the immediate environment during perception. Because perception is accurate, we can know spatial layout: the shapes, orientations, sizes, and spatial locations of the objects and surfaces around us. But this accuracy requires that the visual system learn over time how best to interpret visual ""cues"". These cues are the signals from the environment that the visual system extracts from the retinal images that are informative about spatial layout. Known cues include binocular disparity, texture gradients, occlusion relations, motion parallax, and familiar size, to name a few. How do these cues come to be interpreted correctly? A fundamental problem is that visual cues are ambiguous. Even if cues could be measured exactly (which they cannot, the visual system being a physical device) there would still be different possible 3D interpretations for a given set of cues. As a result, the visual system is forced to operate probabilistically: the way things ""look"" to us reflects an implicit guess as to which interpretation of the cues is most likely to be correct. Each additional cue helps improve the guess. For example, the retinal image of a door could be interpreted as a vertical rectangle or as some other quadrilateral at a non-vertical orientation in space, and the shadow cues at the bottom of the door helps the system know that it's a vertical rectangle. What mechanisms do the visual system use to discern which cues are available for interpreting images correctly? The proposed work aims to answer this fundamental question about perceptual learning. It was recently shown that the visual system can detect and start using new cues for perception. This phenomenon can be studied in the laboratory using classical conditioning procedures that were previously developed to study learning in animals. In the proposed experiments, a model system is used to understand details about when this learning occurs and what is learned.

"Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma: Clinical Electrophysiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to investigate the diagnostic precision for detecting glaucoma of clinical electrophysiological measurement (pattern electroretinogram, PERG; and multifocal visual evoked potentials, mfVEP), a technique identified as an important recent glaucoma- related development in eye research by the 2004 National Eye Institute (NEI) National Plan. Aim 1: Electrophysiological responses will be characterized in glaucoma, suspect and healthy eyes and the diagnostic accuracy of these commercially available techniques will be compared to current reference standards (evaluation of stereoscopic photographs of the optic disc and standard automated perimetry) and to recently developed diagnostic techniques including optical imaging of the optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, optical coherence tomography, and scanning laser polarimetry) and visual function-specific perimetry (short-wavelength automated perimetry and frequency doubling technology perimetry). Aim 2: Novel use of machine learning classifier techniques (e.g. relevance vector machines, support vector machines, mixture of Gaussian techniques, independent components analysis) will be applied to electrophysiological data to improve its diagnostic accuracy and data from different diagnostic techniques (named above) will be combined to improve overall diagnostic accuracy. Aim 3: Electrophysiological measurements will be validated as functional indicators of optic nerve damage by examining the relationship between electrophysiological abnormality and optic disc and RNFL damage in glaucoma and glaucoma suspect patients. 210 patients (105 glaucoma's, 105 glaucoma suspects) and 105 healthy participants will be enrolled and studied cross-sectionally. The specific aims of this proposal address the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset, determining functional correlates of optic nerve damage, and characterizing glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. Information about the relative usefulness of electrophysiological measurement, optical imaging techniques, and ganglion cell-specific perimetry for glaucoma detection is important to the clinical community for determining future evidence-based changes in standard of care for glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. These studies will demonstrate the relative usefulness of electrophysiological measurement (pattern electroretinogram, PERG; multi-focal visual evoked potential, mfVEP) compared to optical imaging techniques (confocal scanning ophthalmoscopy, optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry) and ganglion cell-specific perimetry (short wavelength and frequency doubling perimetry) for glaucoma detection.

The data will be compared to predictions based on older, analogous studies in the animal learning literature, and interpreted in the context of Bayesian statistical inference, especially machine learning theory. The proposed work benefits public health by characterizing the brain mechanisms that keep visual perception accurate. These mechanisms are at work in the many months during which a person with congenital cataracts learns to use vision after the cataracts are removed, and it is presumably these mechanisms that go awry when an individual with a family history of synesthesia or autism develops anomalous experience-dependent perceptual responses. Neurodegenerative diseases may disrupt visual learning, in which case visual learning tests could be used to detect disease; understanding the learning of new cues in human vision could lead to better computerized aids for the visually impaired; and knowing what causes a new cue to be learned could lead to new technologies for training people to perceive accurately in novel work environments.          n/a",Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception,7388324,R01EY013988,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Appearance', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Binocular Vision', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Cataract', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Depth', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family history of', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Pathology', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Rate', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rotation', 'Shadowing (Histology)', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'Vision Disparity', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'area MT', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'concept', 'congenital cataract', 'design', 'devices for the visually impaired', 'experience', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'size', 'stereoscopic', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual information', 'visual learning', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,STATE COLLEGE OF OPTOMETRY,R01,2008,228847,2237141,0.1274267244854565
"Computer analysis of optic disc images in glaucoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma diagnosis, management and research depend on complex judgments of the optic disc (or optic nerve head), visual field and intraocular pressure. The current standard of optic disc evaluation requires qualitative observer judgments of stereoscopic photographs of the optic disc, a less than optimal method. Despite much research, no methods have yet conclusively improved over this conventional Approach: Contemporary optic disc analyzers typically use instrument-specific image capture methods and derive quantitative estimates for various anatomical features of the optic disc. Our goal is to improve the methods of optic disc diagnosis by applying advanced image analysis methods from computer engineering to the essential diagnostic problem in glaucoma - detecting change or stability in optic disc images over time. Expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in clinical glaucoma, translational research (R. Stone, PI; E. Miller, J. Piltz-Seymour and others) and biostatistics (M. Maguire, G.-S. Ying) is merged with engineering expertise in computer image analysis at Sarnoff Corporation (B. Hanna, H. Sawhney, and others) in a Bioengineering Research Partnership with four Specific Aims: 1) Develop and validate robust registration algorithms for automatic alignment of optic disc images; 2) Develop an automated multiple-view analysis approach to extract relative, local change parameters from optic disc stereo images; 3) Develop interactive tools to assist in observer grading of optic disc images and in clinical interpretation of the automated change detection and stereoscopic algorithms; and 4) Conduct initial validation studies of the optic disc change detection tools. Our plan to address stereo primarily differs from other approaches to optic nerve analysis, but it offers many advantages for validation, clinical care and research not possible with the instrument-specific formats of contemporary fundus analyzers. Requiring only a personal computer and software to analyze optic disc images, our approach is clinically intuitive, can accommodate improvements in software and camera technology, is compatible with many image formats, permits use of archived fundus photos and is cost-effective. The refined approach to stereo recovery will permit robust detection of optic disc stability or change, and it offers great promise for advancing optic nerve diagnosis in glaucoma.          n/a",Computer analysis of optic disc images in glaucoma,7494022,R01EY017299,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Calculi', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Compatible', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fundus', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Numbers', 'Optic Atrophy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recovery', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'day', 'digital imaging', 'image registration', 'improved', 'instrument', 'novel diagnostics', 'programs', 'stereoscopic', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2008,856688,593605914,0.15518319427093843
"Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma: Clinical Electrophysiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to investigate the diagnostic precision for detecting glaucoma of clinical electrophysiological measurement (pattern electroretinogram, PERG; and multifocal visual evoked potentials, mfVEP), a technique identified as an important recent glaucoma- related development in eye research by the 2004 National Eye Institute (NEI) National Plan. Aim 1: Electrophysiological responses will be characterized in glaucoma, suspect and healthy eyes and the diagnostic accuracy of these commercially available techniques will be compared to current reference standards (evaluation of stereoscopic photographs of the optic disc and standard automated perimetry) and to recently developed diagnostic techniques including optical imaging of the optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, optical coherence tomography, and scanning laser polarimetry) and visual function-specific perimetry (short-wavelength automated perimetry and frequency doubling technology perimetry). Aim 2: Novel use of machine learning classifier techniques (e.g. relevance vector machines, support vector machines, mixture of Gaussian techniques, independent components analysis) will be applied to electrophysiological data to improve its diagnostic accuracy and data from different diagnostic techniques (named above) will be combined to improve overall diagnostic accuracy. Aim 3: Electrophysiological measurements will be validated as functional indicators of optic nerve damage by examining the relationship between electrophysiological abnormality and optic disc and RNFL damage in glaucoma and glaucoma suspect patients. 210 patients (105 glaucoma's, 105 glaucoma suspects) and 105 healthy participants will be enrolled and studied cross-sectionally. The specific aims of this proposal address the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset, determining functional correlates of optic nerve damage, and characterizing glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. Information about the relative usefulness of electrophysiological measurement, optical imaging techniques, and ganglion cell-specific perimetry for glaucoma detection is important to the clinical community for determining future evidence-based changes in standard of care for glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. These studies will demonstrate the relative usefulness of electrophysiological measurement (pattern electroretinogram, PERG; multi-focal visual evoked potential, mfVEP) compared to optical imaging techniques (confocal scanning ophthalmoscopy, optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry) and ganglion cell-specific perimetry (short wavelength and frequency doubling perimetry) for glaucoma detection.

The glaucoma provider classifies tests as normal or indicative of glaucoma. The clinician then determines whether an eye has glaucoma or has had progression. Assembling these classifications, the provider makes decisions about management. Automated test interpreters, either as part of the testing machine or as a computer-based resource, can aid glaucoma providers with real-time interpretations. The research we propose takes advantage of our extensive data sets and builds on the ongoing research in our laboratories.Statistical classifiers, Bayesian nets, machine learning classifiers, and expert systems represent different types of classifiers with diverse properties. Machine learning classifiers can perform exceptionally well at identifying classes, even when the data are complex and have dependencies. We will test and select the optimal machine learning classifier for diagnosis. We will further improve classifier performance and determine feature utility by optimizing the feature set visual field tests are time consuming and stressful. We will streamline the tests by removing unimportant test points.Even with decades of experience, there is uncertainty with regard to the evaluation of the SAP. There is less accumulated knowledge about non-standard tests, such as short-wavelength automated perimetry, nerve fiber layer thickness, or optic nerve head topography. Machine classifiers may learn how to interpret nonstandard tests better. We will go beyond STATPAC's capabilities with classifiers that have learned to interpret SAP, nonstandard visual field tests, structural glaucoma tests, and STATPAC plots in the general population and in patients stratified by race, family history, and other information available at the time of the test.Conversion of suspects to glaucoma and progression of glaucoma cannot yet be predicted from tests. We will develop classifiers for these predictions. Classifiers will be designed to diagnose early glaucoma, detect early progression, and identify glaucomatous eyes at risk of progression.Unsupervised learning provides cluster analysis that can determine distinct groups with members in some way similar from the test data. In an effort to discover new and use useful information with unsupervised learning, we will mine our data in visual function and structural tests for glaucoma  and in specific combinations of population groups. n/a",Medical Advice from Glaucoma Informatics (MAGI),6551796,R21EY013928,"['clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' early diagnosis', ' eye disorder diagnosis', ' glaucoma', ' glaucoma test', ' human subject', ' neural information processing', ' neuropathology', ' visual fields']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO,R21,2002,144319,0,0.2849778879921214
