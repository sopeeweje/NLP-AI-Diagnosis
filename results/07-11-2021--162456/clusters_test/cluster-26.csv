"Focal nerve fiber layer reflectance analysis for glaucoma evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness, and effective glaucoma management requires early detection. Nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness measurement by optical coherence tomography (OCT) is useful for confirming the diagnosis of glaucoma, but its diagnostic sensitivity is not sufficient to be used alone for population-based screening.  NFL reflectivity is reduced in glaucoma subjects, presumably due to loss of axons and axonal microtubule content. But its diagnostic value is diminished by its dependence on the incident angle of the OCT beam, which is highly variable in routine clinical imaging. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy can be boosted by reducing incidence angle effects with azimuthal filtering of NFL reflectance profile, and by analysis of focal rather than average reflectance changes. The preliminary result, bases on 100 normal and glaucoma eyes, showed that the diagnostic sensitivity was significantly improved from 71% for average NFL thickness to 97% for focal NFL reflectance loss in PG eyes, at a 99% specificity cutoff. We propose to validate this result in the large Advanced Imaging for Glaucoma (AIG) study dataset that comprises 249 perimetric glaucoma (PG), 252 pre-perimetric glaucoma (PPG), and 145 normal participants. The AIG study has an average follow-up of more than 4 years, which also allows assessment of the accuracy in predicting glaucoma progression. 1. Reproduce the high diagnostic accuracy of focal NFL reflectance loss analysis using the large AIG  dataset. If we could again demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy in the AIG dataset, especially in the PPG  and early PG subgroups, this could bring OCT glaucoma evaluation into the realm of population screening.  The primary performance metric will be the diagnostic sensitivity at a fixed 99% specificity cut point. 2. Use focal NFL reflectance loss to predict visual field (VF) conversion and progression. In the AIG  study, focal thinning of the macular ganglion cell complex (GCC) and peripapillary nerve fiber layer (NFL)  were found to be the best predictors of VF conversion (development of glaucomatous VF abnormality in an  eye with normal baseline VF) and progression (significant worsening of VF). We hypothesize that focal  NFL reflectance loss would have even better predictive accuracy. Predictive accuracy will be assessed  using the area under the receiver operating curve (AROC) and logistic regression (odds ratio). 3. Combine OCT reflectance and structural maps using machine learning to improve glaucoma  diagnostic accuracy. A combination of disc, peripapillary, and macular thickness parameters had  previously been shown to be synergistic, producing higher AROC than any single parameter. We  hypothesize that the addition of the novel NFL reflectance loss map to the set of input parameters will  further enhance the diagnostic accuracy of a machine learning algorithm. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness using OCT is widely used in clinic for glaucoma diagnosis, but the diagnostic sensitivity is limited. Combination of NFL reflectivity and other structural OCT information promises to improve the diagnostic accuracy to a level where population-based screening would be feasible.",Focal nerve fiber layer reflectance analysis for glaucoma evaluation,10108277,R21EY032146,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Blindness', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Management', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Glaucoma', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microtubules', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Odds Ratio', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Retina', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Visual Fields', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macula', 'novel', 'population based', 'screening']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,192500
"Deep learning to quantify glaucomatous damage on fundus photographs for teleophthalmology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Atalie Carina Thompson, MD, MPH is a current glaucoma fellow and Heed fellow with a long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinician-scientist and leader in the field of glaucoma and public health. She has a long-standing interest in addressing healthcare disparities in medicine, and in improving the diagnosis of glaucoma and other ophthalmic diseases through imaging technology. While obtaining a medical degree at Stanford, she received a fellowship to complete a master’s degree in public health with additional higher-level coursework in biostatistics and epidemiology. Her immediate goal in this proposal is to refine and validate a deep learning (DL) algorithm capable of quantifying neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs and then to apply it in a pilot teleophthalmology program. With a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award, she will acquire additional didactic training and mentored research experience in glaucoma imaging, machine learning, biostatistics, clinical research, and the responsible conduct of research. Environment: The mentorship and expertise of the advisory committee, the extensive resources at the Duke Eye Center and Departments of Biostatistics and Biomedical Engineering, and the significant institutional commitment will provide her with the support needed to transition successfully into an independent clinician-scientist. Research: This proposal will test the hypothesis that a DL algorithm trained with SDOCT detects glaucoma on optic disc photographs with greater accuracy than human graders. In Specific Aim 1, a DL algorithm that quantifies neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs will be refined. The main hypothesis is that the quantitative output provided by the DL algorithm will allow accurate discrimination of eyes at different stages of the disease according to standard automated perimetry, and will generate cut-offs suitable for use in a screening setting. In Specific Aim 2, the short-term repeatability and reproducibility of the DL algorithm in optic disc photographs acquired over a time period of several weeks will be determined. The hypothesis is that the test-retest variability of the predictions from the DL algorithm will be similar to the original measurements acquired by SDOCT. In Specific Aim 3, the DL algorithm will be applied to optic disc photographs obtained during a pilot screening teleophthalmology program in primary care clinics and assisted living facilities. The hypothesis is that the DL algorithm will be more accurate than human graders when a full ophthalmic examination is used as the gold standard. This work will constitute the basis of an R01 grant and will advance our understanding of the application of deep learning algorithms in glaucoma and teleophthalmology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. However, since the disease can be asymptomatic until later stages, many patients with glaucoma will not know they have glaucoma until they suffer substantial and irreversible visual field loss. This study seeks to refine and validate a deep learning algorithm for early diagnosis of glaucoma on optic disc photographs and subsequently test it in a pilot teleophthalmology program.",Deep learning to quantify glaucomatous damage on fundus photographs for teleophthalmology,10105327,K23EY030897,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Nature', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Perimetry', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Suspect Glaucomas', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual impairment', 'Width', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'career', 'carina', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'experience', 'eye center', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'learning network', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health intervention', 'responsible research conduct', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'screening', 'tool']",NEI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,193774
"iGLAMOUR Study:  Innovations in Glaucoma Adherence and monitoring Of Under-Represented minorities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glaucoma affects more than 70 million people worldwide and is the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness. The only current method to delay its development and progression is by lowering intraocular pressure (IOP), achieved with topical administration of eyedrops. Adherence rates for glaucoma eyedrop administration are poor, in many cases below 50%, resulting in disease progression, eventual blindness, and a more than 2-fold increase in healthcare costs. African Americans and Latinos carry a significantly higher glaucoma burden compared with Caucasians. Minorities have additionally been found to have disproportionately lower rates of medication adherence. Previously studied interventions aimed at improving glaucoma adherence had key limitations that particularly affect minorities, including unreliable self-reported measures of adherence, lack of consideration of individual circumstances influencing glaucoma medication management, and developing/testing interventions in predominantly Caucasian populations. Health information technology has experienced rapid advancement in the last decade with the electronic health record (EHR), the proliferation of accessory mobile health technologies, and the advancement of artificial intelligence. Although their integration holds great promise to enable screening tools for diagnosis and risk prediction, successful integration to aid minority populations in real-world settings depends on: understanding how the collected information relates to the patient's other (e.g. clinical) data and the patient's socio-cultural context; seamless information exchange and interoperability with the EHR, the central portal of healthcare delivery; and integration of algorithmic findings into workflows involving both providers and patients to deliver information and/or recommendations in a simple, actionable manner. Glaucoma is a complex chronic disease, spanning decades of patients' lives and requiring ongoing monitoring and evaluation, thus making it an ideal application for the use of health IT to reduce racial disparities. In this proposal, we aim to accomplish this by: demonstrating the effectiveness of a flexible electronic eyedrop sensor to generate granular digital signatures of an individual's adherence and contextualizing this data in a socio- cultural context with patient interviews (Aim 1), combining adherence data with EHR variables to construct machine learning models to predict IOP control and enhance clinical risk stratification (Aim 2), and prototyping a dynamic dashboard for intervention coordination (Aim 3). Altogether, success of this innovative, comprehensive, culturally-tailored, and scalable health IT framework will improve medication adherence and slow disease progression among minorities, therefore narrowing this important racial health disparity. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans and Latinos carry a disproportionate burden of glaucoma, a blinding eye disease that can lead to severely decreased quality of life. Promoting adherence with topical medications that lower intraocular pressure, the primary therapeutic target for reducing the risk of glaucoma progression, represents a critical opportunity for technology-driven interventions. The iGLAMOUR (innovations in GLaucoma Adherence and Monitoring Of Under-Represented minorities) Study aims to develop and evaluate a health information technology framework incorporating flexible sensor electronics, machine learning-based predictive models, a patient- facing mobile interface, and a clinician-facing clinical dashboard to facilitate early identification and intervention for high-risk patients in order to narrow these racial disparities and improve vision outcomes in these minority populations.",iGLAMOUR Study:  Innovations in Glaucoma Adherence and monitoring Of Under-Represented minorities,10120501,R01MD014850,"['Adherence', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blindness', 'Bluetooth', 'Caucasians', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Eyedrops', 'Glaucoma', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medication Management', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Screening procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Topical application', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Wireless Technology', 'adherence rate', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'dashboard', 'data visualization', 'design', 'digital', 'dosage', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'glaucoma test', 'health care delivery', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'medication nonadherence', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'patient engagement', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'prototype', 'racial disparity', 'racial health disparity', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'social culture', 'social health determinants', 'success', 'support tools', 'therapeutic target']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,225000
"Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD), is a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for diagnosing PACD despite its limited ability to quantify disease severity, especially in patients with early angle closure. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a quantitative and objective imaging-based method for assessing the angle. However, there are limited methods for clinicians to apply AS-OCT to the care of angle closure patients. The primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of a quantitative anterior segment OCT-based approach to evaluating patients with PACD and develop classification models for PACD based on AS-OCT measurements; and 2) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the training and mentored research experience necessary to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these objectives will provide critical skills and experiences necessary to establish an independent research program focused on applying AS-OCT imaging to improve the clinical care of patients with PACD. The proposed K23 application will provide additional training in four vital areas: 1) epidemiology and mechanisms of chronic disease; 2) classification of disease and prediction of disease risk; 3) biostatistical methods for clinical research; 4) machine learning and automated data analysis. The proposed research will use population-based data collected as part of the NIH-funded Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) to compare AS-OCT and gonioscopic assessments of angle width and determine the strength of association between these assessments and known PACD risk factors. The relationship between the degree of angle closure, measured by AS-OCT, and intraocular pressure (IOP), a sequela of angle closure and strong risk factor for glaucoma, will be characterized with CHES data and validated with data obtained by using a novel pupil control system on PACD patients recruited from the USC Roski Eye Institute (USCREI). Classification models for PACD stage and severity based on AS-OCT data from CHES will be developed using machine learning algorithms and validated with prospective data from USCREI patients with PACD. The results of the proposed research will provide the foundation for a future longitudinal study examining the benefit of using anterior segment OCT-based assessments and classification models to evaluate PACD patients and deliver targeted treatment to patients with higher risk for PACG. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop quantitative imaging-based diagnostic and treatment protocols that guide the standardized care of PACD patients and decrease the incidence of PACG and its associated ocular morbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE The management of angle closure patients at risk for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD) and a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, poses a significant challenge for eye care providers. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for evaluating angle closure patients despite its limited ability to quantify PACD severity and predict progression to PACG.

"Relationship between Glaucoma and the Three-Dimensional Optic Nerve Head Related Structure Project Summary Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness globally, and is characterized by optic nerve damage that leads to the death of retinal ganglion cells with accompanying visual field (VF) loss. The optic nerve head (ONH) is the site of injury to the optic nerve fibers and plays a central role in glaucoma pathogenesis and diagnosis. Traditionally, glaucoma is diagnosed based on fundus inspection of the ONH, which provides information about the surface contour of the ONH. However, the optic nerve damage occurs in the deeper layers. With the development of optical coherence tomography (OCT) techniques for three-dimensional (3D) retinal imaging, parameters derived from the 3D ONH related structure (e.g., Bruch's membrane opening minimum rim width, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, disc tilt etc.) have been studied to better understand glaucoma pathogenesis, and are used to supplement clinical diagnosis. In addition, studies of the ONH biomechanics have also shown that the strain level at the ONH at any given intraocular pressure level depends on the 3D geometry of the ONH related structure. A high strain level is hypothesized to contribute to retinal ganglion cell injury. Previous research has suggested that the 3D ONH related structure is correlated to glaucoma pathogenesis and critically important to glaucoma diagnosis. However, to date, a systematic study using clinical data to determine the impact of the 3D ONH related structure on glaucoma has not been conducted.  We propose to study the relationship between the 3D ONH related structure and glaucoma with a diverse set of combined techniques including image processing, computational mechanics and machine learning. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Derive features from the 3D ONH related structure and study their implications on VF loss patterns (K99 Phase). (2) Investigate the impact of the strain field patterns at the ONH on glaucoma (K99 Phase). (3) Study the effect of the 3D ONH related features on OCT diagnostic parameters (R00 Phase). (4) Model central vision loss from the 3D ONH related structural features (R00 Phase). Collectively, these studies will provide new insights and perspectives into the structure-function relationships in glaucoma and establish ocular anatomy specific norms of retinal nerve fiber layer profiles, which will advance our current understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and improve glaucoma diagnosis. Our research is of high clinical relevance and can be potentially translated into clinical practice for better glaucoma diagnosis, monitoring and treatment.  Through the proposed research and training plans, the applicant will build a solid knowledge base in ophthalmology and further improve his expertise in mathematical modeling and data science. This project will provide critical training opportunities to further enhance the applicant's capabilities to become an independent computational vision scientist in ophthalmology.

"An enhancement to nGoggle: a VR Goggle for Structural and Functional assessment in Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY  Assessments of functional loss and of structural damage to the optic nerve are typical evaluations per- formed in the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma. This proposal aims at developing the hardware system that will allow acquisition of fundus photographs using the nGoggle, a portable Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) which integrates a wearable, wireless, electroencephalogram (EEG) system and a head-mounted display to monitor electrical brain activities associated with visual field stimulation. In a previous project, we developed the nGoggle portable system for the assessment of visual function deficits in order to address limitations of standard automated perimetry (SAP), a traditional but subjective visual field test. We compared the diagnostic accuracies of the nGoggle and SAP in discriminating patients with glaucoma from healthy subjects and found that the BCI performed at least as well, if not better than SAP, with the additional advantage of portability and objectivity.  With rapid advancements in smartphone cameras, it is now possible to develop compact auto-focusing fundus cameras and integrate them into our neuro-monitoring nGoggle. Recently we developed an approach named Machine-to-Machine (M2M), a deep learning algorithm that was trained to analyze fundus photos and predict quantitative measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and neuroretinal rim provided by spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SDOCT), with high correlation and agreement with the original SDOCT observations. This approach opens up the possibility of using simple fundus photographs to extract quantitative information about neural damage in glaucoma. By combining functional assessment currently provided by the nGoggle with structural assessment capability, this new system would result in a very unique device capable of portable structural and functional assessment of optic nerve damage for a multitude of eye conditions, not limited to glaucoma, such as age-related macular degeneration, retinal degenerations and non-glaucomatous optic neu- ropathies.  The specific aims of this Phase I SBIR project are (1) to incorporate a high-resolution auto-focusing fundus camera to the nGoggle head-mounted display in full compliance with ophthalmic instrument safety stand- ards and fundus camera functional standards, and (2) to demonstrate the ability of the nGoggle fundus camera to capture high-quality optical nerve images from a model eye. Successful development of this system will enable both structural and functional assessments of retinal conditions to be performed easily and inexpensively using a portable device. PROJECT NARRATIVE NGoggle Inc. proposes to develop a new wearable ophthalmic diagnostic instrument capable of performing con- current structural and functional assessment to diagnose and monitor optic neuropathies and retinal diseases. This project aims at developing a pair of compact high-resolution fundus cameras in full compliance with oph- thalmic instrument safety standards and integrating them into our neuro-monitoring nGoggle, an instrument with the demonstrated capability of estimating functional vision loss in glaucoma patients based on their electroen- cephalogram (EEG) responses evoked by visual stimuli. We also intend to demonstrate that the optic nerve images of model eyes taken by the integrated fundus cameras can yield consistent and compatible cup-to-disc ratios when compared with the measurements obtained from the same model eyes using optical coherence tomography (OCT). After successful demonstration, we plan to conduct clinical tests in the subsequent phase of this project.",An enhancement to nGoggle: a VR Goggle for Structural and Functional assessment in Glaucoma,10253661,R43EY032820,"['Address', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blindness', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Flare', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Glaucoma', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Light', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Nerve', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perimetry', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Safety', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual evoked cortical potential', 'Visual impairment', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'brain electrical activity', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'detection test', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'field study', 'functional loss', 'gaze', 'hazard', 'head mounted display', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'loss of function', 'neural network algorithm', 'optic nerve disorder', 'patient response', 'portability', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'screening', 'visual stimulus', 'wearable device']",NEI,"NGOGGLE, INC.",R43,2021,299600
"Deep Learning Approaches for Personalized Modeling and Forecasting of Glaucomatous Changes Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at managing the optimal care for individual cases due to difficulties of accurately assessing the potential progression and its speed and magnitude. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large inter-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we propose novel agnostic data-driven deep learning approaches to detect glaucoma and accurately forecast its progression that are optimized to each individual case. We will use state- of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. Instead of relying on the conventional knowledge-based approaches (e.g. quantifying tissues known to be significantly associated with glaucoma such as retinal nerve fiber layer), the proposed cutting-edge agnostic deep learning approaches determine the features responsible for future structural and functional changes out of thousands of features autonomously by learning from the provided large longitudinal dataset. This program will advance the use of structural and functional information obtained in the clinics with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma. Furthermore, the developed methods have potentials to be applied to various clinical applications beyond glaucoma and ophthalmology. Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies using agnostic deep learning approaches that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression forecasting and monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Deep Learning Approaches for Personalized Modeling and Forecasting of Glaucomatous Changes,10089451,R01EY030929,"['3-Dimensional', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Retina', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'analytical method', 'base', 'case-by-case basis', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'falls', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'ocular imaging', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'trend']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,376028
"Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma This project will use a combination of structural and functional measurements to test the hypothesis that early- stage damage in human glaucoma occurs first in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina – especially its OFF sub-lamina – as suggested by murine glaucoma models. In the first Aim, we will use a novel visible-light optical coherence tomograph (VIS OCT) to study structural changes in the retina of glaucoma patients. The newly developed VIS OCT has sufficient image contrast and resolution to segment the IPL boundaries and to define sub-lamination in volumetric OCT data, something not currently possible with existing near-infrared OCT instruments. We will make comparative measurements within the IPL and between the IPL, the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Because data from mouse models of glaucoma suggests that early damage occurs preferentially within the OFF sub-lamina of the IPL, we will make separate VIS OCT measurements biased for the OFF- and ON-sublaminae of the IPL and use machine learning approaches to determine whether a similar damage process can be demonstrated in human. To test whether OFF-pathway function is preferentially lost in glaucoma, we will use a novel Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) paradigm that employs sawtooth increments and decrements to bias the measurement to ON vs OFF pathways, respectively, a paradigm our data suggests discriminates glaucoma from control patients. The second Aim will optimize this SSVEP measurement for testing localized areas of the visual field. The third Aim will make comparative measurements of visual-field, VIS OCT and SSVEP loss patterns in a large sample of glaucoma patients and in age- and sex-matched controls. Thickness and interface reflectivity amplitude maps derived from VIS OCT imaging of the RNFL, GCL and IPL including sublaminae will be correlated topographically with visual field defects to assess the relative sensitivity of our structural biomarkers at and near visual field locations with demonstrable losses on conventional (Humphrey) perimetry. Similarly, SSVEP responses from different locations in the visual field will be correlated topographically with visual field loss patterns and to VIS OCT losses, with special emphasis on correlating structural damage in OFF vs ON sub-laminae of the IPL with the functional correlates derived from regional decremental and incremental SSVEPs. Separately and in combination, our structural and functional measurements are designed to provide strong tests of the biological hypothesis that the OFF pathway is preferentially damaged in human glaucoma, and to reveal new biomarkers for the disease. Improving visual outcomes in glaucoma will require a better understanding of the earliest sites and processes of damage and methods to measure them quickly and accurately in patients. This project will address both needs through a combination of novel Optical Coherence Tomography and electrophysiological measurements. The new imaging and electrophysiological tests that will be developed here, either separately or together, could eventually replace conventional visual field testing which is time-consuming and unreliable.",Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma,10150874,R01EY030361,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Noise', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perimetry', 'Process', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Rodent Model', 'Sampling', 'Scotoma', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual evoked cortical potential', 'base', 'cell injury', 'comparative', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'detection method', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'field study', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'sex']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,499625
