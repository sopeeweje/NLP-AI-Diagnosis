"Spectral precision imaging for early diagnosis of colorectal lesions with CT colonography Abstract Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, even though it could be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) could substantially increase the capacity, safety, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. However, the current standard of cathartic bowel preparation for CTC and optical colonoscopy (OC) is poorly tolerated by patients and has been recognized as a major barrier to colorectal examinations. Our advanced non-cathartic multi-center computer-assisted CTC trial showed that non-cathartic CTC is easily tolerated by patients and that radiologists who use computer-aided detection (CADe) can detect large polyps in size in non-cathartic CTC with high sensitivity, comparable to that of OC. However, SF6-lesions (serrated lesions, flat lesions <3 mm in height, and polyps 6 – 9 mm in size) were a significant source of false negatives in the trial. The challenges of detection and visualization of these SF6-lesions in non-cathartic CTC are caused largely by the inability of the current single-energy CTC technique to differentiate between soft tissues, fecal tagging, and their partial volumes with lumen air. We propose to employ multi-spectral CTC precision imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) to overcome these inherent limitations of non-cathartic CTC. Our goal in this project is to develop a novel deep-learning AI (DEEP-AI) scheme for multi-spectral multi-material (MUSMA) precision imaging, which will use deep super-learning of high-quality spectral CTC (spCTC) precision images to boost the diagnostic performance of non-cathartic CTC. We hypothesize that (1) high-quality MUSMA precision images can be reconstructed from ultra-low-dose (<1 mSv) spCTC scans, (2) DEEP-AI will yield a detection sensitivity for ≥6 mm SF6-lesions comparable to that of OC, and that (3) the use of DEEP-AI as first reader will significantly improve radiologists’ detection performance for SF6-lesions and reduce interpretation time compared with unaided reading, and that it will yield a detection accuracy comparable to that of OC. Our specific aims are (1) to establish a non-cathartic spCTC and MUSMA precision image database, (2) to develop a DEEP-AI Interpretation System for visualization and detection of SF6-lesions, and (3) to evaluate the clinical benefit of the DEEP-AI Interpretation System with non-cathartic spCTC cases. Successful development of the proposed DEEP-AI Interpretation System will substantially improve human readers’ performance in the detection of SF6-lesions from non-cathartic CTC examinations that address the problem of patient adherence to colorectal screening guidelines. Such a scheme will make non-cathartic CTC a highly accurate and acceptable screening option for large populations, leading to an increased colorectal screening rate, promoting early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reducing mortality due to colon cancer.

"A scalable non-intrusive image annotation method using eye tracking for training deep learning models in radiology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Machine learning (ML) and artiﬁcial intelligence have recently emerged as powerful techniques that can augment radiology interpretations and show promise for improving patient outcomes. One of the ways for ML to make a signiﬁcant impact on health care is in improving the evaluation of high-volume, low-cost exams for early signs of a wide variety of diseases.The routine chest x-ray is an ”opportunity for screening” for diseases, including cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia and congestive heart failure. For instance, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the US, and is typically diagnosed at a higher stage than most other cancers leading to low survival rates. The National Lung Screening Trial reported that low dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening resulted in a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality; however, few eli- gible people actually undergo LDCT screening. Meanwhile, chest x-rays continue to be the most common form of imaging worldwide. Improved detection from x-rays can direct patients to LDCT. COPD is another important disease that is often under-diagnosed. People with COPD are at increased risk of lung cancer and respiratory infections, or exacerbations, which are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, a chest x-ray may show poorly-deﬁned regions of consolidation that are concerning for pneumonia. Medical attention is re- quired to treat an infection or evaluate for other cause. More generally, methods to detect disease on chest x-rays can be extended to cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema and pleural effusions which are seen in congestive heart failure. Improved detection can direct patients to medical care. Convolutional neural networks (CNN), a highly successful ML model, can be applied to chest x-ray images. However, few annotated medical datasets exist that are sufﬁciently large to train CNNs. Furthermore, it has been shown that bounding boxes used to localize disease can be incorporated into the training of CNNs and signiﬁcantly increase their accuracy. Unfortunately, medical datasets with such localized annotations are even rarer and are very limited in the number of cases due to the time-consuming process of creating bounding boxes by radiologists. We propose an innovative integrated approach using eye tracking, speech recording and novel vision and language models to create localized annota- tions in a manner that is non-intrusive to the workﬂow of the radiologist. The novelty of our approach is in the use of eye tracking during routine radiological reading. The challenge is to overcome the relatively ambiguous nature of eye tracking information compared to bounding boxes which provide deﬁnitive information about abnormalities. To address this challenge, we will also design new CNN architectures and learning algorithms that can use eye tracking and additional information such as pupil dilation and ﬁxation duration. The proposed methodology can easily scale up to create very large datasets without generating additional workload for radiologists. Furthermore, deployed in the reading room, it could provide a continuous stream of annotated images to expand training sets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence hold the potential to improve patient outcomes by enhancing the eval- uation of low cost, routine chest x-rays for early imaging abnormalities associated with diseases such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia and making recommendations for follow-up care. To realize their full potential, machine learning algorithms require training on very large datasets with localized an- notations for abnormalities. We propose a novel data collection methodology using eye tracking that is scalable, non-intrusive to the workﬂow of the radiologist, and can generate very large datasets with localized annotations for the development of novel machine learning algorithms to address signiﬁcant medical problems.",A scalable non-intrusive image annotation method using eye tracking for training deep learning models in radiology,10133070,R21EB028367,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cardiomegaly', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Language', 'Localized Disease', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mydriasis', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Pleural effusion disorder', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Pupil', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Screening Result', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Workload', 'base', 'computed tomography screening', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data collection methodology', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical attention', 'model building', 'mortality', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'sample fixation', 'scale up', 'screening', 'visual tracking']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2021,152500,228951281
"Macro-vasculature: A Novel Image Biomarker of Lung Cance ABSTRACT  Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States and worldwide. The high mortality associated with lung cancer is in part due to underutilization of and limited access to lung cancer screening that impedes early diagnosis. The apprehension of some clinicians and policymakers towards lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) exams is based on concerns of lead-time bias and high false-positive rate. The development of a robust lung cancer biomarker that reduces screen-detected false positives and improves classification of indeterminate nodules would relieve some of the concerns related to lung cancer screening. Although investigations show that screening with LDCT scans may reduce lung cancer mortality by 20% compared to chest x-ray, it is reported that ~96% of suspicious findings (mostly indeterminate nodules) turn out to be non-cancerous (false positives). Clinical management of screen-detected indeterminate nodules often leads to unnecessary, costly, and potentially harmful follow-up procedures (e.g., follow-up CT scan, positron emission tomography (PET)/CT exam, invasive biopsies). We have developed an exciting and novel image-based macro-vasculature feature to discriminate benign from malignant nodules. We propose to further develop the feature and validate it across a range of CT protocols and scans from other institutions. We will also integrate the macro-vasculature features with clinical information (e.g., age, gender, smoking history, lung function) and evaluate the model's ability to discriminate benign from malignant screen-detected indeterminate nodules. We will investigate if a radiologist's classification of indeterminate nodules improves with the output of the integrative model compared to classification without the integrative model. The success of this project may lead to a novel and robust lung cancer biomarker to accurately assess screen-detected indeterminate nodules that can significantly reduce the number of unnecessary follow-up procedures during lung cancer screening. Project Narrative: We propose to investigate the role of the macro-vasculature surrounding indeterminate lung nodules depicted on CT images to discriminate screen-detected benign and malignant nodules. The goal is to improve lung cancer screening by reducing the number of unnecessary procedure associate the high rate of false positive detections.",Macro-vasculature: A Novel Image Biomarker of Lung Cance,10084850,R01CA237277,"['Administrator', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Colon', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nodule', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking History', 'Spiculate', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'chest computed tomography', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'demographics', 'density', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'longitudinal database', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'pulmonary function', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'spatial relationship', 'success', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,411709,570146095
"Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer Lung cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that more lung cancers can be detected at an early stage with low dose CT screening. However, over-diagnosis of indolent lung cancer and benign nodules is one of the major limitations of screening, resulting in unnecessary treatment, biopsy, follow-up, increased radiation exposure, patient anxiety, and cost. Due to a lack of in-depth knowledge of the correlation of structural image features and histologic findings of lung nodules and the absence of validated diagnostic biomarkers for accurate disease categorization, the current diagnosis and management of the screen-detected nodules remains challenging.  The goal of this proposed project is to develop a decision support system (DSS) based on quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) of pulmonary nodules using advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to characterize the histopathologic features of nodules and analyze their correlations with CT image features for improvement of early detection of lung cancer. We hypothesize that the proposed q-PCD analysis will have strong association with histopathologic characterization, and therefore will be a more effective biomarker for differentiation of invasive, pre-invasive, and benign nodules than conventional image-based features or radiologists' visual judgement. Accurate characterization of the nodule types will assist radiologists in making decision for management of the detected nodules; e.g., enabling early detection and treatment of invasive lung cancer, safe surveillance or replacing lobectomy with limited sublobar resection for pre-invasive lung cancer, and sparing biopsy of benign nodules, thereby reducing morbidity and costs in lung cancer screening programs. Our major specific aims are to 1) collect a large database of LDCT screening cases from NLST project and our institute to develop automated image analysis methods, 2) to develop a new DSS based on quantitative pathologic correlated CT descriptors (q-PCD) of lung nodules, 3) validate the effectiveness of DSS in lung cancer diagnosis. To achieve these aims, we will collect a large data set from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and our institute. The collected database will include the baseline and follow up scans, pathology data, demographic information and other information provided by NLST. We will develop automated segmentation methods to extract the volumes of the solid and sub-solid components of detected lung nodules, develop quantitative methods to characterize the radiologic and pathologic features of lung nodules as well as the surrounding lung parenchyma, develop a novel radiopathomics strategy to correlate pathomics with radiomics, and to identify new imaging biomarkers. We will develop a clinically-translatable DSS with a joint biomarker combining both image and patient information, and evaluate its performance in lung cancer diagnosis, including its effectiveness in baseline screening CT exams and in follow up exams. Narrative: Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in the United States. If successful, we will have developed an automated low dose CT-based quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) which can be included as an independent factor to improve the diagnosis of screening detected nodules. It will not only provide a useful imaging biomarker to assist in lung nodule management for individuals, but also constitute a strong foundation to meet our long-term goal of developing clinically- translatable decision support system (DSS) to facilitate personalized medicine in early detection of lung cancer, optimizing treatment strategies and reducing health care costs",Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer,10164728,U01CA216459,"['Advocate', 'Anxiety', 'Archives', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lobectomy', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nodule', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Screening Result', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'automated image analysis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinically translatable', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effectiveness validation', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'screening', 'screening program', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'unnecessary treatment']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2021,455832,641965656
"Individually-tailored clinical decision support for management of indeterminate pulmonary nodules ABSTRACT (PROJECT DESCRIPTION) The rollout of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening programs is accelerating in the United States, aiming for earlier detection of lung cancer to improve long-term survival. However, a consequence of such imaging programs is the increased discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs). Significant ques- tions remain around the effective management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs: while many are benign, a fraction will go on to become cancerous. Diagnostic models for IPNs and associated management guidelines have been described previously, but their real-world validation is limited. Moreover, the majority of models only use a “snapshot” of the IPN at a single point in time and fail to take into consideration progressive changes. Opportunities now exist to advance such predictive models by encompassing the patient's evolving medical history, combining clinical and imaging biomarkers to improve prediction and individually-tailor the management of IPNs over time. The objective of this imaging informatics proposal is the development of a clinical decision support tool for the management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs. We address two key challenges: 1) the development of a continuous-time model for predicting how the IPN will evolve; and 2) the use of this prediction to determine a series of actions over time that will optimize (screening) outcomes for the individual. We first explore the devel- opment of a continuous time belief network (CTBN), a temporal probabilistic model to predict the likelihood of a patient to develop lung cancer. Unlike traditional approaches, CTBNs do not require fixed sampling frequency of the data over time (e.g., all observations made annually) and are thus more amenable to real-world clinical settings and observational datasets. The probabilities computed through the CTBN are subsequently input into a partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to guide IPN management decisions. From the POMDP, policies (sequences of actions over time) can be chosen to achieve a desired goal (e.g., minimizing time to diagnosis), given past and current observations/decisions for an individual. For both the CTBN and POMDP, we explore novel methods in the design and implementation, overcoming computational challenges to realize translation of these models into practice. A web-based interface is implemented, providing a clinical de- cision making tool for physicians to understand the models' recommendations. Evaluation focuses on assessing the performance of the CTBN and POMDP relative to known outcomes and compared to other conventional methods (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, dynamic belief networks); as well as the overall impact of the system to influence decision-making. This effort advances our past research in probabilistic models and capital- izes on expertise in lung cancer screening, including past leadership of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). The result of this effort will be a set of informatics-driven modeling tools and new temporal predictive models informing IPN management. PROGRAM NARRATIVE Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening is being implemented nationwide, aiming to reduce mortality due to lung cancer. But questions have been raised regarding false positives, with concerns about the attendant discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) and their ensuing long-term surveillance.

"Rapid Comprehensive Cardiac MRI Exam for Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. The clinical gold standards to diagnose and guide treatment of patients with CAD are based on invasive catheter-based procedures, such as x-ray coronary angiography (XCA) for anatomic assessment or fractional flow reserve (FFR) for physiologic assessment. However, there are costs and risks associated with such invasive procedures. Such concerns are further highlighted by the fact that large studies have shown nearly two-thirds of patients referred for their initial elective invasive XCA were found to have no significant stenoses. Thus, better non-invasive diagnostic tools are needed. Cardiac MRI (CMR) is the only non-invasive imaging modality that provides a comprehensive assessment of CAD in a single examination, including an assessment of myocardial perfusion, cardiac function and viability, as well as angiographic evaluation of stenoses, without requiring ionizing radiation. These properties also allow for repeat testing as may be clinically indicated. However, despite its great potential to serve as the non- invasive gatekeeper for costly invasive procedures, lengthy examination times have prevented CMR from clinical translation. Although several accelerated imaging techniques have been proposed, these still require trade-offs between coverage, resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. In this proposal, we will develop and validate novel acquisition and reconstruction strategies to enable a highly accelerated high-resolution whole heart CMR exam for comprehensive CAD assessment in under 10 minutes. We will develop fast and low specific absorption rate outer volume suppression modules to reduce the source of aliasing artifacts from the chest and the back. This will enable higher rates for simultaneous multi-slice imaging in perfusion and cine CMR, improving coverage substantially with minimal noise amplification. For coronary MRI and viability imaging, simultaneous multi-slab imaging will be introduced to CMR, facilitating high isotropic resolution acquisitions with fast coverage. These acquisitions will be supplemented with regularized leakage-blocking and patient- specific machine learning reconstructions for further artifact and noise removal. Finally, we will implement and validate the proposed rapid comprehensive CMR exam in a cohort of suspected CAD patients, comparing our approach with conventional clinical CMR for the assessment of function, perfusion, and viability, and with invasive XCA for the assessment of coronary stenosis. Successful completion of this project has the potential to transform CMR into a leading rapid non-invasive tool for safe and accurate diagnosis of CAD, improving the healthcare of several million patients with chest pain and other CAD symptoms annually. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for one in six deaths. Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive non-ionizing technique for comprehensive evaluation of CAD, but its clinical translation is hampered by lengthy exam times.

"Lung Screening: Efficacy versus Effectiveness In 2011, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) reported a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality for participants screened with low-dose CT (LDCT) as opposed to chest X-ray. Based largely on these findings, LDCT lung screening is now a covered service for 8.7 million high-risk current and former smokers in the United States. For high-risk individuals younger than 65, insurance coverage is mandated under the Affordable Care Act; for those 65 and over screening is covered by Medicare. Medicare covers lung screening only if patients are enrolled in a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-approved lung screening registry. The American College of Radiology Lung Cancer Screening Registry (ACR-LCSR) is the only registry currently approved by CMS. Although most medical societies have endorsed CT for lung cancer screening, the American Academy of Family Physicians concluded that the evidence was insufficient to recommend either for or against lung screening, as the results of the NLST had not been replicated in a community setting. Concerns regarding the dissemination of lung screening focus on 1) the high rate of false positive (FP) screens, for which participants receive a positive screening result and require additional testing, but do not have lung cancer, 2) the relatively high rate of potentially clinically important significant incidental findings (SIFs) detected at lung screening that are unrelated to lung cancer, and 3) potential harms from the diagnostic evaluation of these FP and SIF abnormalities. It is unclear whether the rate of FPs and SIFs seen in the NLST, will be replicated in community practice, as opposed to a clinical trial setting. Higher rates of FPs and SIFs in the community or inefficient diagnostic evaluation may result in delayed cancer diagnosis, excessive testing, iatrogenic complications due to unnecessary testing, or decreased cost-effectiveness of lung screening in the community, as opposed to the NLST. For the proposed research, we plan to: 1) compare the rate and type of abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer and the rate and type of SIFs in the ACR-LCSR community registry data as opposed to the NLST, 2) compare the diagnostic pathways used to assess these abnormalities in the community as opposed to the NLST, and 3) use a decision-tree cost-effectiveness analysis to compare community lung screening with NLST cost-effectiveness assumptions with respect to rates of lung and SIF abnormalities and diagnostic pathways; and to identify most cost-effective diagnostic pathways for each type of abnormality. This information is of vital importance to ensure that the reduction in lung cancer mortality reported by the NLST is achieved in the community setting. The goal of this project is to compare the efficacy of lung screening in community practice with that reported in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) with respect to the rate and type of abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer, the rate and type of significant incidental findings that are seen on lung screening and may be clinically important, but that are not related to lung cancer, and the diagnostic testing that is done to evaluate lung and other abnormalities. We will use this information to compare the cost effectiveness of community lung screening with that estimated from the NLST and provide information that can be used to enhance the effectiveness of lung screening in the community.",Lung Screening: Efficacy versus Effectiveness,10165656,R01CA215240,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affordable Care Act', 'American', 'American College of Radiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Community Practice', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family Physicians', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Nodule', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Policy Maker', 'Preventive service', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening Result', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'community setting', 'comparative cost effectiveness', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data registry', 'former smoker', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'patient screening', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'tv watching']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,509518,127562714
"Comprehensive characterization of coronary atherosclerotic disease using photon-counting-detector dual-source CT and its impact on patient management PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Cardiac CT provides fast non-invasive assessment of CAD with a high sensitivity and negative predictive value – provided that the lumen can be visualized. However, heavily calcified or stented coronary segments are non- assessable, precluding non-invasive diagnosis of flow-limiting coronary plaques in an estimated 2 million U.S. adults. In addition, the spatial resolution of state-of-the-art CT systems is insufficient for robust visualization of features associated with high risk plaques. Further, while CT can quantitatively evaluate the impact of obstructive CAD on myocardial function using dynamic perfusion imaging, this requires relatively high patient radiation doses, which has limited widespread adoption. Considering the high personal and societal cost of CAD, robust, accurate, non-invasive imaging of calcified and stented coronary arteries, high-risk plaque features, and myocardial perfusion defects in a single, low-radiation-dose exam is critically needed. Built by Siemens Healthcare, a first-of-its-kind, whole-body, photon-counting-detector (PCD) CT system was installed in 2014 at the Mayo Clinic. With support from NIH award EB016966, we showed that the increased iodine contrast-to-noise ratio, decreased electronic noise, spectral imaging capabilities, and improved spatial resolution of PCD-CT relative to commercial CT enabled us to accurately measure increased vasa vasorum density in injured swine carotid arterial walls, demonstrating the exceptional potential of PCD-CT in vascular imaging. Because this system lacks cardiac imaging capabilities, our objective is to develop and validate a PCD dual-source (DS) CT system and novel imaging algorithms to accurately assess CAD in humans, especially in patients with heavily calcified, stented, or high-risk plaques, and to identify patients with myocardial perfusion defects. Our premise is that the established benefits of PCD-CT, used with a DS geometry and advanced noise reduction and material decomposition algorithms, can meet these objectives. Our proposal is significant in many ways: the technology developments will benefit all of CT imaging; robust, accurate, non-invasive imaging of calcified and stented coronary arteries, high-risk plaque features, and myocardial perfusion defects in a single, low-radiation-dose exam will obviate the need for additional imaging, reducing the overall time and cost to comprehensively evaluate CAD and its clinical significance. To extend the demonstrated benefits of PCDs to cardiac CT will require numerous physics, engineering, and algorithm innovations, including novel noise reduction and material decomposition algorithms using energy, spatial and temporal domain redundancies, as well as deep learning. These advances will culminate in a large clinical study to demonstrate not merely that the images are “better,” as is so often done, but that PCD-DSCT provides clinically-significant improvements in the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected CAD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a new type of cardiac computed tomography (CT) scanner that is able to comprehensively assess coronary artery disease in humans. This technology, known as photon-counting- detector dual-source CT, is capable of exceptional spatial and temporal resolution, multi-energy spectral imaging and reduced radiation doses, allowing it to image the coronary artery and myocardium with unparalleled quality. This will enable comprehensive assessment of coronary artery anatomy and myocardial function from a single imaging exam, reducing time to diagnosis and cost, while also improving patient diagnosis and management.",Comprehensive characterization of coronary atherosclerotic disease using photon-counting-detector dual-source CT and its impact on patient management,10150846,R01EB028590,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Defect', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Equipment', 'Family suidae', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Iodine', 'Lesion', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stents', 'Sudden Death', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm development', 'calcification', 'clinically significant', 'coronary plaque', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'photon-counting detector', 'routine practice', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'societal costs', 'spectral energy', 'spectrograph', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'vasa vasorum']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,657862,276703803
"Novel Integrative Approach for the Early Detection of Lung Cancer using Repeated Measures PROJECT SUMMARY Early detection of lung cancer among asymptomatic individuals is a priority for reducing mortality of the number one cancer killer worldwide. Most lung cancers are first detected as indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs). While the vast majority of IPNs are benign, those malignant ones present with specific features that should allow for the early discrimination and intervention. We have recently completed a study demonstrating the value of structural imaging features analysis in providing improved accuracy in detection of cancers among IPNs with accuracy of over 90% trained in the NLST and validated in two independent cohorts. The AUC increased from baseline risk estimate of disease using clinical parameters (Mayo model) 0.78 to 0.84 and from 0.82 to 0.92 in two independent validation cohorts. Similarly, we tested the added value of our high sensitivity hsCYFRA 21-1 assay in three populations of lung nodules and obtained similar added value to the MAYO model. Finally, we identified signatures predictive of lung cancer using large scale data mining in the electronic health record (EHR). The performance of the performance of the established imaging predictor, hsCYFRA concentrations and EHR trajectories will be validated in a prospective cohort. In an innovative partnership between pulmonary oncology, radiology, machine learning, and data science experts at Vanderbilt, we propose to integrate the layer of clinical information accessible in the EHR to improve the noninvasive diagnosis accuracy. In addition, we propose to take advantage of repeated measures to improve the accuracy of the prediction of cancer and to reduce the time to diagnosis. We therefore propose the following aims. In Aim 1 we will validate advanced quantitative imaging analyses to distinguish early benign from malignant IPNs based on repeated measures of 1000 individuals. In Aim 2. We will test in 150 individuals with lung nodules the added value of repeated measures of hsCYFRA 21- 1 protein blood biomarker in diagnostic accuracy over the baseline concentrations of the biomarker. In Aim 3 we will test a deep learning strategy from the EHR of 20,000 patients from VUMC to identify patterns likely to improve the early detection of lung cancer, and in Aim 4 we will test the added value of monitoring changes in levels of the markers for early detection using repeated pre-diagnosis chest CT studies, serum analysis of hsCYFRA 21- 1, and EHR patterns from our lung cancer screening program. Built upon strong preliminary data and unique resources from VUMC that include access to large imaging and HER data sources this novel integrative study has the potential to generate highly impactful and translatable results to reduce false positive rates among IPNs, and morbidity and mortality from lung cancer. This application responds to PAR 19-264 using low-dose lung screening computed tomography longitudinal analysis integrated with a lead serum biomarker and the power of artificial intelligence to mine the EHR for the discovery of a novel integrative strategy for the early detection of premetastatic lung cancer. NARRATIVE Most lung cancers present as pulmonary nodules; so, to improve survival from lung cancer, we need to identify with noninvasive strategies the disease early among a majority of benign nodules. This project focuses on establishing an integrative approach to early detection leveraging repeated measures of chest CT imaging features of lung nodules over time, of the rate of change of a high sensitivity blood biomarker hsCYFRA 21-1, and of longitudinal clinical patterns from the electronic health record. This research will inform the management of lung nodules identified on lung cancer screening CT scans, and should reduce the time to diagnosis and the mortality of lung cancer.",Novel Integrative Approach for the Early Detection of Lung Cancer using Repeated Measures,10069919,R01CA253923,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Proteins', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Markers', 'Community Hospitals', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nodule', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Radiation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Study of serum', 'Testing', 'Thoracotomy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biological specimen archives', 'biomedical informatics', 'blood-based biomarker', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computed tomography screening', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early detection biomarkers', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'machine learning method', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'premalignant', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'rate of change', 'research clinical testing', 'screening program', 'serial imaging']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,682056,377931988
