"COMPREHENDING SENTENCES WITH LONG-DISTANCE DEPENDENCIES To understand the sentence ""Who did the girl the teacher forced to talk complain to?""  One must determine that ""the girl"" is to be taken as the missing subject of the verb ""talk"" and that ""who"" is the missing object of the preposition ""to.""  Sentences with such long-distance dependencies as that between ""the girl"" and the subject position preceding ""to talk"" pose special problems for theories of sentence comprehension.  They challenge the apparent human limits on short-term memory and processing capacity, in that arbitrary amounts of linguistic material can intervene between the items that are dependent upon each other and any one sentence can contain several long-distance dependencies.  Further, they are subject to unique linguistic constraints that a language user must honor.  We propose experiments to study the comprehension of sentences with long-distance dependencies, using reaction time and other measures of processing difficulty. Our goals are to determine what decision principles people follow in understanding such sentences, to identify the various types of information (lexical, pragmatic, suprasegmental, grammatical constraints) they use in making decisions about long-distance dependencies, and to specify the sequence in which they use functionally different types of information.

"QUANTITATIVE GAIT ANALYSIS Quantitative gait analysis using computer aided videomotion analysis, force plates and electromyography is of recognized value in assessment of gait disabilities and in quantitative evaluation of treatment.  But, despite dramatic improvements in techniques, gait analysis still lacks widespread clinical utility because of uncertainties relating to data selection, manipulation, and analysis.  Since data acquisition is usually limited to a single test session over several gait cycles, one vital problem concerns selection of a gait cycle for analysis that is representative of the patient's gait and determination of its reliability as a basis for clinical decision making.  Another problem relates to the manipulation of large quantities of data generated by measurements of various kinetic, kinematic and electromyographic parameters over several gait cycles to detect clinically significant patterns of performance.  This process is further complicated by the fact that gait patterns vary among patients with the same syndorme and to a certain extent, vary even among normals. Interpretration may be simplified by using statistical pattern recognition techniques, but for a pattern recognition approach to be successful, the enormous quantity of data must be reduced to a parsimonious set of features which describe gait patterns accurately.  Furthermore, representation of graphic patterns associated with various gait parameters in terms of a discrete set of variables would make numerical comparison more meaningful.  The first part of this study will investigate repeatability and clinical reliability of selected kinetic, kinematic and electromyographic parameters obtained from repeated gait analyses on normal subjects and two representative groups of orthopaedic patients, using a statistical criterion (variance ratio).  The feasibility of using the variance ratio as a criterion for averaging gait cycles to yield a representative cycle also will be examined.  The second part of the study will deal with the application of principal component analysis for representing gait patterns in a concise manner, as an initial step to application of pattern recognition techniques.  The effectiveness of the derived features in representing gait abnormalities will be evaluated using the same normal and orthopaedic patient subjects.  It is anticipated that the results of the proposed study will enhance the clinical effectiveness of quantitative gait analysis by defining practical computer algorithms for selecting and assessing reliability of raw gait data, and by defining techniques for feature selection that can be used effectively in pattern recognition techniques.

"CLINICAL DECISION SYSTEMS RESEARCH RESOURCE Attention and effort on this computer program for consultative diagnosis in medicine have been focused during the past year on two areas primarily, (a) the development of the new CADUCEUS program, and (b) the expansion and updating of the medical knowledge base. Prototypic computer programs have been written for the operation of CADUCEUS and have been preliminarily tested.  A substantial portion of the medical knowledge base (diseases of the liver and biliary tract) has been reorganized in the CADUCEUS format.  The installation of a dedicated VAX computer this summer will allow these programs to be tested critically and then further work can proceed on both elements. The knowledge base in internal medicine has been expanded so that it now includes over 500 diseases and some 3,450 individual manifestations of disease. Many disease entities which were programmed some years ago have been updated. It is gratifying but not unexpected that this expansion and updating have improved the performance of INTERNIST-I.  The pediatrics knowledge base has been significantly expanded also.  Considerable progress has been made on an anatomy knowledge base for utilization in CADUCEUS.  Progress has also been made on the reorganization of the diagnostic program to a form utilizable for educational and testing purposes by medical students and physicians.  Future work will proceed along all of these lines with emphasis on the organization and refinement of the CADUCEUS diagnostic program.

"CLINICAL DECISION SYSTEMS RESEARCH RESOURCE A new diagnostic procedure for CADUCEUS has been developed, which we believe provides a framework for solving all of the known problems encountered in our use of INTERNIST-1.  During the five year period covered by the current proposal, we intend to pursue the following specific aims:  Revision of the structure of the CADUCEUS knowledge base will be undertaken to support the enhanced capabilities of the new diagnostic procedure.  The revised knowledge base will be expanded to encompass all of the major diseases of internal medicine, and much of neurology.  Evaluation of the new CADUCEUS system will be undertaken in two phases. First, through protocol analytic studies, we intend to study and refine the human/machine interface of CADUCEUS, exploring specifically various modes of cooperative human/machine problem solving.  Subsequently, we plan to carry out formal evaluation studies of the system in order to gauge its diagnostic accuracy, the value of its information gathering and explanatory capability, and its acceptability to a variety of potential client groups.  The overall objective for this five year effort will be to bring CADUCEUS to a state of maturity that will permit its distribution for general use by medical practitioners.
