"SCH: INT: Computational Tools for Avoidaint/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder  Intellectual Merit: This project will for the first time provide the fundamental tools to integrate unique multimodal data toward screening, diagnosis, and intervention in eating disorders, with an initial focus on children with ARFID and related developmental and health disorders. This work is critical for enriching the understanding of healthy development and for broadening the foundations of behavioral data science. ARFID ·motivates the development of new computer vision and data analysis tools critical for the analysis of multidimensional behavioral data. The main aims are: 1. Develop and user individualized and integrated continuous facial affect coding from videos to discern affective motivations for food avoidance, critical due to the unique sensory aspects of eating disorders, and resulting from active stimulation via friendly and carefully designed images/videos and real food presentation; 2. Use data analysis and machine learning to derive sensory profiles based on patterns of food consumption and preference from existing unique datasets of selective eaters; and 3. Translate the tools developed in Aims 1 and 2 into the clinic and home to assess the capacity of these tools to define a threshold of clinically significant food avoidance, to detect change in acceptability of food with repeated presentations, and to examine and modify the accuracy of our food suggestion algorithms. Broader Impacts: The impact of this application comprises two broad domains. First is the derivation of processes, tools, and strategies to analyze very disparate data across multiple levels of analysis and to codify those strategies to inform similar future work, in particular incorporating automatic behavioral coding. Second is the exploitation of these tools to address questions about the emergence of healthy/unhealthy food selectivity across the lifespan, including recommendation delivery via apps and at-home recordings. The health impact of even partial success in this project is very broad and significant. Undergraduate students will be involved in this project via the 6-weeks summer research program at the Information Initiative at Duke, a center dedicated to the fundamentals of data science and its applications; via the co-Pl's research lab devoted to eating disorders; and via the Pl's project dedicated to training undergraduate students to address eating disorders of their friends via an anonymous app. Outreach and dissemination will follow the broad use of the developed app, both in the clinic and the general population, including the Pl's connections with low-income and under-represented bi-lingual preK. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Eating disorders are potentially life-threatening mental illnesses affecting the general population; -90% of individuals never receive treatment, in part due to lack of awareness and access. Individuals with eating disorders experience a diminished quality of life, high mental and physical illness comorbidities, and an existence marked by profound loneliness and isolation. Combining expertise in eating disorders with computer vision and machine learning, we bring for the first time data science to this health challenge.

"Cancer Prevention through Dietary Change: Training in translational neuroimaging PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Unhealthy eating increases the risk of developing several kinds of cancer. This occurs directly through consumption of carcinogenic food, and indirectly through overweight and obesity. Because nearly 70% of American adults are overweight or obese, it is critical to develop effective interventions to alter eating behavior. One key factor that influences eating behavior and weight gain is cue-induced food craving. Craving stimulates appetitive motivation to eat, but can be regulated via cognitive strategies such as reappraisal, or the reconstrual of a stimulus to change its affective meaning. Reappraisal increases the salience of consumption- related costs and reduces food craving for unhealthy food. Craving reappraisal is therefore a promising target for interventions designed to reduce unhealthy eating and risk for diet-related cancers. However, individual differences in treatment efficacy remain a persistent problem with interventions. To understand why an intervention works for some individuals and not for others requires clearly defined neurobiological mechanisms of change, as well as sensitive and specific tools to evaluate individual differences in psychological targets. To fill this gap, the goal of this project is to leverage machine learning and multivariate neuroimaging methods to develop and validate a sensitive and specific neural signature of craving reappraisal that can be used as a neurobiological index of craving reappraisal ability. To achieve this goal, this project will pursue the following Aims: 1) develop and validate a neural signature of craving reappraisal in an independent sample of existing data, and 2) establish the predictive and incremental validity the neural signature in the context of an ongoing randomized control trial of cognitive reappraisal training to reduce unhealthy eating in overweight and obese adults. Specifically, after development, I will test the construct validity of the neural signature by assessing whether expression of the signature is greater while participants reappraise their desire for craved food than while they simply view these foods (Aim 1). I will also test the predictive and incremental validity of the neural signature by assessing the extent to which individual differences the neural signature change predict intervention outcomes, such as the value of unhealthy food and eating behavior, above and beyond standard methods (Aim 2). Upon completion of this project, I will have developed and validated a sensitive and specific neurobiological index of craving reappraisal ability that can be readily used by other researchers to evaluate intervention efficacy and individual differences in responsivity to treatment. I will also receive in-depth training in translational neuroscience interventions for cancer control, and multivariate neuroimaging and machine learning. This work will facilitate the refinement of reappraisal-based interventions to reduce unhealthy eating that will ultimately reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity and risk for diet-related cancers. Further, by documenting my analysis process and sharing my analysis code, the results of this work can readily be adopted by others to study a variety of psychological processes relevant to eating behavior and cancer risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive reappraisal can be used to reduce food craving and unhealthy eating (a key risk factor for several kinds of cancer), but interventions to train reappraisal ability are not equally effective for all individuals. This project aims to leverage multivariate neuroimaging and machine learning techniques to develop an objective, neurobiological index of craving reappraisal ability that can be used to assess individual differences in treatment responsivity. The knowledge and research training gained from this project will prepare the trainee to build and refine interventions to reduce unhealthy eating that will ultimately reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity, and risk for diet-related cancers.",Cancer Prevention through Dietary Change: Training in translational neuroimaging,9756118,F31CA232357,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'Health Promotion', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'adult obesity', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenicity', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'control trial', 'cost', 'craving', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'food craving', 'increased appetite', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'open source', 'parent grant', 'post intervention', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2019,39535,0.14829698969872457
"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers. There are programs to reduce intake of these foods and weight loss, but the effects of the programs rarely last. This project tests whether altering the value of cancer-risk foods can create lasting change, and uses neuroimaging to compare the efficacy of two programs to engage the valuation system on a neural level. Results will establish the pathways through which the programs work and suggest specific treatments for individuals based on a personalized profile.",Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience,9751223,R01CA211224,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Calories', 'Cancer Control', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Food', 'Food Habits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Food', 'High-Risk Cancer', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated cancer', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Work', 'active control', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral response', 'cancer risk', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cognitive training', 'common treatment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental arm', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sugar', 'theories', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect', 'weight loss program', 'willingness to pay']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2019,571889,0.3352434207043485
"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,9675217,U01AI131344,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Age-Months', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eczema', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Feces', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Home environment', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Mennonite', 'Milk', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neonatal', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Secretory Immunoglobulin A', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Systems Development', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vaginal delivery procedure', 'animal data', 'atopy', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'early onset', 'food allergen', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'infancy', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microorganism antigen', 'mucosal site', 'neonate', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'response']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,U01,2019,452545,0.17287986734668598
"2020 Nanoscale Science and Engineering for Agriculture and Food Systems Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar Project Summary The objectives of this GRC are: 1) To bring together experts and stakeholders to discuss nanotechnology advances, directions, and needs in food and agriculture; 2) To identify cutting-edge research and emerging opportunities to address global challenges of food security, environmental sustainability, food safety, and agricultural productivity. A major goal of this GRC is to promote exceptional early career and female investigators, as well as those of traditionally underrepresented populations, to ensure the continued growth in diversity of scholars in our vibrant community. A diverse range of invited speakers and discussion leaders will present a comprehensive vision of critical and emerging nanotechnology research advances across the field of agricultural science. The program illustrates a targeted excellent diversity of leadership (6), speakers (23), and discussion leaders (11) across the spectrum of: i) gender diversity (19 females, 21 males); ii) USA (24) /International participation (16), representing Austria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Germany, India, Italy, Korea, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, and Taiwan; and iii) industry and government (3), which includes the FDA, FAO, a founder of a blockchain startup company, and senior research scientist at a non-governmental organization. The following topics will be included in the program: Food and nutrition, bioinspired and targeted technologies, sensing and tracking, microbiomes, food contact materials and human health and disease. Discussions on the safe deployment of nanotechnology in these areas, public perception and policy, and influence on industry and entrepreneurship are integral to this GRC. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), the FDA center responsible for protecting the health of US consumers, will find the following sessions of great interest, Convergence of Nanotechnology with Food & Agriculture; Advances in Nanomaterials; Environmental Nanotechnology; Nano-enabled Approaches to Improving Human & Animal Health; Translation of Nano-Based Science for Application in Food & Agriculture; Big Data, Machine Learning, AI & Modeling; and Nanotechnology's Impact on Food Safety. The significant contributions of this diverse population will provide the strong intellectual infrastructure required to develop safe and sustainable nano-enabled applications in food and agriculture in direct support of the FDA CFSAN goal of ensuring the safety, security, sanitation, and proper labeling of the U.S. food supply. Project Narrative Nanomaterials and nanotechnology are rapidly entering almost every industry around the world. The co-chairs of this GRC envision that the convergence between nanotechnology, biotechnology and information science within plant science, animal science, crop and food science/technology and environmental science will lead to revolutionary advances in improving public health. The successful achievement of this lofty vision requires the profound intellectual commitment of scientists and engineers in a highly integrated engagement across numerous disciplines. Some success examples with a focus on nanotechnology in food include: nano- biosensors for identification of pathogens, toxins and bacteria in foods; identification systems for tracking animal and plant materials from origination to consumption; development of nanotechnology-based foods with lower calories and with less fat, salt and sugar, while retaining flavor and texture; integrated systems for sensing, monitoring and active response intervention for plant and animal production; “smart field systems” to detect, locate, report and direct application of water; precision and controlled release of fertilizers and pesticides; development of plants that exhibit drought resistance and tolerance to salt and excess moisture; and nanoscale films for food packaging and contact materials that extend shelf life, retain quality, and reduce cooling requirements. Overall, nanoscale science and engineering has an important role in creating a safer and more productive agriculture and food system. Commercial advances and technological impacts have been limited somewhat due to the relative “newness” of nanotechnology in agriculture and food systems. Given that research at the nanoscale in agriculture and food systems is only into its second decade, safety of nano-enabled applications in agriculture are still up for debate. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), the FDA center responsible for protecting the health of US consumers, will find the following sessions of great interest, Convergence of Nanotechnology with Food & Agriculture; Advances in Nanomaterials; Environmental Nanotechnology; Nano-enabled Approaches to Improving Human & Animal Health; Translation of Nano-Based Science for Application in Food & Agriculture; Big Data, Machine Learning, AI & Modeling; and Nanotechnology's Impact on Food Safety. In the spirit of the GRC mission, the 2020 Nano Ag & Food GRC and GRS will again bring together a diverse array of scientists and engineers, both senior and junior, postdocs, and graduate students from academia, as well as scientists and engineers from business, government, and Non-governmental organizations (NGOs); with an emphasis to attract researchers from around the world to engage in open scientific exchange.

"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers.

"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema.

"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers. There are programs to reduce intake of these foods and weight loss, but the effects of the programs rarely last. This project tests whether altering the value of cancer-risk foods can create lasting change, and uses neuroimaging to compare the efficacy of two programs to engage the valuation system on a neural level.

"Mobile Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognize (FIVR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Inadequate dietary intake assessment tools hamper studying relationships between diet and disease. Methods suitable for use in large epidemiologic studies (e.g., dietary recall, food diaries, and food frequency questionnaires) are subject to considerable inaccuracy, and more accurate methods (e.g., metabolic ward studies, doubly-labeled water) are prohibitively costly and/or labor-intensive for use in population-based studies. A simple, inexpensive and convenient, yet valid, dietary measurement tool is needed to provide more accurate determination of dietary intake in populations. We therefore propose a three-phase project to develop and test a new assessment tool called FIVR (Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognizer) that uses a novel combination of innovative technologies: advanced voice recognition, visualization techniques, and adaptive user modeling in an electronic system to automatically record and evaluate food intake. FIVR uses cell phones to capture both voice recordings and photographs of dietary intake in real-time. These dual sources of data are sent to a database server for recognition processing for real-time food recognition and portion size measurement through speech recognition and image analysis. The user model will allow for enhanced identification of food and method of preparation in situations that images alone might not produce accurate results as the system learns through experience and adapts to the individual's food patterns. Objectives are to fuse existing voice and image recognition techniques into a system that will recognize foods by food type and unique characteristics and determine volume by film clip showing an image from at least two angles. The item identified will be matched to an appropriate food item and amount within a food composition database and nutrient intake computed. Researchers will be able to view the resulting analysis through an adapted version of the dietary analysis program, ProNutra. The proposed protocol will incorporate three discrete phases: 1) technology development, integration, and testing; 2) validity testing with a controlled diet (metabolic ward study); and 3) real-world utility testing. Validity of the data collected will be judged by how closely the nutrient calculations match the known composition of the metabolic ward diets consumed.

"Mobile Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognize (FIVR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Inadequate dietary intake assessment tools hamper studying relationships between diet and disease. Methods suitable for use in large epidemiologic studies (e.g., dietary recall, food diaries, and food frequency questionnaires) are subject to considerable inaccuracy, and more accurate methods (e.g., metabolic ward studies, doubly-labeled water) are prohibitively costly and/or labor-intensive for use in population-based studies. A simple, inexpensive and convenient, yet valid, dietary measurement tool is needed to provide more accurate determination of dietary intake in populations. We therefore propose a three-phase project to develop and test a new assessment tool called FIVR (Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognizer) that uses a novel combination of innovative technologies: advanced voice recognition, visualization techniques, and adaptive user modeling in an electronic system to automatically record and evaluate food intake. FIVR uses cell phones to capture both voice recordings and photographs of dietary intake in real-time. These dual sources of data are sent to a database server for recognition processing for real-time food recognition and portion size measurement through speech recognition and image analysis. The user model will allow for enhanced identification of food and method of preparation in situations that images alone might not produce accurate results as the system learns through experience and adapts to the individual's food patterns. Objectives are to fuse existing voice and image recognition techniques into a system that will recognize foods by food type and unique characteristics and determine volume by film clip showing an image from at least two angles.

"Computer Vision Methods for the Real Time Assessment of Dietary Intake    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a leading cause of preventable death and disability in the U.S. Self- monitoring of all foods and beverages consumed is central to weight loss and maintenance efforts; however, this places a heavy burden on the user. These same burdens also impede nutritional research. The proposed research is for the testing of a semi-automated, objective, near real-time computer vision and pattern recognition approach to the measurement of dietary intake. In the proposed product, cell phone pictures of meals and snacks will be analyzed by software in an attempt to automatically recognize as many items as possible. A small number of intelligent yes/no questions will help provide additional information when necessary in order to meet the accuracy demands of the target application. Following identification of the items, the software will estimate the portion sizes of all identified items. The experiments comprising this Phase I SBIR are (a) extract the most informative sets of features using a large number of food and beverage items taken from an existing database of real world meal images, (b) compare the accuracy of candidate pattern recognition approaches to identify items based on the extracted features, (c) identify the most feasible algorithms for estimating portion size, and (d) test usability and user acceptance with a simulated version of the product. Phase II will (a) apply the approach to a greater variety of food and beverage items, (b) improve automated analysis, and (c) compare the approach to existing assessment instruments. This research will extend defense- and security-related technologies to the assessment and treatment of obesity.          n/a",Computer Vision Methods for the Real Time Assessment of Dietary Intake,7405586,R43CA124265,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calculi', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Class', 'Coin', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Diabetic Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Food', 'Food and Beverages', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Intake', 'Iris', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marketing', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Numbers', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritionist', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated disease', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Placement', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Simulate', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Wing', 'base', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'disability', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'obesity treatment', 'research study', 'size', 'usability']",NCI,"MEDIABALANCE, INC.",R43,2007,191710,0.12120713299894927

"Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The prevalence of obesity in developed countries is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity contributes to an increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and some cancers and is now considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The objective of this research is to investigate application of novel noninvasive devices and pattern recognition methods to perform studies of human food intake behavior and produce objective estimates of volumetric and caloric food intake that will be relevant for identifying effective measures to treat or prevent diseases like obesity. Such devices and methods could extend our understanding of causes of obesity, and the monitoring devices created in this study could be used for monitoring of obese patients and as a part of a therapy potentially improve quality of life and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity. The goal of this study is to design and perform a pilot investigation which will provide preliminary data that objective observations of mastication (chewing) and deglutition (swallowing) by a wearable, non-intrusive monitoring device can provide statistically reliable estimates of eating habits by providing objective measures of delution frequency, duration of mastication and identifying periods of food intake with sufficient sensitivity and specificity.  The aims of the proposed research include design of the wearable sensors and associated signal processing methods; development of pattern recognition methodologies that will automatically detect instances of delution and mastication from sensor recordings; development of pattern recognition methods to automatically identify periods of food intake based on detected chewing and swallowing; and to validate these device and methodologies on a group of human subjects.

The aims of the proposed research include design of the wearable sensors and associated signal processing methods; development of pattern recognition methodologies that will automatically detect instances of delution and mastication from sensor recordings; development of pattern recognition methods to automatically identify periods of food intake based on detected chewing and swallowing; and to validate these device and methodologies on a group of human subjects. Modern methods of computational intelligence such as artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic will be used along with statistical methods to achieve the highest 'accuracy of pattern recognition. n/a",Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake,7022662,R21HL083052,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavior test', 'bioenergetics', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical automation', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biosensor device', 'biotechnology', 'caloric dietary content', 'calorimetry', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'human morbidity', 'human subject', 'mastication', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nutrient intake activity', 'nutrition related tag', 'obesity', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'quality of life', 'statistics /biometry', 'swallowing']",NHLBI,CLARKSON UNIVERSITY,R21,2005,217756,0.15146035422021337
"LiFESim: Software for health science education (NCRR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stottler Henke Associates in collaboration with Teachers College, Columbia University, proposes to build a software system for teaching scientific inquiry in the context of nutrition science, The goal of the proposed research is to develop a computer based instructional system - called LiFESim - that teaches accurate and detailed information about food and the food system -- from production of food on the farm through food processing and transportation, to impacts of food on personal health and on the natural environment in terms of waste and pollution. The software will complement an existing health science curriculum, developed at Teachers College for 4th-6th graders, called ""Linking Food and the Environment"" or LIFE, developed from an NIH Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA) RR 12374 (1997-2004). Our system will be based on the paradigm of role-playing simulation used in such popular computer games as SimCity and The Sims: students using the software assume roles in a simulated environment and learn from the consequences of the decisions that they make in those roles. Using the simulation paradigm students will be able to explore the dynamics of large-scale systems, such as those the food transportation system in ways that are not possible with the existing curriculum. For example, the simulation would allow students to explore the impact of changes in transportation patterns on food delivery. Our system will provide explicit coaching in applying scientific methods for investigation. We will also explore learning strategies that will encourage students to critically examine - and hopefully improve - their dietary choices. We will complement simulation-based learning with two other artificial intelligence based methodologies - the use of lifelike pedagogical agents, and the use of case-based reasoning. During Phase I, we will develop a set of detailed instructional goals, use these to develop an initial system design, develop a limited prototype of the system, and then develop and perform an informal pilot study to evaluate the viability of our design. The pilot study will be conducted over a one-month period at schools in Hayward, California and New York City. Our Phase II effort will focus on developing an extensive design and performing detailed use testing of the system developed during Phase I.         n/a",LiFESim: Software for health science education (NCRR),6790401,R43RR019780,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'environmental contamination', 'food', 'food processing /preparation', 'health education', 'human subject', 'interactive multimedia', 'nutrition', 'nutrition related tag', 'science education']",NCRR,"STOTTLER HENKE ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2004,100000,0.2239568106118468
"AC/DC: Artificial intelligence and Computer visioning to assess Dietary Composition ABSTRACT Dietary intake is a complex human behavior that drives disease risk and corresponding economic and healthcare burdens worldwide. Poor diet is the leading cause of death in the US and a known driver of obesity – a global epidemic. A major contributor to poor diet is food eaten away from home, such as restaurant foods. Research has shown that tracking one’s weight and dietary intake significantly improve success toward weight loss and maintenance goals; however, this type of tracking is burdensome, prone to error, and difficult to estimate for restaurant foods. Accurate approaches and tools to evaluate food and nutrient intake are essential in monitoring the nutritional status of individuals. There is a critical need for real-time data capture that minimizes burden and reduces error. While progress has been made, there is no tool available that accurately and automatically estimates foods left unconsumed in a meal. Two major limitations of existing systems is the reliance of a fiducial marker for food detection and volume estimation, and reliance on humans – either the respondent or a trained researcher – to estimate the portion of food leftover. This application leverages novel technology to remove those limitations. The long-term research goal is to utilize digital imaging (DI), artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) techniques to develop a novel hybrid methodology for rapid, accurate measurement of dietary intake. To attain this goal, our objective in this R21 application is to refine and test a system architecture that (a) uses digital images to record dietary intake in real-time and (b) uses AI and CV techniques to identify food/beverage items and determine amounts leftover. We plan to build on our current prototype in which digital food images are captured before and after the meal, analyzed to detect the food items, a three-dimensional (3-D) virtual model constructed, and volume remaining after the meal estimated, which will be used to calculate the amount leftover based on the initial volume. Volume consumed will be converted to weight and linked to public-use nutrition information. These calorie estimates will be compared against calories those from (a) DIs coded by trained research staff and (b) weighed plate waste methodology. Our expectation is to develop a valid system architecture for rapidly estimating dietary intake. The outcome of this proposal is expected to have a significant positive impact, enabling nutrition and health researchers to collect high-quality food consumption data in real world settings, increasing knowledge of dietary patterns and improving capacity to assess dietary interventions. This work will lead to an R01 application that will expand food types and meal settings and test the utility of our system among consumers. Project Narrative Solutions to address the global obesity epidemic are urgently needed. Research has shown that tracking one’s weight and dietary intake significantly improve success toward weight loss and maintenance goals; however, this type of tracking is burdensome, prone to error, and difficult to estimate for restaurant foods, a known driver of obesity. This study integrates nutrition science, computer science, and engineering to develop and test a new method for assessing dietary intake, and if successful would yield a rapid, reliable, accurate and cost- effective tool.",AC/DC: Artificial intelligence and Computer visioning to assess Dietary Composition,9978495,R21CA250024,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Beverages', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Economics', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional Science', 'Nutritional status', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Respondent', 'Restaurants', 'Side', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'disorder risk', 'expectation', 'food consumption', 'food quality', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'new technology', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'prototype', 'success', 'system architecture', 'tool', 'virtual model', 'wasting', 'weight maintenance']",NCI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON,R21,2020,222002,0.2684673222844807

"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers. There are programs to reduce intake of these foods and weight loss, but the effects of the programs rarely last. This project tests whether altering the value of cancer-risk foods can create lasting change, and uses neuroimaging to compare the efficacy of two programs to engage the valuation system on a neural level. Results will establish the pathways through which the programs work and suggest specific treatments for individuals based on a personalized profile.",Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience,9988193,R01CA211224,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Calories', 'Cancer Control', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Food', 'Food Habits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Food', 'High-Risk Cancer', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated cancer', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Work', 'active control', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral response', 'cancer risk', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cognitive training', 'common treatment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental arm', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sugar', 'theories', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect', 'weight loss program', 'willingness to pay']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2020,771233,0.3352434207043485
"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,9895622,U01AI131344,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Age-Months', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eczema', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Feces', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Home environment', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Measures', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Mennonite', 'Milk', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neonatal', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Secretory Immunoglobulin A', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Systems Development', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vaginal delivery procedure', 'animal data', 'atopy', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'early onset', 'food allergen', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'infancy', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microorganism antigen', 'mucosal site', 'neonate', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'response', 'support vector machine']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,U01,2020,449434,0.17287986734668598
