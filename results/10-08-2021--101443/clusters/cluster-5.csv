"Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing Project Summary Automatic extraction of useful information from clinical texts enables new clinical research tasks and new technologies at the point of care. The natural language processing (NLP) systems that perform this extraction rely on supervised machine learning. The learning process uses manually labeled datasets that are limited in size and scope, and as a result, applying NLP systems to unseen datasets often results in severely degraded performance. Obtaining larger and broader datasets is unlikely due to the expense of the manual labeling process and the difficulty of sharing text data between multiple different institutions. Therefore, this project develops unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms to adapt NLP systems to new data. Domain adaptation describes the process of adapting a machine learning system to new data sources. The proposed methods are unsupervised in that they do not require manual labels for the new data. This project has three aims. The first aim makes use of multiple existing datasets for the same task to study the differences in domains, and uses this information to develop new domain adaptation algorithms. Evaluation uses standard machine learning metrics, and analysis of performance is tightly bounded by strong baselines from below and realistic upper bounds, both based on theoretical research on machine learning generalization. The second aim develops open source software tools to simplify the process of incorporating domain adaptation into clinical text processing workflows. This software will have input interfaces to connect to methods developed in Aim 1 and output interfaces to connect with Apache cTAKES, a widely used open- source NLP tool. Aim 3 tests these methods in an end-to-end use case, adverse drug event (ADE) extraction on a dataset of pediatric pulmonary hypertension notes. ADE extraction relies on multiple NLP systems, so this use case is able to show how broad improvements to NLP methods can improve downstream methods. This aim also creates new manual labels for the dataset for an end-to-end evaluation that directly measures how improvements to the NLP systems lead to improvement in ADE extraction. Project Narrative Software systems that use machine learning to understand clinical text often suffer severe performance loss when they are applied to new data that looks different than the data that they originally learned from. In this project, we develop and implement methods that allow these systems to automatically adapt to the characteristics of a new data source. We evaluate these methods on the clinical research task of adverse drug event detection, which relies on many different variables found in the text of electronic health records.",Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing,9768545,R01LM012918,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Apache', 'Area', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Human', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Network-based', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'case finding', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'method development', 'natural language', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'news', 'novel', 'open source', 'point of care', 'side effect', 'social media', 'software systems', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tumor', 'unsupervised learning']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,383874,0.02066145513950768
"Leveraging Unlabeled and Pseudo Data for Clinical Information Extraction Project Summary/Abstract Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain significant information that can benefit many downstream uses. However, most of this information is in unstructured narrative form and is inaccessible to computerized methods that rely on structured representations for exploring, retrieving, and presenting the information. Natural language processing (NLP) and information extraction (IE) open this trove of information to studies that would otherwise be without. Over the past decades, many IE systems have been developed. These systems have typically focused on one task at a time. In addition, most have studied only specific types of records, e.g., discharge summaries, and addressed their task on data from a single institution. Performances achieved by the state-of-the-art IE systems developed under these conditions ranged from 44% F-measure to 99% F-measure. This observed variation can be attributed to the nature of the tasks: some target entities like dates tend to be better represented in the data and also more rigidly stick to known patterns of expression as opposed to reasons for medication administration which are relatively sparse in the data and can show wider linguistic diversity. However, this may not be the only reason: the data used can also explain the performance variation. Narratives of EHRs vary in their style, format, and content going from one department to another, from one hospital to another. Even the same record type in two different hospitals can be very different in narrative style and pose different challenges for IE. Understanding IE performance therefore requires studies of multiple tasks on multiple record types that come from multiple institutions. One major bottleneck for evaluation of IE systems on such a large scale is annotation. The same bottleneck also limits system development. This proposal aims to address this bottleneck for both evaluation and development. It first generates a multi-institution corpus consisting of multiple record types from five institutions. It studies four different IE tasks that broadly represent IE in clinical records and can inform the field of IE as a whole: de-identification, clinical concept extraction, medication extraction, and adverse drug event extraction. Within the context of these IE tasks, the proposal then puts forward methods that learn from unlabeled or pseudo data that can help alleviate reliance on annotated data for development. It evaluates these methods both for performance and generalizability on multiple types of records from multiple institutions. As a result of these activities, this proposal generates de-identified data, annotations, methods, software, and machine learning models which it then makes available to the research community. Project Narrative Information extraction (IE) systems, i.e., natural language processing (NLP) systems that enable creation of accurate semantic representations of narratives, rely heavily on the availability of gold standard annotated corpora and vary significantly in their performance from task to task, and from data set to data set. We propose methods that augment gold standard data with unlabeled data that are more easily available, and pseudo data which can be derived from gold standard data. We study IE within the context of four tasks and evaluate IE systems enhanced with unlabeled and pseudo data for generalizability on a heterogeneous data set consisting of multiple record types from five institutions.",Leveraging Unlabeled and Pseudo Data for Clinical Information Extraction,9813134,R15LM013209,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adverse drug event', 'Affect', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Social Work', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Task Performances', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Washington', 'computerized', 'deep learning', 'dosage', 'field study', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'medication administration', 'novel', 'open source', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NLM,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,414798,0.027822648055695905
"Resource Curation and Evaluation for EHR Note Comprehension Title: Resource Curation and Evaluation for EHR Note Comprehension The American Diabetes Association estimates that over 25.8 million Americans have diabetes.

"Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records ABSTRACT: There are nearly 7,000 diseases that have a prevalence of only one in 2,000 individuals or less. Yet, such rare diseases are estimated to collectively affect over 300 million people worldwide, representing a significant healthcare concern. Although rare diseases have predominantly genetic origins, nearly half of them do not manifest symptoms until adulthood and frequently confound discovery and diagnosis. Even in the case of early onset disorders, the sheer number of possible diagnoses can often overwhelm clinicians. As a result, rare diseases are often diagnosed with delay, misdiagnosed or even remain undiagnosed, not only disrupting patient lives but also hindering progress on our understanding of such diseases. Data science methods that mine large-scale retrospective health record data for phenotypic information will aid in timely and accurate diagnoses of rare diseases, especially when combined with additional data types, thus, having significant real- world impact. This proposal will integrate electronic health record (EHR) data sets with publicly available vocabularies and ontologies, and genomic data for the improved identification and characterization of patients with rare diseases, using approaches from machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and basic bioinformatics. The work has three specific aims and will be carried out in two phases. During the mentored phase, the principal investigator (PI) will develop data-driven methods to extract standardized concepts related to rare diseases from clinical notes and infer the occurrence of each disease (Aim 1). He will also develop data science approaches to compare and contrast longitudinal patterns associated with patients' journeys through the healthcare system when seeking a diagnosis for a rare disease, and aid in clinical decision-making by leveraging these patterns (Aim 2). During the independent phase (Aim 3), computational methods will be developed for the integrated modeling and analysis of genotypic (from Aim 3) and phenotypic information (from Aims 1 and 2). Cohorts to be sequenced will cover diseases for which causal genes or disease definitions are unclear (discovery), as well as those for which these are well known (validation). This work will be carried out under the mentorship of four faculty members with complementary expertise in biomedical informatics, data science, NLP, and rare disease genomics at the University of Washington, the largest medical system in the Pacific Northwest (four million EHRs), world-renowned researchers in medical genetics, and a robust data science environment. In addition, under the direction of the mentoring team, the PI will complete advanced coursework, receive training in translational bioinformatics and clinical research informatics, submit manuscripts, and seek an independent research position. This proposal will yield preliminary results for subsequent studies on data-driven phenotyping and enable the realization of the PI's career goals by providing him with the necessary training to build on his machine learning and basic bioinformatics expertise to transition into an independent investigator in biomedical data science. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare genetic diseases are estimated to affect the lives of 25 to 30 million Americans and their families, and present a significant economic burden on the healthcare system. Currently, our knowledge of the broad spectrum of the 7,000 observed rare diseases is limited to a few well-studied ones, hindering our ability to make correct and timely diagnoses. The objective of this study is to improve the identification of patients with rare diseases in healthcare systems by developing data science approaches that automatically recognize rare disease-related patterns in patient health records and correlate them with genomic data, thus, aiding in diagnosis and discovery.",Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records,9645433,K99LM012992,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Markov Chains', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Washington', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'causal variant', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease phenotype', 'early onset disorder', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'member', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'rare condition', 'rare genetic disorder', 'recruit', 'skills', 'software development', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2019,92070,0.0024875880799837867
"Automated Knowledge Engineering Methods to Improve Consumers' Comprehension of their Health Records PROJECT SUMMARY  Today, more patients can access their health records online than ever before. However, clinical acronyms hinder patients' comprehension of their records and decrease the benefits of transparency. An automated system for expanding clinical acronyms should have major clinical significance and far-reaching consequences for improving patient-provider communication, shared decision-making, and health outcomes. Existing systems have limited power to expand clinical acronyms, primarily due to the lack of comprehensiveness (or generali- zability) of existing acronym sense inventories. Because developing comprehensive sense inventories is difficult, existing knowledge engineering methods have primarily focused on developing institution-specific sense inventories. Institution-specific sense inventories may not be generalizable to other geographical regions and medical specialties. Furthermore, developing an institution-specific sense inventory at every US healthcare organization is not feasible, especially without automated methods which currently do not exist.  I developed advanced knowledge engineering methods to overcome these limitations through the use of fully automated techniques to generalize existing sense inventories from different geographical regions and medical specialties. My methods leverage the extensive resources already devoted to developing institution- specific sense inventories in the U.S., and may help generalize existing sense inventories to institutions without the resources to develop them. Although promising, challenges remain with the optimization and evaluation of these methods. The objective of the proposed project is to use knowledge engineering to improve patients' comprehension of their health records, focusing specifically on clinical acronyms. In Aim 1, I will develop new knowledge engineering methods to facilitate the automated integration of sense inventories, using literature- based quality heuristics and a Siamese neural network to establish synonymy. I will evaluate these methods using multiple metrics to assess redundancy, quality, and coverage in two test corpora with over 17 million clinical notes. In Aim 2, I will evaluate whether the knowledge engineering methods improve comprehension of doctors' notes in 60 hospitalized patients with advanced heart failure. With success, I will create novel, automated knowledge engineering methods that can be directly applied to improve patient care. This research is in support of my mentored doctoral training at Columbia University Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) under Drs. David Vawdrey, George Hripcsak, Carol Friedman, Suzanne Bakken, and Chunhua Weng, and will include coursework on deep learning, oral presentations at major annual conferences, and career development planning, among other activities. DBMI is frequently recognized as one of the oldest and best programs of its kind in the world, and provides an exception training environment for my development into an independent and productive academic investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical acronyms make it difficult for patients to understand their medical records, decreasing the benefits of transparency. This project applies advanced knowledge engineering methods and machine learning to generate comprehensive acronym sense inventories used to aid consumers' comprehension of their health records.

"Open Health Natural Language Processing Collaboratory Project Summary One of the major barriers in leveraging Electronic Health Record (EHR) data for clinical and translational science is the prevalent use of unstructured or semi-structured clinical narratives for documenting clinical information. Natural Language Processing (NLP), which extracts structured information from narratives, has received great attention and has played a critical role in enabling secondary use of EHRs for clinical and translational research. As demonstrated by large scale efforts such as ACT (Accrual of patients for Clinical Trials), eMERGE, and PCORnet, using EHR data for research rests on the capabilities of a robust data and informatics infrastructure that allows the structuring of clinical narratives and supports the extraction of clinical information for downstream applications. Current successful NLP use cases often require a strong informatics team (with NLP experts) to work with clinicians to supply their domain knowledge and build customized NLP engines iteratively. This requires close collaboration between NLP experts and clinicians, not feasible at institutions with limited informatics support. Additionally, the usability, portability, and generalizability of the NLP systems are still limited, partially due to the lack of access to EHRs across institutions to train the systems. The limited availability of EHR data limits the training available to improve the workforce competence in clinical NLP. We aim to address the above challenges by extending our existing collaboration among multiple CTSA hubs on open health natural language processing (OHNLP) to share distributional information of NLP artifacts (i.e., words, n-grams, phrases, sentences, concept mentions, concepts, and text segments) acquired from real EHRs across multiple institutions. We will leverage the advanced privacy-preserving computing infrastructure of iDASH (integrating Data for Analysis, Anonymization, and SHaring) for privacy- preserving data analysis models and will partner with diverse communities including Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), PCORnet, and Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) to demonstrate the utility of NLP for translational research. This CTSA innovation award RFA provides us with a unique opportunity to address the challenges faced with clinical NLP and through strong partnership with multiple research communities and leadership roles of the research team in clinical NLP, we envision that the successful delivery of this project will broaden the utilization of clinical NLP across the research community. There are four aims planned: i) obtain PHI-suppressed NLP artifacts with retained distribution information across multiple institutions and assess the privacy risk of accessing PHI- suppressed artifacts, ii) generate a synthetic text corpus for exploratory analysis of clinical narratives and assess its utility in NLP tasks leveraging various NLP challenges, iii) develop privacy-preserving computational phenotyping models empowered with NLP, and iv) partner with diverse communities to demonstrate the utility of our project for translational research.

"Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data SUMMARY The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic health records (EHR) that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of patients throughout the country. The observational data emerging from these systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the effectiveness of existing and novel treatments, and to monitor potential safety issues that may arise when interventions are used in broad patient populations. However, observational clinical data have exposures that are driven by many factors and therefore aggressive adjustment is needed to remove as much confounding bias as possible in order to make attribution regarding select exposures. The field of machine learning provides a powerful collection of data-driven approaches for performing flexible, thorough confounding adjustment, but performing reliable statistical inference is particularly challenging when these techniques are used as part of the analytic strategy. We propose to advance reproducible research methods by developing and illustrating novel targeted learning tools that leverage the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect and characterize health effect signals using large-scale EHR data. Specifically, we will first develop techniques for making efficient, statistically valid and robust inference for treatment effects using state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We will also develop online learning techniques to make such inference in the context of streaming EHR data. Methodological advances will enable us to formulate a formal, rigorous and practical framework for conducting continuous, effective and reliable surveillance for safety endpoints. Finally, we will develop statistical approaches for incorporating prior information -- including demographic, epidemiologic or pharmacodynamic knowledge, for example -- to improve health effect estimation and inference when the health outcome of interest is rare and the statistical problem is thus difficult, as often occurs in safety surveillance. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to enable biomedical researchers and public health regulators to carefully monitor and protect the health of the public by allowing them to more effectively and more reliably detect critical health effect signals that may be contained in population-scale EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic medical records that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of U.S. subjects. The population scale of contemporary health care data is opening new opportunities for quickly learning from observational data, and is now supporting on-going national surveillance that will monitor the risks and benefits of both existing and novel treatment paths. The objective of this proposal is to provide an inferential framework that leverages the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect health effect signals, including in the important setting of high-dimensional confounders and/or rare events, and to develop a real-time sequential updating methodology for safety signal detection.",Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data,9816009,R01HL137808,"['Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative treatment', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'national surveillance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'risk minimization', 'software development', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,502815,0.016156354737762415
"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management.

"National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2): Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives Project Summary and Abstract Narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) contain useful information that is difficult to automatically extract, index, search, or interpret. Natural language processing (NLP) technologies can extract this information and convert it in to a structured format that is more readily accessible by computerized systems. However, the development of NLP systems is contingent on access to relevant data and EHRs are notoriously difficult to obtain because of privacy reasons. Despite the recent efforts to de-identify and release narrative EHRs for research, these data are still very rare. As a result, clinical NLP, as a field has lagged behind. To address this problem, since 2006, we organized thirteen shared tasks, accompanied with workshops and journal publications. Twelve of these shared tasks have focused on the development of clinical NLP systems and the remaining one on the usability of these systems. We have covered both depth and breadth in terms of shared tasks, preparing tasks that study cutting-edge NLP problems on a variety of EHR data from multiple institutions. Our shared tasks are the longest running series of clinical NLP shared tasks, with ever growing EHR data sets, tasks, and participation. Our most popular three data sets have been cited 495 (2010 data), 284 (2006 de-id data), and 274 (2009 data) times, respectively, representing hundreds of articles that have come out of these three data sets alone. Our goal in this proposal is to continue the efforts we started in 2006 under i2b2 shared task challenges (i2b2, NIH NLM U54LM008748, PI: Kohane and R13 LM011411, PI: Uzuner) to de-identify EHRs, annotate them with gold- standard annotations for clinical NLP tasks, and release them to the research community for the development and head-to-head comparison of clinical NLP systems, for the advancement of the state of the art. Continuing our efforts under National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) based at the Health Data Science program of the newly established Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, we aim to form partnerships with the community to grow the shared task efforts in several ways: (1) grow the available de-identified EHR data sets through partnerships that can contribute to the volume and variety of the data, and (2) grow the available gold-standard annotations in terms of depth and breadth of NLP tasks. Given these aims and partnerships, we plan to hold a series of shared tasks. We will complement these shared tasks with workshops that meet in conjunction with the Fall Symposium of the American Medical Informatics Association and with journal special issues so that advancement of the state of the art can be sped up and future generations can build on the past. Project Narrative We propose to organize a series of shared tasks, workshops, and journal publications for fostering the continuous development of clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies that can extract information from narratives of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Our aim is to grow the annotated gold standard EHR data sets that are available to the research community through partnerships and to bring together clinical NLP researchers with informatics researchers for building collaborations. We will engage the community in shared tasks and disseminate the knowledge generated by these shared tasks through workshops and journal special issues for the advancement of the state of the art.",National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2): Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives,9759499,R13LM013127,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'American', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Future Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Israel', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Privacy', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Series', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Targeted Research', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical development', 'computerized', 'falls', 'head-to-head comparison', 'health data', 'indexing', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'practical application', 'programs', 'symposium', 'usability', 'working group']",NLM,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,R13,2019,20000,0.049855709937103206
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes.

"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes innovative intelligent biomedical natural language process approaches to detect ADEs in patients' electronic health records (EHRs), an important step towards ADE surveillance and pharmacovigilance. The focus of this proposal will bon the national priority area of anticoagulants ADE detection, although the algorithms and systems we develop can be extended to other drug classes and diseases. It is anticipated that the data resources, algorithms, and the Anticoagulant Pharmacovigilance Toolkit (APVTK) developed will significantly enhance ADE detection, patient surveillance and post marketing pharmacovigilance.",EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance,9628032,R01HL125089,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulant therapy', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Illinois', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Outcomes Research', 'Package Insert', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Reaction', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Safety', 'Schedule', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'data resource', 'disorder prevention', 'dosage', 'epidemiology study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'pharmacovigilance', 'predictive modeling', 'primary endpoint', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2019,809552,0.028167712403170106
"Extended Methods and Software Development for Health NLP PROJECT SUMMARY There is a deluge of health-related texts in many genres, from the clinical narrative to newswire and social media. These texts are diverse in content, format, and style, and yet they represent complementary facets of biomedical and health knowledge. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to extract, understand, and distill valuable information from these overwhelming large and complex streams of data, with the ultimate goal to advance biomedicine and impact the health and wellbeing of patients. There have been a number of success stories in various biomedical NLP applications, but the NLP methods investigated are usually tailored to one specific phenotype and one institution, thus reducing portability and scalability. Moreover, while there has been much work in the processing of clinical texts, other genres of health texts, like narratives and posts authored by health consumers and patients, are lacking solutions to marshal and make sense of the health information they contain. Robust NLP solutions that answer the needs of biomedicine and health in general have not been fully investigated yet. A unified, data-science approach to health NLP enables the exploration of methods and solutions unprecedented up to now.  Our vision is to unravel the information buried in the health narratives by advancing text-processing methods in a unified way across all the genres of texts. The crosscutting theme is the investigation of methods for health NLP (hNLP) made possible by big data, fused with health knowledge. Our proposal moves the field into exploring semi-supervised and fully unsupervised methods, which only succeed when very large amounts of data are leveraged and knowledge is injected into the methods with care. Our hNLP proposal also targets a key challenge of current hNLP research: the lack of shared software. We seek to provide a clearinghouse for software created under this proposal, and as such all developed tools will be disseminated. Starting from the data characteristics of health texts and information needs of stakeholders, we will develop and evaluate methods for information extraction, information understanding. We will translate our research into the publicly available NLP software platform cTAKES, through robust modules for extraction and understanding across all genres of health texts. We will also demonstrate impact of our methods and tools through several use cases, ranging from clinical point of care to public health, to translational and precision medicine, to participatory medicine. Finally, we will disseminate our work through community activities, such as challenges to advance the state of the art in health natural language processing. PROJECT NARRATIVE  There is a deluge of health texts. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to unravel valuable information from these large data streams with the goal to advance medicine and the wellbeing of patients.

"Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic cigarettes were developed in China in the early 2000s and first introduced to the US market in 2007. Once established in the US, the product experienced explosive growth, with the number of electronic cigarette users doubling every year between 2008 and 2012. In 2012, it was estimated that 75% of US adults had heard of electronic cigarettes, and 8% had tried them. While electronic cigarettes have been studied over the last sev- eral years, no scientific consensus has emerged regarding either the safety of electronic cigarettes, or their po- tential as a smoking cessation aid. With this proposal, we will investigate how electronic cigarette use is documented in the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record, focusing specifically on the relationship between electronic cigarette use and com- bustible tobacco use, with the goal of understanding both how electronic cigarette use is documented in the context of the United States’ only nationwide health system, and how electronic cigarette related information can be reliably extracted from narrative clinical text using fully automated Natural Language Processing meth- ods. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research focuses on the use of Natural Language Processing methods to automatically extract mentions of electronic cigarette use from the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record. The research will provide insight into important, currently unresolved questions regarding how clinicians record electronic cigarette use in the context of a nationwide health system, and whether patients report the use of electronic cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid or use the devices in conjunction with combustible tobacco.",Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR,9652537,R03DA047577,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'China', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Professional Organizations', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Smoking', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Tweens', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'authority', 'electronic cigarette use', 'electronic cigarette user', 'electronic hookah', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'men', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'systems research', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'vaping']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R03,2019,76250,0.047041437209476136
"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team. Through this career development plan, Dr. Shah will build upon her prior training in clinical cardiology and research methodology and lay a strong foundation for a high impact research career.

"Developing Evidence- based User Centered Design and Implementation Guidelines to Improve Health Information Technology Usability ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to provide an evidence-base to better inform user centered design and implementation processes to improve health information technology (health IT) usability and safety. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-15-005). Utilizing a hybrid approach of expert manual review and machine learning techniques, specifically natural language processing, we will develop methods to rapidly analyze patient safety event data to determine which events are health IT related. We will then further categorize the health IT related safety events to determine which events could have been prevented by effective usability or implementation processes. Through this analysis we will be able to specify the usability and implementation processes that are critical to the safe and effective use of health IT. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health IT, and computer science. The proposed research is based on unique insights that our team gleaned from previous research that we conducted focusing on health IT vendor design and implementation processes. The application addresses fundamental aspects of the call for applications by providing an evidence base to improve health IT usability and safety to better inform policy and practice. This research effort is being conducted in partnership with a health IT vendor and a patient safety organization to ensure that our results align with vendor needs and to ensure the results are generalizable. Contributions from this research will include a fundamental understanding of the critical user centered design and implementation processes to inform vendor and provider practice. Our research will also provide organizations like the Office of the National Coordinator with the information to better inform health IT policy.

"Collaborative Research: Statistical algorithms for anomaly  detection and patterns recognition in patient care and safety event reports     Medical errors have been shown to be the third leading cause of death in the United States. The Institute of Medicine and several state legislatures have recommended the use of patient safety event reporting systems (PSRS) to better understand and improve safety hazards. Numerous healthcare providers have adopted these systems, which provide a framework for healthcare provlder staff to report patient safety events. Public databases like MAUDE and VAERS have also been created to collect and trend safety events across healthcare systems. A patient safety event (PSE) report generally consists of both structured and unstructured data elements. Structured data are pre-defined, fixed fields that solicit specific information about the event. The unstructured data fields generally include a free text field where the reporter can enter a text description of the event. The text descriptions are often a rich data source in that the reporter ls not constrained to limited categories or selection options and is able to freely descrlbe the details of the event. The goal of this project is to develop novel statistical methods to analyze unstructured text like patient safety event reports arising in healthcare, which can lead to significant improvements to patient safety and enable timely intervention strategies. We address three problems: (a) Building realistic and meaningful baseline models for near misses, and detecting systematic deterioration of adverse outcomes relative to such baselines; (b) Understanding critical factors that lead to near misses & quantifying severity of outcomes; and (c) ldentifylng document groups of interest. We will use novel statistical approaches that combine Natural Language Processing with Statistical Process Monitoring, Statistical Networks Analysis, and Spatio-temporal Modeling to build a generalizable toolbox that can address these issues in healthcare. An important advantage of our research team is the involvement of healthcare domain experts and access to frontline staff, and we will leverage this strength to develop our algorithms. A key feature of our work is the generalizability of our methods, which will be applicable to biomedical documents arising across a remarkable variety of areas, such as patient safety and equipment malfunction reports, electronic health records, adverse drug or vaccine reports, etc. We will also release open source software via R packages & GitHub, which will enable healthcare staff and researchers to execute our methods on their datasets. Estimates of preventable adverse events in healthcare are staggering, despite the frequently cited Institute of Medicine (IOM) report that first brought attention to the problem over ten years ago. Identifying temporal trends and patterns in the data is particularly important to improving patient safety and patient care. Using our algorithms to effectively analyze documents from reporting systems has the potential to dramatically improve the safety and quality of care by exposing possible weaknesses in the care process.",Collaborative Research: Statistical algorithms for anomaly  detection and patterns recognition in patient care and safety event reports    ,9914443,R01LM013309,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment Malfunction', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Interest Group', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Report (document)', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'hazard', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'spatiotemporal', 'trend']",NLM,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2019,279001,0.02233242751555683
"Application of a Machine Learning to Enhance e-Triggers to Detect and Learn from Diagnostic Safety Events The frequency of diagnostic errors in emergency departments (ED) is largely unknown but likely to be significant. There is a compelling need to create measurement methods that provide diagnostic safety data to clinicians and leaders who in turn can act upon these data to prevent diagnostic harm. Electronic trigger (e- trigger) tools mine vast amounts of clinical and administrative data to identify signals for likely adverse events and have demonstrated capability to identify diagnostic errors. Such tools are more efficient and effective than other methods and can reduce the number of records requiring human review to those at highest risk of harm.  In prior work, we used rules-based e-trigger algorithms to identify patterns of care suggestive of missed or delayed diagnoses in primary care and inpatient settings. For instance, a clinic visit followed several days later by an unplanned hospitalization could be indicative of potential problems with the diagnostic process at the clinic visit. We also proposed a knowledge discovery framework, the Safer Dx Trigger Tools Framework, to enable health care organizations (HCOs) to develop and implement e-trigger tools to measure diagnostic errors using comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) data. Review and analysis of these cases can uncover safety concerns and provide information on diagnostic process breakdowns and related contributory factors, which in turn could generate learning and feedback for improvement purposes.  Sophisticated techniques from machine learning (ML) and data science could help inform ‘second generation’ e-trigger algorithms that better identify diagnostic errors and/or harm than rules-based e-triggers that require substantial manual effort and chart reviews. In contrast to rules-based systems, ML techniques could help learn from examples and accurately retrieve charts with diagnostic error without the need for “hand crafting” of an e-trigger. We will apply e-triggers to comprehensive EHRs that contain longitudinal patient care data (progress notes, tests, referrals) that provide an extensive picture of patients’ diagnostic journeys. Using national VA data, including data from 9 million veterans, and data from Geisinger health system, a pioneer HCO that serves approximately 3 million patients, we propose the following aims: Aim 1 – To develop, refine, test, and apply Safer Dx e-triggers to enable detection, measurement, and learning from diagnostic errors in diverse emergency department (ED) settings. We will calculate the frequency of diagnostic errors in the ED based on these e-triggers and describe the burden of preventable diagnostic harm. Aim 2 - To explore machine learning techniques that yield robust, accurate models to predict diagnostic errors using EHR-enriched data derived from expert-labeled patient records containing diagnostic errors (from Aim 1).  To our knowledge this is the first ML application in diagnostic error measurement, which could help scale up expert-driven e-trigger development and refinement. Newly developed e-triggers can be pilot tested and implemented at other HCOs, enabling them to create actionable safety-related insights from digital data. Narrative The process of making a diagnosis in emergency departments can be vulnerable to error. To study the risks involved, we will develop strategies to better identify electronic medical records of patients who may have had a diagnostic error in their care. We will test the use of human-derived rule-based algorithms and data-driven machine learning methods that can more accurately and efficiently identify these medical records than other currently available methods used in measurement of patient safety.",Application of a Machine Learning to Enhance e-Triggers to Detect and Learn from Diagnostic Safety Events,9938114,R01HS027363,[' '],AHRQ,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,496121,0.00861201320814954
"Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health care-associated infections (HAIs) affect one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $10 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. Current efforts at detection of HAIs are limited to manual chart review which hinders the generalizability and scalability of HAI detection. My goal in seeking a Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to develop a health services research career as a principal investigator focusing on leveraging novel health information technology (HIT) tools to improve the measurement of surgical health care quality, safety, and effectiveness. To continue my progress towards this goal, the objective of this project is to address the challenges of HAI detection by developing a robust and portable automated HAI surveillance toolkit. This toolkit will combine structured electronic health record (EHR) data with rich information locked in clinical notes using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. Our overall hypothesis is that combining structured variables from the EHR supplemented with NLP will improve our ability to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives for this application, I will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the EHR data elements indicative of postoperative HAIs and evaluate the performance of a novel HAI surveillance algorithm; 2) Identify the presence of postoperative SSIs from clinical notes using an automated portable NLP-based algorithm; 3) Apply user-centered design to create a high fidelity prototype of a surgical quality dashboard incorporating our HAI case detection methodology. This contribution is a significant first step in a continuum of research that utilizes the large amounts of data in the EHR combined with novel HIT methods to improve the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness. This approach is significant because the tools developed in this proposal have potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale. The proposed research is innovative in its approach using a combination of structured and unstructured data in the EHR along with novel machine learning and NLP tools to create a generalizable surveillance toolkit for the detection of HAIs. This proposal is responsive to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-011) specifically addressing the use of HIT to improve quality measurement. I have assembled a mentoring team who all internationally recognized experts with long and successful track records of funding and trainee mentorship. This project will provide the means to place me on a trajectory towards a health services research career focused on improving the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness using novel HIT tools. In summary, my previous training and experience, innovative research plan, high-quality training plan, first-rate mentorship team, and supportive research environment give me the highest likelihood of success to research independence with the proposed K08 award. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The proposed research and career development plan are relevant to public health because health care- associated infections (HAIs) affect about one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $30 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. The objective of this project is to develop robust and portable automated surveillance toolkit that combines structured EHR data with rich information locked in clinical notes using natural language processing to identify HAIs after surgical procedures.

"5/6 COMpAAAS U24: Resource in Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) The overall aim of the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/Aids, Alcohol, Aging, & multi- Substance use (COMpAAAS) is to build and disseminate the evidence needed to optimize care for HIV+ experiencing medical harm from alcohol and related substance use, through coordinated, integrated, and externally validated observational, operations research modeling, and intervention studies. Combining and integrating the complimentary expertise of informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, we propose a U24 Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) to support and inform the other COMpAAAS components. This resource will address the complex challenges required to maximize power and minimize bias in analyses addressing consortium-wide questions. Advanced informatics methods supported include natural language processing (NLP), ontologies, database and clinical decision support, and application of vital data management tools for secure data collection, storage, annotation, retrieval, and integration. Advanced epidemiological and statistical methods include time-updated exposure techniques, multiple imputation, propensity score techniques, measurement error correction, and competing risks regression. Routine, but essential, statistical methods include Cox proportional hazards, logistic and linear regression, goodness of fit diagnostics, and agreement/accuracy metrics (kappa, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). The RIB will further leverage the observational and interventional studies, simulation models, and well-coordinated network of cores and workgroups of COMpAAAS with advanced informatics and biostatistical techniques tailored to the particular challenges of large scale, longitudinal data from multiple sources including electronic health records (EHR), clinical interventions, patient self-report, and tissue repositories. Our specific aims are to provide 1) statistical and 2) informatics expertise for COMpAAAS to maximize scientific impact. To accomplish this, we will enhance the design, recruitment, and follow-up of intervention studies, support appropriate design and execution of data analyses and cross cohort collaborations, provide advanced statistical methods plus estimates of alcohol patterns for OR modeling and identify sexual/gender minority populations (CHAMP) from VACS survey data. In addition we will enhance the Consortium Web-Based Laboratory (WBL Portal) informatics infrastructure to support ongoing research design, data collection and management, development and testing of interventions such as clinical decision support and eHealth tools and enhance support for the analysis of textual data. The Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) will extend and enhance the research capacities and productivity among investigators at the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/AIDS, Alcohol, Aging, and multi-Substance use (COMpAAAS).

"Community Surveillance of Coronary Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract  Preventing the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its recurrence, and reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with AMI, remain of significant public health and clinical concern. Monitoring contemporary trends in AMI incidence, treatment, and in-hospital and long-term outcomes is of considerable importance given periodic national updates of treatment guidelines, emphasis on reducing hospital readmissions, and revised definitions and classifications of AMI. Continuously supported by the NHLBI, we have conducted more than 35 years of population-based surveillance of AMI incidence and attack rates, hospital management practices, and the in-hospital and long-term prognosis associated with AMI among residents of central MA hospitalized at all central MA medical centers. We have a highly experienced team of cardiologists, epidemiologists, clinical informatics, and health services researchers who will build on multi- decade long trends (1975-2011) in our principal study endpoints examined previously in this study to the two new study years of patients hospitalized with AMI at all central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017.  To sustain our efforts into the era of electronic medical records (EMRs), and after implementation of the ICD-10 system in 2015, we will develop a new automated AMI surveillance system that efficiently utilizes EMRs by taking advantage of state-of-art natural language processing (NLP) methods that will be compatible with ICD-10 (Aim 1). We will use the new NLP method to streamline traditional chart review-based collection of socio-demographic, clinical, treatment, and hospital and post-discharge outcomes data in patients hospitalized with AMI at all 11 central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017. The data extracted from NLP-streamlined chart reviews will be used to validate and refine the NLP system. Issues related to changes from ICD-9 to ICD- 10 will be carefully addressed. The new NLP-enriched EMR-based surveillance system will eventually be implemented in all participating central MA hospitals. Using the NLP-enriched and EMR-based surveillance data, we will monitor the contemporary clinical epidemiology of AMI, and out-of-hospital deaths due to coronary disease, and changing landscape, over a more than 40 year period (1975-2017) (Aim 2).  The new EMR-based and NLP-enriched system will enhance the population-based surveillance of acute coronary disease. This new system will be cost-effective, more efficient and near-real time, have greater accuracy and precision, and can be readily updated to accommodate changes in information technologies and broadly applicable to other hospital systems. It will support our continued efforts to provide unique community- based observational data on several populations that are often excluded from clinical trials, and that are increasing in numbers, namely the elderly and patients with multiple morbidities. Furthermore, it will generate critical data to inform more national clinical guidelines on the enhanced prevention and management of AMI. If successful, the system can serve as a model and be implemented statewide in MA and elsewhere in the US. Project Narrative  The results of the proposed community-based study will provide data about 40 year trends with regards to the changing magnitude of, and outcomes associated with, heart attacks in residents of a large central New England community. The results of this investigation will also provide contemporary insights on how patients who experience heart attacks in the community are treated by physicians.",Community Surveillance of Coronary Heart Disease,9615037,R01HL135219,"['Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'American', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Case Fatality Rates', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Epidemiologist', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Hospital Administration', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Information Technology', 'Inpatients', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investigation', 'Life Expectancy', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Reperfusion', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Practice Management', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Rural', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health disparity', 'high risk population', 'hospital readmission', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'prevent', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'surveillance data', 'treatment guidelines', 'trend']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2019,784820,0.013120617233153779
"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care.

"National Infrastructure for Standardized and Portable EHR Phenotyping Algorithms PROJECT SUMMARY With the rapidly growing adoption of patient electronic health record systems (EHRs) due to Meaningful Use, and linkage of EHRs to research biorepositories, evaluating the suitability of EHR data for clinical and translational research is becoming ever more important, with ramifications for genomic and observational research, clinical trials, and comparative effectiveness studies. A key component for identifying patient cohorts in the EHR is to define inclusion and exclusion criteria that algorithmically select sets of patients based on stored clinical data. This process is commonly referred to, as “EHR-driven phenotyping” is time-consuming and tedious due to the lack of a widely accepted and standards-based formal information model for defining phenotyping algorithms. To address this overall challenge, the proposed project will design, build and promote an open-access community infrastructure for standards-based development and sharing of phenotyping algorithms, as well as provide tools and resources for investigators, researchers and their informatics support staff to implement and execute the algorithms on native EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of patient cohorts for clinical and genomic research is a costly and time-consuming process. This bottleneck adversely affects public health by delaying research findings, and in some cases by making research costs prohibitively high. To address this issue, leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) for identifying patient cohorts has become an increasingly attractive option.

"Improving Patient Safety and Clinician Cognitive Support Through eMAR Redesign Project Summary/Abstract Written The objective of the proposed research is to reduce the patient safety hazards associated with electronic medication administration records (eMARs) by, (1) understanding current usability and safety gaps, and (2) creating design and development documents, wireframes, and prototypes to serve as the foundation for future eMARs that will eliminate these gaps. In particular, we focus on communication and information flow challenges between nurses, pharmacists, and physicians during medication administration and use of the eMAR. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-16-009). We will develop a broad understanding of usability and safety hazards associated with eMARs by analyzing a large dataset of 1.7 million patient safety event reports and detailed medication error related narratives. We will then conduct heuristic analyses of current eMARs, and interviews and observations of physicians, nurses, and pharmacists. These data will serve to inform the development of eMAR design documents, wireframes, and prototypes as the foundation for future development. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health information technology (health IT), informatics, and data science. Our research team includes physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and human factors engineers, and experts in natural language processing. In addition, our partnerships include a patient safety organization and a health IT vendor. The proposal addresses fundamental aspects of the call for proposals by providing new insights on the safety of health IT and improves current practices by developing use cases and new prototypes for immediate use by healthIT vendors. Contributions from this research will include a fundamental understanding of the role of health IT during medication administration with a focus on communication and information flow, design, development and testing documents for vendors and providers, and eMAR wireframes and prototypes to improve development. Our research will also provide organizations like the Office of the National Coordinator with medication related test scenarios to assess current health IT systems. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health because it applies the sciences of human factors and informatics to improve the usability and safety of the electronic medication administration records (eMARs), which will ultimately improve patient care. Patient safety event report data will be analyzed to identify usability and safety hazards in eMARs, and interviews and observations will be conducted to identify clinician needs. Based on this knowledge eMAR design documents, wireframes, and prototypes will be developed, tested, and disseminated with the goal of improving communication and information flow to reduce medication related errors.",Improving Patient Safety and Clinician Cognitive Support Through eMAR Redesign,9731456,R01HS025136,[' '],AHRQ,MEDSTAR HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,399999,0.02434788430870935
"Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: The reports of side effects on clinical trials describe expected toxicities of chemotherapy. However, these side effects, also called adverse events, are globally under-reported on trials, which means that clinicians do not have an accurate sense of adverse event rates. In the current system, adverse events are identified through time-consuming, manual medical record review. This study aims to develop a system that uses electronic medical record data to capture complex adverse events of chemotherapy for pediatric cancer and to prove that this method is more accurate than the current adverse event reporting system. The specific aims of this application are to 1) develop algorithms to identify 10 complex adverse events using electronic medical record data from children treated for acute leukemia at two large children's hospitals, 2) compare the accuracy of this new method to that of the current system, and 3) demonstrate the utility of electronic adverse event capture in answering clinical questions by defining the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury. Methods: This study will use data from 1900 children with acute leukemia treated at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) or the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) from 2002 through 2017. Algorithms will be developed to identify adverse events by extracting electronic medical record data at CHOP. Once finalized, the algorithms will be tested at TCH. Using chart abstraction data as the gold standard, the accuracy of electronic ascertainment and of trial adverse event reports will determined, and the relative accuracy of each method will be compared. Lastly, algorithms will extract creatinine results from the electronic medical record and the incidence of acute kidney injury will be determined for each leukemia type and by chemotherapy regimen. Risk factors for acute kidney injury will be explored. Career Goals and Environment: With the support of this K07 award, the applicant, Tamara P. Miller, MD, MSCE, will learn how to use electronic medical record data for clinical research, obtain formal training in clinical informatics and implementation science, develop expertise in clinical trial design, and improve her knowledge of pediatric oncology and skills in scientific writing. To complete these training goals, Dr. Miller has assembled an experienced, complementary, and nurturing mentoring team led by her primary mentor, Richard Aplenc, MD, PhD. Her training plan includes formal coursework in informatics, tutorials, national conferences, and research progress and writing groups. She will benefit from the outstanding depth of resources and opportunities at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania. Her long-term goal is to integrate the novel system of adverse event ascertainment she creates into pediatric oncology trials and to use the accurate datasets she develops to answer clinically important questions. With this award, Dr. Miller will be well-positioned to transition to her goal of an independent clinical research career focused on improving adverse event reporting and supportive care practices in pediatric oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with cancer experience significant side effects from their treatments, but these side effects are under- reported on clinical trials and no work has been done to improve the current system of side effect reporting. This study will create a new system of identifying and reporting side effects that is more accurate and efficient than the current system.

"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems. The resulting symptom dimensions will allow better stratification of risk for clinically-important outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays and early readmissions.",Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology,9445485,R01MH106577,"['Admission activity', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Applaud', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical stratification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Text', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'health data', 'health record', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'natural language', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'public health relevance', 'readmission risk', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'trend']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,376490,0.013259541145525192
"Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing Project Summary Automatic extraction of useful information from clinical texts enables new clinical research tasks and new technologies at the point of care. The natural language processing (NLP) systems that perform this extraction rely on supervised machine learning. The learning process uses manually labeled datasets that are limited in size and scope, and as a result, applying NLP systems to unseen datasets often results in severely degraded performance. Obtaining larger and broader datasets is unlikely due to the expense of the manual labeling process and the difficulty of sharing text data between multiple different institutions. Therefore, this project develops unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms to adapt NLP systems to new data. Domain adaptation describes the process of adapting a machine learning system to new data sources. The proposed methods are unsupervised in that they do not require manual labels for the new data. This project has three aims. The first aim makes use of multiple existing datasets for the same task to study the differences in domains, and uses this information to develop new domain adaptation algorithms. Evaluation uses standard machine learning metrics, and analysis of performance is tightly bounded by strong baselines from below and realistic upper bounds, both based on theoretical research on machine learning generalization. The second aim develops open source software tools to simplify the process of incorporating domain adaptation into clinical text processing workflows. This software will have input interfaces to connect to methods developed in Aim 1 and output interfaces to connect with Apache cTAKES, a widely used open- source NLP tool. Aim 3 tests these methods in an end-to-end use case, adverse drug event (ADE) extraction on a dataset of pediatric pulmonary hypertension notes. ADE extraction relies on multiple NLP systems, so this use case is able to show how broad improvements to NLP methods can improve downstream methods. This aim also creates new manual labels for the dataset for an end-to-end evaluation that directly measures how improvements to the NLP systems lead to improvement in ADE extraction. Project Narrative Software systems that use machine learning to understand clinical text often suffer severe performance loss when they are applied to new data that looks different than the data that they originally learned from. In this project, we develop and implement methods that allow these systems to automatically adapt to the characteristics of a new data source. We evaluate these methods on the clinical research task of adverse drug event detection, which relies on many different variables found in the text of electronic health records.",Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing,9579181,R01LM012918,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Apache', 'Area', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Human', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Network-based', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'case finding', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'method development', 'natural language', 'new technology', 'news', 'novel', 'open source', 'point of care', 'social media', 'software systems', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tumor', 'unsupervised learning']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,416066,0.02066145513950768

"Open Health Natural Language Processing Collaboratory Project Summary One of the major barriers in leveraging Electronic Health Record (EHR) data for clinical and translational science is the prevalent use of unstructured or semi-structured clinical narratives for documenting clinical information. Natural Language Processing (NLP), which extracts structured information from narratives, has received great attention and has played a critical role in enabling secondary use of EHRs for clinical and translational research. As demonstrated by large scale efforts such as ACT (Accrual of patients for Clinical Trials), eMERGE, and PCORnet, using EHR data for research rests on the capabilities of a robust data and informatics infrastructure that allows the structuring of clinical narratives and supports the extraction of clinical information for downstream applications. Current successful NLP use cases often require a strong informatics team (with NLP experts) to work with clinicians to supply their domain knowledge and build customized NLP engines iteratively. This requires close collaboration between NLP experts and clinicians, not feasible at institutions with limited informatics support. Additionally, the usability, portability, and generalizability of the NLP systems are still limited, partially due to the lack of access to EHRs across institutions to train the systems. The limited availability of EHR data limits the training available to improve the workforce competence in clinical NLP. We aim to address the above challenges by extending our existing collaboration among multiple CTSA hubs on open health natural language processing (OHNLP) to share distributional information of NLP artifacts (i.e., words, n-grams, phrases, sentences, concept mentions, concepts, and text segments) acquired from real EHRs across multiple institutions. We will leverage the advanced privacy-preserving computing infrastructure of iDASH (integrating Data for Analysis, Anonymization, and SHaring) for privacy- preserving data analysis models and will partner with diverse communities including Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), PCORnet, and Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) to demonstrate the utility of NLP for translational research. This CTSA innovation award RFA provides us with a unique opportunity to address the challenges faced with clinical NLP and through strong partnership with multiple research communities and leadership roles of the research team in clinical NLP, we envision that the successful delivery of this project will broaden the utilization of clinical NLP across the research community. There are four aims planned: i) obtain PHI-suppressed NLP artifacts with retained distribution information across multiple institutions and assess the privacy risk of accessing PHI- suppressed artifacts, ii) generate a synthetic text corpus for exploratory analysis of clinical narratives and assess its utility in NLP tasks leveraging various NLP challenges, iii) develop privacy-preserving computational phenotyping models empowered with NLP, and iv) partner with diverse communities to demonstrate the utility of our project for translational research.

"Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have shown promise for extracting data from the free text of electronic health records (EHRs), but studies have consistently found that techniques do not readily generalize across application settings. Unfortunately, most of the focus in applying NLP to real use cases has remained on a paradigm of single, well-defined application settings, so that generalizability to unseen use cases remains implicitly unaddressed. We propose to explicitly account for unseen application settings by adopting an information retrieval (IR) perspective with the objective of patient-level cohort identification. To do so, we introduce layered language models, an IR framework that enables the reuse of NLP-produced artifacts. Our long term goal is to accelerate investigations of patient health and disease by providing robust, user- centric tools that are necessary to process, retrieve, and utilize the free text of EHRs. The main goal of this proposal is to accurately retrieve ad hoc, realistic cohorts from clinical text at Mayo Clinic and OHSU, establishing methods, resources, and evaluation for patient-level IR. We hypothesize that cohort identification can be addressed in a generalizable fashion by a new IR framework: layered language models. We will test this hypothesis through four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will make medical NLP artifacts searchable in our layered language IR framework. This involves storing and indexing the NLP artifacts, as well as using statistical language models to retrieve documents based on text and its associated NLP artifacts. In Aim 2, we deal with the practical setting of ad hoc cohort identification, moving to patient-level (rather than document-level) IR. To accurately handle patient cohorts in which qualifying evidence may be spread over multiple documents, we will develop and implement patient-level retrieval models that account for cross- document relational and temporal combinations of events. In Aim 3, we will construct parallel IR test collections using EHR data from two sites; a diverse set of cohort queries written by multiple people toward various clinical or epidemiological ends; and assessments of which patients are relevant to which queries at both sites. Finally, in Aim 4, we refine and evaluate patient-level layered language IR on the ad hoc cohort identification task, making comparisons across the users, queries, optimization metrics, and institutions. We will draw additional extrinsic comparisons with pre-existing techniques, e.g., for cohorts from the Electronic Medical Records and Genonmics network. The expected outcomes of the proposed work are: (i) An open-source cohort identification tool, usable by clinicians and epidemiologists, that makes principled use of NLP artifacts for unseen queries; ii) A parallel test collection for cohort identification, includig two intra-institutional document collections, diverse test topics and user-produced text queries, and patient-level judgments of relevance to each query; and (iii) Validation of the reusability of medical NLP via the task of retrieving patient cohorts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  With the widespread adoption of electronic medical records, one might expect that it would be simple for a medical expert to find things like ""patients in the community who suffer from asthma."" Unfortunately, on top of lab tests, medications, and demographic information, there are observations that a physician writes down as text - which are difficult for a computer to understand. Therefore, we aim to process text so that a computer can understand enough of it, and then search that text along with the rest of a patient's medical record; this will allow clinicians or researchers to find and study patients groups of interest.",Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification,9534183,R01LM011934,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Asthma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Institution', 'Interest Group', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Smoke', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Writing', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'cohort', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information model', 'novel', 'open source', 'profiles in patients', 'public health relevance', 'query optimization', 'syntax', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,387966,0.0529927541018058
"Using advanced natural language processing to facilitate documentation of meaningful use and quality payment compliance PROJECT SUMMARY The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Quality Payment Program is designed to motivate healthcare providers to adhere to best practices in clinical healthcare and patient safety. Unfortunately, extracting quality measures data from the clinical record is burdensome and as such, participation among clinical healthcare providers is suboptimal. Our aim is to develop a system to facilitate automatic extraction of quality data. This will reduce the burden of data collection and help remove the barrier to participation that keeps more providers from participating in the program. The proposed project, titled “Using advanced natural language processing to facilitate documentation of meaningful use and quality payment compliance”, aims to develop novel natural language processing methods to recognize key elements from the clinical notes to enable proper documentation of meaningful use and compliance with quality payment. We envision this to be an effective research partnership that leverages the complementary assets of SaferMD, a small business unit, and the University of Michigan, a non-profit research institution, to develop and evaluate a prototype tool to extract clinical quality measures data, and increase participation in the Quality Payment Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project, titled “Using advanced natural language processing to facilitate documentation of meaningful use and quality payment compliance”, aims to develop novel natural language processing methods to recognize key elements from the clinical notes to enable proper documentation of meaningful use and compliance with quality payment. The project will develop algorithms to identify fields relevant for quality measures and develop tools to extract and analyze these data elements from large sets of radiology reports. Finally, the proposed work will initiate the extracted measures into existing quality service offerings by SaferMD.

"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified.

"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management.

"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified. PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 06/09) Page Continuation Format Page PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes innovative intelligent biomedical natural language process approaches to detect ADEs in patients' electronic health records (EHRs), an important step towards ADE surveillance and pharmacovigilance. The focus of this proposal will bon the national priority area of anticoagulants ADE detection, although the algorithms and systems we develop can be extended to other drug classes and diseases.

"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient information in the electronic health record (EHR) such as lab results, medications, and past medical history is the basis for physician decisions about patient care. It also helps patients better understand and manage their care. Efficient access to this patient information is thus essential. One of the most intuitive ways of accessing data is by asking natural language questions. A significant amount of work in medical question answering has been conducted, yet little work has been performed in question answering for EHRs. Natural language questions can be represented in logical forms, a standard structured knowledge representation technique. This project proposes to take natural language EHR questions, both for doctors and patients, and automatically convert them to a logical form. The logical forms can then be converted to a structured query such as those used by EHRs. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of data containing questions annotated with logical forms. This project hypothesizes that a small set of questions can be manually annotated, and then paraphrases can be produced for each annotated question. Since paraphrasing is a simpler task than logical form annotation, crowd-sourcing techniques can be used to collect thousands of question paraphrases. This question paraphrase corpus will then be used to build a semantic grammar capable of recognizing the logical structure of EHR questions. To ensure a robust, generalizable grammar, existing NLP techniques will be used to pre-process questions, simplifying their syntactic structure and abstracting their medical concepts.     In order to develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Kirk Roberts, requires additional training and mentoring in natural language processing and biomedical informatics. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Roberts to achieve the goals of this project as well as transition to a career as an independent researcher. He will be mentored by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, a leading medical NLP researcher, and co-mentored by Dr. Clement McDonald, a leading EHR and medical informatics researcher.     The specific aims of the project are: (1) Build a paraphrase collection of EHR questions, where each prototype question will have many unique paraphrases. The paraphrases encompass different lexical and syntactic means of conveying the same logical form. (2) Construct a semantic grammar for EHR questions. The grammar can then be used to convert a natural language question to a logical form. (3) Implement an end- to-end question analyzer that generalizes EHR questions for improved parsing, parses the question into a logical form using the grammar, and converts the logical form into a leading structured EHR query format. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work aims to significantly improve the ability of both doctors and patients to find information within electronic health records (EHR). By providing an interface to EHRs where users can specify their information needs in the form of a natural language question, the proposed work provides a more intuitive means of finding patient data than is currently available.",Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records,9479293,R00LM012104,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Blood Glucose', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'crowdsourcing', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'health data', 'illiterate', 'improved', 'information organization', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'open source', 'operation', 'patient portal', 'phrases', 'prototype', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2018,248999,0.03699169709486082
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes. Narrative The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the search of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. We will develop methods for feature engineering, electronic phenotyping and patient matching from real-world EHR data.

"Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that optimal treatment is not the same for every patient - it depends on the individual patient's circumstances. One important factor that determines the optimal clinical management is the patient's life expectancy, which determines the temporal horizon within which medical decisions have to operate. For example, while adding an extra diabetes medication may save a 40-year-old individual from going blind or developing kidney failure 20 years later, it will not bring any benefits to an 80-yer old with a metastatic malignancy who is expected to live only a few months.  Consequently, it is critical that when we measure quality of care, suggest treatment options to clinicians through clinical decision support or compare different treatment strategies, we take into account the patient's life expectancy. However, currently there are no methods available that can do this with sufficient accuracy.  Most commonly used techniques to assess a patient's mortality risk draw primarily on administrative data and other structured data fields in electronic medical records. This approach leaves out a large amount of information that is only available in narrative documents such as provider notes, radiology reports, etc. In this project we propose to test the hypothesis that application of two novel technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing (NLP) - could leverage the information in narrative electronic documents to significantly improve the accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.  Dynamic Logic allows to circumvent the challenge of combinatorial complexity that limits the number of variables and their combinations that can be considered as predictors of an outcome by most currently used analytical methods. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly increase the richness of the models for identification of patients with low life expectancy and ultimately improve their accuracy.  Information such as the patient's functional status that is usually only found in narrative documents may be critical to improving accuracy of identifying frail patients at high mortality risk. Modern NLP techniques can effectively identify key concepts in medical text but until now analytical methods allowed consideration of only a few of pre-selected concepts in prediction models. Combining NLP with Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly expand the number of concepts from narrative text that could be included in the life expectancy prediction model, likely leading to a considerable improvement in accuracy.  In the proposed translational multidisciplinary project our team that will include experts on artificial intelligence, natural language processing, analysis of data in electronic medical records, and geriatrics will test whether a combination of Dynamic Logic and NLP improves identification of patients at high risk of death. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identification of patients with limited life expectancy is important for accurate measurement of quality of care delivered by clinicians, clinical decision support in electronic medical records and research that compares different treatment options for patients. However, currently available methods suffer from low accuracy or use information that is not widely available. In this project we propose to combine two advanced computational technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing - to improve accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.",Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy,9481256,R01HS024090,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,227899,0.03754272021020816
"Bayesian Generative Methods for Extracting and Modeling Relations in EHR Narratives Project Summary Medicine has evolved into an era where the entire hospital progressively adopts more real-time monitoring for the patients and generates ICU like clinical data. The rapidly growing data makes ICU a snapshot for tomorrow’s standard of care that should benefit from computer-aided decision making. These data contain not only numerical or coded information, but also a large volume of unstructured narrative text such as physicians’ and nurses' notes, specialists' reports, and discharge summaries. Both types of data have been shown to be highly informative for tasks such as cohort selection, and work best in combination. However, to achieve this, specific bits of information must be extracted from the narrative reports and coded in formal representation. These bits include medical concepts such as symptoms, diseases, medications and procedures; characteristics such as certainty, severity, dose; assertions about these items, such as whether they pertain to the patient or a family member, etc.; relations among these mentions, including indications of what condition is treated by what action and its degree of success, the time sequence and duration of events, and interpretations of laboratory test results as relations among medical concepts such as cells and antigens (e.g., “[large atypical cells] express [CD30]”). Concepts and assertions can be regarded as simple relations, and our proposal focuses on modeling narrative relations to augment structured data for predicting patient outcomes. Most existing techniques for interpreting clinical narratives either rely on hand-crafted rule systems and large medical thesauri or are based on machine learning models that create classification or regression models from large annotated data sets. The former are difficult and laborious to generalize, whereas the latter require large volumes of human-labeled data and may result in models whose operation is difficult to interpret and is therefore considered unsuitable for computer-aided decision making. We propose to build on our previous work to use unsupervised learning methods that identify frequent patterns in un-annotated narratives and identify informative patterns by tensor factorization. Although existing methods can also identify patterns that are meaningful in a data-driven sense, these patterns are difficult for clinicians to understand. Our specific goal is to develop a novel method that uses a Bayesian generative model that integrates relation mining with tensor factorization to learn patterns that correspond to an understanding of the clinical domain and can be used for evidence based patient outcome prediction. Our framework represents relations in clinical narratives as graphs, then mines subgraphs for important relations. These relations are used as features in building up a tensor model in order to reduce dimensionality, discover coherent groups of relations, and explore the group interactions. We develop Bayesian formulation to integrate relation mining and tensor modeling in a generative model, to incorporate existing medical knowledge as probability priors, as well as to reliably estimate the posterior probabilities and confidence intervals of any findings from the model. Rapid growth in the hospital adoption of large volume of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has led to an unprecedented availability of narrative dataset for clinical and translational research. We propose the development of a novel Bayesian generative framework to enable extraction of accurate and clinically meaningful patterns of EHR narratives in order to support evidence based diagnostic reasoning and outcome risk prediction.",Bayesian Generative Methods for Extracting and Modeling Relations in EHR Narratives,9535479,R21LM012618,"['Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Appearance', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Assisted', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Family member', 'Formulation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Research Council', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TNFRSF8 gene', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Thesauri', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'data warehouse', 'diagnostic panel', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'rapid growth', 'real time monitoring', 'standard of care', 'success', 'unsupervised learning']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2018,181755,0.013487087076929229
"Extended Methods and Software Development for Health NLP PROJECT SUMMARY There is a deluge of health-related texts in many genres, from the clinical narrative to newswire and social media. These texts are diverse in content, format, and style, and yet they represent complementary facets of biomedical and health knowledge. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to extract, understand, and distill valuable information from these overwhelming large and complex streams of data, with the ultimate goal to advance biomedicine and impact the health and wellbeing of patients. There have been a number of success stories in various biomedical NLP applications, but the NLP methods investigated are usually tailored to one specific phenotype and one institution, thus reducing portability and scalability. Moreover, while there has been much work in the processing of clinical texts, other genres of health texts, like narratives and posts authored by health consumers and patients, are lacking solutions to marshal and make sense of the health information they contain. Robust NLP solutions that answer the needs of biomedicine and health in general have not been fully investigated yet. A unified, data-science approach to health NLP enables the exploration of methods and solutions unprecedented up to now.  Our vision is to unravel the information buried in the health narratives by advancing text-processing methods in a unified way across all the genres of texts. The crosscutting theme is the investigation of methods for health NLP (hNLP) made possible by big data, fused with health knowledge. Our proposal moves the field into exploring semi-supervised and fully unsupervised methods, which only succeed when very large amounts of data are leveraged and knowledge is injected into the methods with care. Our hNLP proposal also targets a key challenge of current hNLP research: the lack of shared software. We seek to provide a clearinghouse for software created under this proposal, and as such all developed tools will be disseminated. Starting from the data characteristics of health texts and information needs of stakeholders, we will develop and evaluate methods for information extraction, information understanding. We will translate our research into the publicly available NLP software platform cTAKES, through robust modules for extraction and understanding across all genres of health texts. We will also demonstrate impact of our methods and tools through several use cases, ranging from clinical point of care to public health, to translational and precision medicine, to participatory medicine. Finally, we will disseminate our work through community activities, such as challenges to advance the state of the art in health natural language processing. PROJECT NARRATIVE  There is a deluge of health texts. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to unravel valuable information from these large data streams with the goal to advance medicine and the wellbeing of patients. We will advance state-of-the-art NLP by designing robust, scalable methods that leverage health big data, demonstrating relevance on high-impact use cases, and disseminating NLP tools for the research community and public at large.",Extended Methods and Software Development for Health NLP,9421556,R01GM114355,"['Apache', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Information Resources', 'Institution', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Marshal', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Philosophy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Vision', 'Work', 'commercialization', 'design', 'health knowledge', 'improved', 'information organization', 'method development', 'novel', 'point of care', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'social media', 'software development', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,793522,0.016697020574551098
"Evaluating the Impact of Changes in Opioid Prescribing Across Health Systems Implementing Zero Suicide This timely supplement would support our goals for the current award: An Evaluation of the National Zero Suicide Model Across Learning Healthcare Systems (U01MH114087) by capitalizing on a natural experiment, the planned the national roll-out of safety planning templates in behavioral health departments across five Kaiser Permanente regions and Henry Ford Health System in 2019. Safety planning is a highly recommended practice within the Zero Suicide (ZS) framework, but little is known about the effectiveness of the individual elements that can make up a safety plan, such as lethal means assessment, identification of supportive contacts, coping skills, warning signs, and sources of distraction. The current Zero Suicide award proposes to examine the impact of safety planning and lethal means assessment using a stepped-wedged interrupted time- series (ITS) approach, measuring each as a binary variable (e.g. safety planning did or did not occur). The ITS approach requires that some sites implement safety planning (intervention sites for safety planning), while others do not (control sites for safety planning). The proposed ITS approach is now problematic without further work for two reasons: 1) All Kaiser Permanente sites and Henry Ford have decided to uniformly implement safety planning around the same time, therefore there are no control sites 2) Without control sites, metrics that can accurately measure variation in safety planning/lethal means assessment at baseline and then longitudinally thereafter would enable our evaluation to take place, but all of the documentation lives in text- based clinical narratives. In working with our health system leads on the development of Zero Suicide metrics, we have been informed that the rate for safety planning and lethal means assessment at baseline is not zero, but the actual rate is unknown. This supplement will support development of new metrics using Natural Language Processing to determine baseline rates, from which, we can quantify the change in safety planning and lethal means assessment practice longitudinally after implementation of new safety planning templates using our Zero Suicide main award. Furthermore, we propose to take advantage of the newly implemented templates to address an important mediator of the effect of safety planning on suicide outcomes, the impact of fidelity to the new templates, which we define as quality, completeness, and level of integration with ongoing care. We propose the following three specific aims for this supplemental work: 1) Identify key terms for safety planning and lethal means assessment 1.) Develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) metrics to assess the occurrence of safety planning and lethal means assessment at three Zero Suicide sites 2) Implement NLP queries for identification of safety planning and lethal means assessment and measure baseline rates 3) Upon implementation of electronic safety planning templates in medical records, develop and implement metrics using NLP for assessing fidelity (completeness, quality, integration with care) to safety planning templates. Project Narrative: This supplement to the current award: An Evaluation of the National Zero Suicide Model Across Learning Healthcare Systems (U01MH114087) will take advantage of a national roll-out for safety planning templates in the electronic medical record across 5 Kaiser Permanente regions and Henry Ford Health System. It will support the development of innovative measures using natural language processing to efficiently quantify the baseline rates of safety planning and lethal means assessment across multiple sites, which will enable a rigorous evaluation to take place upon implementation of the new electronic templates. Furthermore, we propose to take advantage of the safety planning template roll-out by measuring fidelity (quality, completeness, and level of integration with care), because it may be an important mediator of the relationship between safety planning and suicide outcomes.",Evaluating the Impact of Changes in Opioid Prescribing Across Health Systems Implementing Zero Suicide,9676620,U01MH114087,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Colorado', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coping Skills', 'Country', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Firearms', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral outcome', 'design', 'distraction', 'health plan', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'prescription opioid', 'reducing suicide', 'safety practice', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicide model', 'tool']",NIMH,HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEM,U01,2018,262124,-0.09207554276609412
"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team. Through this career development plan, Dr. Shah will build upon her prior training in clinical cardiology and research methodology and lay a strong foundation for a high impact research career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Atrial fibrillation affects six million US adults, and the prevalence is expected to double by 2030. As new drug and device treatments for stroke prevention emerge, patients and providers increasingly need accurate methods to monitor and improve patient safety.",Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification,9460286,K08HL136850,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulants', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development Plans', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Vital Status', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'aging population', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'effectiveness research', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'personalized medicine', 'portability', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'stroke risk', 'stroke treatment', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K08,2018,163080,0.005832975114764677
"Developing Evidence- based User Centered Design and Implementation Guidelines to Improve Health Information Technology Usability ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to provide an evidence-base to better inform user centered design and implementation processes to improve health information technology (health IT) usability and safety. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-15-005). Utilizing a hybrid approach of expert manual review and machine learning techniques, specifically natural language processing, we will develop methods to rapidly analyze patient safety event data to determine which events are health IT related. We will then further categorize the health IT related safety events to determine which events could have been prevented by effective usability or implementation processes.

"Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health care-associated infections (HAIs) affect one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $10 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. Current efforts at detection of HAIs are limited to manual chart review which hinders the generalizability and scalability of HAI detection. My goal in seeking a Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to develop a health services research career as a principal investigator focusing on leveraging novel health information technology (HIT) tools to improve the measurement of surgical health care quality, safety, and effectiveness. To continue my progress towards this goal, the objective of this project is to address the challenges of HAI detection by developing a robust and portable automated HAI surveillance toolkit. This toolkit will combine structured electronic health record (EHR) data with rich information locked in clinical notes using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. Our overall hypothesis is that combining structured variables from the EHR supplemented with NLP will improve our ability to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives for this application, I will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the EHR data elements indicative of postoperative HAIs and evaluate the performance of a novel HAI surveillance algorithm; 2) Identify the presence of postoperative SSIs from clinical notes using an automated portable NLP-based algorithm; 3) Apply user-centered design to create a high fidelity prototype of a surgical quality dashboard incorporating our HAI case detection methodology. This contribution is a significant first step in a continuum of research that utilizes the large amounts of data in the EHR combined with novel HIT methods to improve the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness. This approach is significant because the tools developed in this proposal have potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale. The proposed research is innovative in its approach using a combination of structured and unstructured data in the EHR along with novel machine learning and NLP tools to create a generalizable surveillance toolkit for the detection of HAIs. This proposal is responsive to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-011) specifically addressing the use of HIT to improve quality measurement. I have assembled a mentoring team who all internationally recognized experts with long and successful track records of funding and trainee mentorship. This project will provide the means to place me on a trajectory towards a health services research career focused on improving the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness using novel HIT tools. In summary, my previous training and experience, innovative research plan, high-quality training plan, first-rate mentorship team, and supportive research environment give me the highest likelihood of success to research independence with the proposed K08 award.

"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",9534182,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'patient-clinician communication', 'personalized medicine', 'tool', 'trend analysis']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2018,335217,0.03690607077009792
"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research.

"5/6 COMpAAAS U24: Resource in Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) The overall aim of the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/Aids, Alcohol, Aging, & multi- Substance use (COMpAAAS) is to build and disseminate the evidence needed to optimize care for HIV+ experiencing medical harm from alcohol and related substance use, through coordinated, integrated, and externally validated observational, operations research modeling, and intervention studies. Combining and integrating the complimentary expertise of informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, we propose a U24 Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) to support and inform the other COMpAAAS components. This resource will address the complex challenges required to maximize power and minimize bias in analyses addressing consortium-wide questions. Advanced informatics methods supported include natural language processing (NLP), ontologies, database and clinical decision support, and application of vital data management tools for secure data collection, storage, annotation, retrieval, and integration. Advanced epidemiological and statistical methods include time-updated exposure techniques, multiple imputation, propensity score techniques, measurement error correction, and competing risks regression. Routine, but essential, statistical methods include Cox proportional hazards, logistic and linear regression, goodness of fit diagnostics, and agreement/accuracy metrics (kappa, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). The RIB will further leverage the observational and interventional studies, simulation models, and well-coordinated network of cores and workgroups of COMpAAAS with advanced informatics and biostatistical techniques tailored to the particular challenges of large scale, longitudinal data from multiple sources including electronic health records (EHR), clinical interventions, patient self-report, and tissue repositories. Our specific aims are to provide 1) statistical and 2) informatics expertise for COMpAAAS to maximize scientific impact. To accomplish this, we will enhance the design, recruitment, and follow-up of intervention studies, support appropriate design and execution of data analyses and cross cohort collaborations, provide advanced statistical methods plus estimates of alcohol patterns for OR modeling and identify sexual/gender minority populations (CHAMP) from VACS survey data. In addition we will enhance the Consortium Web-Based Laboratory (WBL Portal) informatics infrastructure to support ongoing research design, data collection and management, development and testing of interventions such as clinical decision support and eHealth tools and enhance support for the analysis of textual data.

"Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records ABSTRACT This Career Development Application describes targeted coursework and mentored research for progression to independent research in the use of electronic health record data for disease subtyping. Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Use of natural language processing techniques has enabled computational analysis of specific terms found in free text clinical notes. An improved ability to extract symptom information from clinical notes would improve researchers’ ability to use de-identified data from patient records for discovery of disease subtypes. Symptom-related terms are particularly important in the context of mental health, but also harder to detect in notes than other terms like diseases or drug names.  The research aims of this proposal present a novel approach to scalable extension of biomedical terminologies and improved detection of those terms and their modifiers (e.g. severe, familial, absent). The richer dataset that can be extracted using these enhanced approaches is then used to define patient cohorts and to detect disease subtypes and predictors of response to specific pharmaceutical intervention.  Resulting patient stratification will be compared to groupings made without the enriched data and validated on an independent data set. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that enhanced mining of clinical notes will enable statistically significant and clinically relevant symptom-based stratification of psychiatric disorders. In order to test this hypothesis, I will: Aim 1: Develop a semi-automated pipeline for domain-specific terminology extension Aim 2: Define and stratify patient cohorts through use of enhanced term extraction Aim 3: Evaluate the validity and utility of the richer set of data obtained through Aims 1 and 2  One area of greatest need for more evidence-based disease stratification, and also of greatest challenge for a number of reasons, is that of mental health. Mental health disorders account for 30% of non-fatal disease burden world-wide, and pose an economic burden of trillions of dollars and climbing. Moreover, mental health symptoms are generally subjective and self-reported, with few objectively measurable signs. The impact of this proposal is that it will dramatically improve our ability to use EHR data to stratify patients in this drastically underserved area of health and healthcare.  The major innovations of this project are the adaptation and application of a semi-supervised pattern learning pipeline to augment mental health terminologies, and a novel approach to disease stratification using a significantly underutilized source of biomedical data, namely clinical notes.  This work addresses a major challenge for mining clinical notes in rapidly evolving biomedical domains and leverages a valuable source of medical evidence that is largely untapped and underutilized. Together, these methods for enhanced use of clinical notes will enable identification of distinct patient subgroups using data that is sitting idle in EHRs. Project Narrative Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Natural language processing has enabled the use of information from clinical notes in addition to structured data like diagnoses and lab values.

"Community Surveillance of Coronary Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract  Preventing the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its recurrence, and reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with AMI, remain of significant public health and clinical concern. Monitoring contemporary trends in AMI incidence, treatment, and in-hospital and long-term outcomes is of considerable importance given periodic national updates of treatment guidelines, emphasis on reducing hospital readmissions, and revised definitions and classifications of AMI. Continuously supported by the NHLBI, we have conducted more than 35 years of population-based surveillance of AMI incidence and attack rates, hospital management practices, and the in-hospital and long-term prognosis associated with AMI among residents of central MA hospitalized at all central MA medical centers. We have a highly experienced team of cardiologists, epidemiologists, clinical informatics, and health services researchers who will build on multi- decade long trends (1975-2011) in our principal study endpoints examined previously in this study to the two new study years of patients hospitalized with AMI at all central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017.  To sustain our efforts into the era of electronic medical records (EMRs), and after implementation of the ICD-10 system in 2015, we will develop a new automated AMI surveillance system that efficiently utilizes EMRs by taking advantage of state-of-art natural language processing (NLP) methods that will be compatible with ICD-10 (Aim 1). We will use the new NLP method to streamline traditional chart review-based collection of socio-demographic, clinical, treatment, and hospital and post-discharge outcomes data in patients hospitalized with AMI at all 11 central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017. The data extracted from NLP-streamlined chart reviews will be used to validate and refine the NLP system. Issues related to changes from ICD-9 to ICD- 10 will be carefully addressed. The new NLP-enriched EMR-based surveillance system will eventually be implemented in all participating central MA hospitals. Using the NLP-enriched and EMR-based surveillance data, we will monitor the contemporary clinical epidemiology of AMI, and out-of-hospital deaths due to coronary disease, and changing landscape, over a more than 40 year period (1975-2017) (Aim 2).  The new EMR-based and NLP-enriched system will enhance the population-based surveillance of acute coronary disease. This new system will be cost-effective, more efficient and near-real time, have greater accuracy and precision, and can be readily updated to accommodate changes in information technologies and broadly applicable to other hospital systems. It will support our continued efforts to provide unique community- based observational data on several populations that are often excluded from clinical trials, and that are increasing in numbers, namely the elderly and patients with multiple morbidities. Furthermore, it will generate critical data to inform more national clinical guidelines on the enhanced prevention and management of AMI.

"How Does Automated Record Linkage Affect Inferences about Population Health? ABSTRACT  Our broad research objective is to create the Longitudinal Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-dataset (LIFE-M) spanning the late 19th and 20th century United States. Using automated record linkage technology, the LIFE-M project combines millions of vital records to reconstruct how and why individuals' health has changed across time. This multi-generational, longitudinal micro-database aims to transform research on health and longevity, on childbearing and family structure, and on the long-run health effects of early-life circumstances and exposures.  In creating LIFE-M, however, we have encountered serious deficits in knowledge about the performance of automated record linkage technology. The proposed project seeks to evaluate the performance of the most popular and cutting-edge automated linking techniques for the purposes of creating longitudinal health data. Our specific aims are to (1) produce systematic evidence regarding the performance of automated record linking algorithms in terms of match rates, representativeness of the linked sample, erroneous matches (type I errors), and systematic measurement error; (2) examine how phonetic name-cleaning methods affect quality metrics; and (3) examine how record quality metrics vary for different underrepresented subgroups (including women, racial/ethnic minorities, and immigrants) and to determine how linking methods affect representativeness and inferences. To achieve these aims, we have developed new partnerships with record linking experts allowing us to incorporate the most cutting-edge methods in record linking. We will also rely on new “ground truth” generated by LIFE-M project's independent, double-blind human review process.  This project will contribute significantly to existing knowledge about the use of automated linking methods for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health data. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in health studies. Both contributions should greatly enhance the quality of descriptive and causal inferences about population health and aging and disparities in these outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by advancing record linking methodology for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health datasets. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in public health and aging studies using linked records. Both contributions should significantly improve the quality of inferences about public and population health and health disparities.",How Does Automated Record Linkage Affect Inferences about Population Health?,9565480,R21AG056912,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'Birth Records', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Economics', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Four-dimensional', 'Funding', 'Genealogy', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immigrant', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maiden Name', 'Marriage', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Minor', 'Names', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'aging population', 'child bearing', 'cost effective', 'ethnic minority population', 'family structure', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'health knowledge', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'longitudinal database', 'population health', 'racial and ethnic', 'repository', 'social', 'vector']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2018,194895,0.020076440726279697
"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care.

"Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (L-EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. It learns how to do so by analyzing patterns of patient data access f many physicians in many past cases in the EMR, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant for making clinical decisions in a given patient.      The hypothesis underlying this research is that the L-EMR system will have sufficiently high precision and recall in highlighting relevant data, decrease the average time to assess an intensive care unit (ICU) patient case, and be judged by critical care medicine (CCM) physicians to be clinically useful.    The first aim of this project is develop a highly-usable L-EMR user interface. The L-EMR user interface will include zoomable time-series displays of lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. Usability studies of the L-EMR user interface will guide revisions and enhancements.      The second aim of the project is to train statistical models that can be applied to a patient case to predict relevant lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will enlist CCM physicians to review a set of retrospective ICU patient cases on a focused set of clinical conditions. Participants will review these cases as if they were active patients, identifying relevant lab- results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will train and evaluate statistical models to predict relevant data, and identify the best performing algorithm to include in the L-EMR system.      The third aim of the project is to evaluate the L-EMR system. We will recruit CCM physicians to evaluate an L-EMR system based on user interfaces from Aim 1 and statistical models trained using the best performing algorithm in Aim 2 to highlight relevant data items. We will measure the precision and recall of the data-highlighting functionality for assessing patient cases and making clinical decisions (e.g., lab and medication orders), the time required to assess cases with and without the highlighting, and physicians' assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the L-EMR system.    If the results of these experiments are positive, as anticipated, this project will introduce a computational method that has significant potential to improve future EMR systems and enhance patient care. Narrative The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. The system works by analyzing patterns of EMR usage of physicians, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant in a given patient. The main idea underlying the approach is that patterns of past EMR usage patterns can be exploited to selectively highlight clinically useful patient data.",Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System,9521586,R01LM012095,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Blood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'E-learning', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemoglobin', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Provider', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer human interaction', 'data access', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'stem', 'trend', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,452158,0.017881372035377104
"Improving Patient Safety and Clinician Cognitive Support Through eMAR Redesign Project Summary/Abstract Written The objective of the proposed research is to reduce the patient safety hazards associated with electronic medication administration records (eMARs) by, (1) understanding current usability and safety gaps, and (2) creating design and development documents, wireframes, and prototypes to serve as the foundation for future eMARs that will eliminate these gaps. In particular, we focus on communication and information flow challenges between nurses, pharmacists, and physicians during medication administration and use of the eMAR. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-16-009). We will develop a broad understanding of usability and safety hazards associated with eMARs by analyzing a large dataset of 1.7 million patient safety event reports and detailed medication error related narratives. We will then conduct heuristic analyses of current eMARs, and interviews and observations of physicians, nurses, and pharmacists. These data will serve to inform the development of eMAR design documents, wireframes, and prototypes as the foundation for future development. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health information technology (health IT), informatics, and data science. Our research team includes physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and human factors engineers, and experts in natural language processing. In addition, our partnerships include a patient safety organization and a health IT vendor. The proposal addresses fundamental aspects of the call for proposals by providing new insights on the safety of health IT and improves current practices by developing use cases and new prototypes for immediate use by healthIT vendors. Contributions from this research will include a fundamental understanding of the role of health IT during medication administration with a focus on communication and information flow, design, development and testing documents for vendors and providers, and eMAR wireframes and prototypes to improve development. Our research will also provide organizations like the Office of the National Coordinator with medication related test scenarios to assess current health IT systems. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health because it applies the sciences of human factors and informatics to improve the usability and safety of the electronic medication administration records (eMARs), which will ultimately improve patient care. Patient safety event report data will be analyzed to identify usability and safety hazards in eMARs, and interviews and observations will be conducted to identify clinician needs. Based on this knowledge eMAR design documents, wireframes, and prototypes will be developed, tested, and disseminated with the goal of improving communication and information flow to reduce medication related errors.",Improving Patient Safety and Clinician Cognitive Support Through eMAR Redesign,9447854,R01HS025136,[' '],AHRQ,MEDSTAR HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,400000,0.02434788430870935
"Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical error is one of the leading causes of death in the US. The study and reduction of medical errors have become a major concern in healthcare today. It is believed that medical error reporting systems could be a good resource to share and to learn from errors if medical error data are collected in a properly structured format and are useful for the detection of patterns, discovery of underlying factors, and generation of solutions. Effectively gathering information from previous lessons and timely informing the subsequent action are the two major goals for the design, development and utilization of such a system. The Common Formats (CFs) suggested by AHRQ tend to unify the future reporting format, which holds promise in improving data consistency and reducing unsafe conditions through lessons learned. However, effective gathering medical incident data does not merely rely on a unified structure. To be able to learn from previous lessons, it heavily depends upon the quality reports and learning features offered by systems. Medical incident data are always the key components and invaluable assets in patient safety research. The long term goal of the project is to understand the occurrence and causes of medical incidents in real practice and to develop interventions based on collection of incident reports to minimize the recurrence of similar incidents that have been reported. The objective of this application is to improve the utilization f voluntary reporting systems that each healthcare institution has been put in use by developing a learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, automatically link historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews in patient safety. As moving toward CFs, the researchers propose a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach that will help reporters generate complete and accurate reports through user-friendly guidance and offer timely comments and relevant peer reviews through educational tools during and after incident reporting. The researchers employ a case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the knowledge-based toolkit which helps reporters improve the communication about patient safety through clear working definitions and advance training that builds knowledge about the safety culture and then provides continuing education through the system. The project holds promise in revolutionizing the design of voluntary medical incident reporting systems from an incident data repository to an advanced resource promoting complete and accurate incident reporting and learning toward a just and learning culture. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Timely reporting and effective learning from medical incidents is considered an effective way in developing strategies for reducing medical errors. Utilizing an innovative a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach combining with case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques, we propose to develop a knowledgebase and learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, linking historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews on patient safety.

However, secondary data sources often lack the granularity to understand the nature of patient and device complications related to the device removal and additional surgery. The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database houses medical device reports submitted to the FDA by mandatory and voluntary reporters. These reports contain detailed information of patient and device adverse events. But due to its narrative structure, research with the reports has been limited, partially due to the restrictions of keyword search and manual review. The proposed study will innovatively apply natural language processing (NLP) to analyze MAUDE reports of device removals. NLP is a powerful tool capable of extracting information efficiently from documents such as medical notes, allowing the summarization of thousands of adverse event reports in a cost-effective way. The primary aim is to develop an NLP program to extract and summarize patient- and device-specific complications associated with device removal and additional surgeries following hysteroscopic sterilization. Secondary objective is to evaluate the impact of regulatory activities on adverse event reporting behavior and structure. The hypotheses are that the majority of reported removals were associated with device-related complications as opposed to persistent symptoms only, and that after the FDA convened a panel discussion in September 2015, adverse event reports were more likely to be submitted by mandatory reporters, with improvement in structured presentation. Adverse event reports related to device removal will be selected from the MAUDE database using keyword search first, and 1,000 reports will be annotated and used to develop and validate the NLP tool. Applying the developed NLP to all reports, extracted information will be used for the analysis, and comparisons will be made before and after September 2015. The significance of the proposed research is that it will develop a method to better utilize adverse event reports to obtain crucial device safety information supplemental to regular population-level studies. By achieving this, the long term goal is to create a useful tool for future medical device safety surveillance to understand the nature of adverse events. The immediate next step will be to use the tool to investigate device safety in other areas. The comprehension of the nature of device adverse events and the elucidation of the crucial role of regulatory activity in facilitating reliable adverse event reporting will help promote patient safety evaluation and monitoring. Project Narrative The proposed research will focus on device adverse event reports and develop a powerful tool to analyze reports to understand the nature of patient and device complications related to device removals and additional surgeries. The study will also elucidate the impact of regulatory activities on adverse event reporting. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to part of AHRQ's mission to make health care safer.",Developing Evidence for Safety Surveillance from Device Adverse Event Reports,9586941,R03HS026291,[' '],AHRQ,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R03,2018,96907,0.02176897686876757
"Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: The reports of side effects on clinical trials describe expected toxicities of chemotherapy. However, these side effects, also called adverse events, are globally under-reported on trials, which means that clinicians do not have an accurate sense of adverse event rates. In the current system, adverse events are identified through time-consuming, manual medical record review. This study aims to develop a system that uses electronic medical record data to capture complex adverse events of chemotherapy for pediatric cancer and to prove that this method is more accurate than the current adverse event reporting system. The specific aims of this application are to 1) develop algorithms to identify 10 complex adverse events using electronic medical record data from children treated for acute leukemia at two large children's hospitals, 2) compare the accuracy of this new method to that of the current system, and 3) demonstrate the utility of electronic adverse event capture in answering clinical questions by defining the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury. Methods: This study will use data from 1900 children with acute leukemia treated at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) or the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) from 2002 through 2017. Algorithms will be developed to identify adverse events by extracting electronic medical record data at CHOP. Once finalized, the algorithms will be tested at TCH. Using chart abstraction data as the gold standard, the accuracy of electronic ascertainment and of trial adverse event reports will determined, and the relative accuracy of each method will be compared. Lastly, algorithms will extract creatinine results from the electronic medical record and the incidence of acute kidney injury will be determined for each leukemia type and by chemotherapy regimen. Risk factors for acute kidney injury will be explored. Career Goals and Environment: With the support of this K07 award, the applicant, Tamara P. Miller, MD, MSCE, will learn how to use electronic medical record data for clinical research, obtain formal training in clinical informatics and implementation science, develop expertise in clinical trial design, and improve her knowledge of pediatric oncology and skills in scientific writing. To complete these training goals, Dr. Miller has assembled an experienced, complementary, and nurturing mentoring team led by her primary mentor, Richard Aplenc, MD, PhD. Her training plan includes formal coursework in informatics, tutorials, national conferences, and research progress and writing groups. She will benefit from the outstanding depth of resources and opportunities at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania. Her long-term goal is to integrate the novel system of adverse event ascertainment she creates into pediatric oncology trials and to use the accurate datasets she develops to answer clinically important questions. With this award, Dr. Miller will be well-positioned to transition to her goal of an independent clinical research career focused on improving adverse event reporting and supportive care practices in pediatric oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with cancer experience significant side effects from their treatments, but these side effects are under- reported on clinical trials and no work has been done to improve the current system of side effect reporting. This study will create a new system of identifying and reporting side effects that is more accurate and efficient than the current system. The results of this research will provide clinicians, patients and their families with a true understanding of potential side effects of therapies used to treat childhood cancer.",Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials,9568724,K07CA211956,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Acute leukemia', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Child', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncology Group', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxicity due to chemotherapy', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'leukemia', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'oncology trial', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K07,2018,169028,0.003315425406600145
"Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing deployments of electronic health records (EHRs) systems have made massive clinical data available electronically. However, much of detailed clinical information of patients is embedded in narrative text and is not directly accessible for computerized clinical applications. Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information in narrative document, have received great attention in the medical domain. Current state-of-the-art NLP approaches often involve building probabilistic models. However, the wide adoption of statistical methods in clinical NLP faces two grand challenges: 1) the lack of large annotated clinical corpora; and 2) the lack of methodologies that can efficiently integrate linguistic and domain knowledge with statistical learning. High-performance statistical NLP methods rely on large scale and high quality annotations of clinical text, but it is time-consuming and costly to create large annotated clinica corpora as it often requires manual review by physicians. Moreover, the medical domain is knowledge intensive. To achieve optimal performance, probabilistic models need to leverage medical domain knowledge. Therefore, methods that can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost would be highly desirable for clinical text processing.    In this study, we propose to investigate interactive machine learning (IML) methods to address the above challenges in clinical NLP. An IML system builds a classification model in an iterative process, which can actively select informative samples for annotation based on models built on previously annotated samples, thus reducing the annotation cost for model development. More importantly, an IML system also involves human inputs to the learning process (e.g., an expert can specify important features for a classification task based on domain knowledge). Thus, IML is an ideal framework for efficiently integrating rule-based (via domain experts specifying features) and statistics-based (via different learning algorithms) approaches to clinical NLP. To achieve our goal, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we plan to investigate different aspects of IML for word sense disambiguation, including developing new active learning algorithms and conducting cognitive usability analysis for efficient feature annotation by users. To demonstrate the broad uses of IML, we further extend IML approaches to two other important clinical NLP classification tasks: named entity recognition and clinical phenoytping in Aim 2. Finally we propose to disseminate the IML methods and tools to the biomedical research community in Aim 3. Project Narrative In this project, we propose to develop interactive machine learning methods to process clinical text stored in electronic health records (EHRs) systems. Such methods can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost, thus improving performance of text processors. This technology will allow more accurate data extraction from clinical documents, thus to facilitate clinical research that rely on EHRs data.",Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing,9337267,R01LM010681,"['Abbreviations', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Face Processing', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'computerized', 'cost', 'experience', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'novel', 'open source', 'real world application', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'word learning']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2017,463061,0.023285481475899077
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems. The resulting symptom dimensions will allow better stratification of risk for clinically-important outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays and early readmissions.",Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology,9254614,R01MH106577,"['Admission activity', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Applaud', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical stratification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Text', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'health data', 'health record', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'natural language', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'trend']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2017,377260,0.013259541145525192

"Open Health Natural Language Processing Collaboratory Project Summary One of the major barriers in leveraging Electronic Health Record (EHR) data for clinical and translational science is the prevalent use of unstructured or semi-structured clinical narratives for documenting clinical information. Natural Language Processing (NLP), which extracts structured information from narratives, has received great attention and has played a critical role in enabling secondary use of EHRs for clinical and translational research. As demonstrated by large scale efforts such as ACT (Accrual of patients for Clinical Trials), eMERGE, and PCORnet, using EHR data for research rests on the capabilities of a robust data and informatics infrastructure that allows the structuring of clinical narratives and supports the extraction of clinical information for downstream applications. Current successful NLP use cases often require a strong informatics team (with NLP experts) to work with clinicians to supply their domain knowledge and build customized NLP engines iteratively. This requires close collaboration between NLP experts and clinicians, not feasible at institutions with limited informatics support. Additionally, the usability, portability, and generalizability of the NLP systems are still limited, partially due to the lack of access to EHRs across institutions to train the systems. The limited availability of EHR data limits the training available to improve the workforce competence in clinical NLP. We aim to address the above challenges by extending our existing collaboration among multiple CTSA hubs on open health natural language processing (OHNLP) to share distributional information of NLP artifacts (i.e., words, n-grams, phrases, sentences, concept mentions, concepts, and text segments) acquired from real EHRs across multiple institutions. We will leverage the advanced privacy-preserving computing infrastructure of iDASH (integrating Data for Analysis, Anonymization, and SHaring) for privacy- preserving data analysis models and will partner with diverse communities including Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), PCORnet, and Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) to demonstrate the utility of NLP for translational research. This CTSA innovation award RFA provides us with a unique opportunity to address the challenges faced with clinical NLP and through strong partnership with multiple research communities and leadership roles of the research team in clinical NLP, we envision that the successful delivery of this project will broaden the utilization of clinical NLP across the research community. There are four aims planned: i) obtain PHI-suppressed NLP artifacts with retained distribution information across multiple institutions and assess the privacy risk of accessing PHI- suppressed artifacts, ii) generate a synthetic text corpus for exploratory analysis of clinical narratives and assess its utility in NLP tasks leveraging various NLP challenges, iii) develop privacy-preserving computational phenotyping models empowered with NLP, and iv) partner with diverse communities to demonstrate the utility of our project for translational research.

"Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have shown promise for extracting data from the free text of electronic health records (EHRs), but studies have consistently found that techniques do not readily generalize across application settings. Unfortunately, most of the focus in applying NLP to real use cases has remained on a paradigm of single, well-defined application settings, so that generalizability to unseen use cases remains implicitly unaddressed. We propose to explicitly account for unseen application settings by adopting an information retrieval (IR) perspective with the objective of patient-level cohort identification. To do so, we introduce layered language models, an IR framework that enables the reuse of NLP-produced artifacts. Our long term goal is to accelerate investigations of patient health and disease by providing robust, user- centric tools that are necessary to process, retrieve, and utilize the free text of EHRs. The main goal of this proposal is to accurately retrieve ad hoc, realistic cohorts from clinical text at Mayo Clinic and OHSU, establishing methods, resources, and evaluation for patient-level IR. We hypothesize that cohort identification can be addressed in a generalizable fashion by a new IR framework: layered language models. We will test this hypothesis through four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will make medical NLP artifacts searchable in our layered language IR framework. This involves storing and indexing the NLP artifacts, as well as using statistical language models to retrieve documents based on text and its associated NLP artifacts. In Aim 2, we deal with the practical setting of ad hoc cohort identification, moving to patient-level (rather than document-level) IR. To accurately handle patient cohorts in which qualifying evidence may be spread over multiple documents, we will develop and implement patient-level retrieval models that account for cross- document relational and temporal combinations of events. In Aim 3, we will construct parallel IR test collections using EHR data from two sites; a diverse set of cohort queries written by multiple people toward various clinical or epidemiological ends; and assessments of which patients are relevant to which queries at both sites. Finally, in Aim 4, we refine and evaluate patient-level layered language IR on the ad hoc cohort identification task, making comparisons across the users, queries, optimization metrics, and institutions. We will draw additional extrinsic comparisons with pre-existing techniques, e.g., for cohorts from the Electronic Medical Records and Genonmics network. The expected outcomes of the proposed work are: (i) An open-source cohort identification tool, usable by clinicians and epidemiologists, that makes principled use of NLP artifacts for unseen queries; ii) A parallel test collection for cohort identification, includig two intra-institutional document collections, diverse test topics and user-produced text queries, and patient-level judgments of relevance to each query; and (iii) Validation of the reusability of medical NLP via the task of retrieving patient cohorts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  With the widespread adoption of electronic medical records, one might expect that it would be simple for a medical expert to find things like ""patients in the community who suffer from asthma."" Unfortunately, on top of lab tests, medications, and demographic information, there are observations that a physician writes down as text - which are difficult for a computer to understand. Therefore, we aim to process text so that a computer can understand enough of it, and then search that text along with the rest of a patient's medical record; this will allow clinicians or researchers to find and study patients groups of interest.",Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification,9325065,R01LM011934,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Asthma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Institution', 'Interest Group', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Smoke', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Writing', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'cohort', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information model', 'novel', 'open source', 'profiles in patients', 'public health relevance', 'query optimization', 'syntax', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2017,387966,0.0529927541018058
"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified.

"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data. This pioneering research directly impacts public health by improving the quality of care through enhanced reminder functionality in the EHRs.",A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications,9201329,R00LM011575,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Area', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Institution', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Reminder Systems', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'open source', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R00,2017,248969,0.034332982799315154
"Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Supervised machine learning is a popular method that uses labeled training examples to predict future outcomes.  Unfortunately, supervised machine learning for biomedical research is often limited by a lack of labeled data.  Current methods to produce labeled data involve manual chart reviews that are laborious and do not scale with data creation rates.  This project aims to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records by forming a crowd of clinical personnel labelers.  The construction of these labeled data sets will allow for new biomedical research studies that were previously infeasible to conduct.  There are numerous practical and theoretical challenges of developing a crowd sourcing platform for clinical data.  First, popular, public crowd sourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk are not suitable for medical record labeling as HIPAA makes clinical data sharing risky.  Second, the types of clinical questions that are amenable for crowd sourcing are not well understood.  Third, it is unclear if the clinical crowd can produce labels quickly and accurately.  Each of these challenges will be addressed in a separate Aim. As the first Aim of this project, the team will evaluate different clinical crowd sourcing architectures.  The architecture must leverage the scale of the crowd, while minimizing patient information exposure.  De-identification tools will be considered to scrub clinical notes t reduce information leakage.  Using this design, the team will extend a popular open source crowd sourcing tool, Pybossa, and release it to the public.  As the second Aim, the team will study the type, structure, topic and specificity of clinical prediction questions, and how these characteristics impact labeler quality.  Lastly, the team will evaluate the quality and accuracy of collected clinical crowd sourced data on two existing chart review problems to determine the platform's utility. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Traditionally, clinical prediction models rely on supervised machine learning algorithms to probabilistically predict clinical events using labeled medical records.  When data sets are small, manual chart reviews performed by clinical staff are sufficient to label each outcome; however, as data sets have scaled up and researchers aim to study larger cohorts, current manual approaches become intractable.  The goal of this proposal is to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records to support prediction model development.",Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research,9270528,UH2CA203708,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Biomedical Research', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Extravasation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Human Resources', 'Incentives', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Audit', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Research', 'Medical Students', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Privacy', 'Productivity', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'crowdsourcing', 'data sharing', 'design', 'member', 'model development', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'tool']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH2,2017,316000,0.025535882347833404
"Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient information in the electronic health record (EHR) such as lab results, medications, and past medical history is the basis for physician decisions about patient care. It also helps patients better understand and manage their care. Efficient access to this patient information is thus essential. One of the most intuitive ways of accessing data is by asking natural language questions. A significant amount of work in medical question answering has been conducted, yet little work has been performed in question answering for EHRs. Natural language questions can be represented in logical forms, a standard structured knowledge representation technique. This project proposes to take natural language EHR questions, both for doctors and patients, and automatically convert them to a logical form. The logical forms can then be converted to a structured query such as those used by EHRs. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of data containing questions annotated with logical forms. This project hypothesizes that a small set of questions can be manually annotated, and then paraphrases can be produced for each annotated question. Since paraphrasing is a simpler task than logical form annotation, crowd-sourcing techniques can be used to collect thousands of question paraphrases. This question paraphrase corpus will then be used to build a semantic grammar capable of recognizing the logical structure of EHR questions. To ensure a robust, generalizable grammar, existing NLP techniques will be used to pre-process questions, simplifying their syntactic structure and abstracting their medical concepts.     In order to develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Kirk Roberts, requires additional training and mentoring in natural language processing and biomedical informatics. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Roberts to achieve the goals of this project as well as transition to a career as an independent researcher. He will be mentored by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, a leading medical NLP researcher, and co-mentored by Dr. Clement McDonald, a leading EHR and medical informatics researcher.     The specific aims of the project are: (1) Build a paraphrase collection of EHR questions, where each prototype question will have many unique paraphrases. The paraphrases encompass different lexical and syntactic means of conveying the same logical form. (2) Construct a semantic grammar for EHR questions. The grammar can then be used to convert a natural language question to a logical form. (3) Implement an end- to-end question analyzer that generalizes EHR questions for improved parsing, parses the question into a logical form using the grammar, and converts the logical form into a leading structured EHR query format. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work aims to significantly improve the ability of both doctors and patients to find information within electronic health records (EHR). By providing an interface to EHRs where users can specify their information needs in the form of a natural language question, the proposed work provides a more intuitive means of finding patient data than is currently available.",Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records,9254613,R00LM012104,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Blood Glucose', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'crowdsourcing', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'health data', 'illiterate', 'improved', 'information organization', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'open source', 'operation', 'phrases', 'prototype', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2017,248999,0.03699169709486082
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes. Narrative The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the search of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes.

"Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Timely detection of severe patient conditions or concerning events and their mitigation remains an important problem in clinical practice. This is especially true in the critically ill patient. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming, costly, and difficult to extract and implement such knowledge in existing monitoring systems. The research work in this proposal offers computational, rather than expert-based, solutions that build alert systems from data stored in patient data repositories, such as electronic medical records. Briefly, our approach uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify unusual clinical management patterns in individual patients, relative to patterns associated with comparable patients, and raises an alert signaling this discrepancy. Our previous studies provide support that such deviations indicate clinically important events at false alert rates belo 50%, which is very promising. We propose to further improve the new methodology, and build a real-time monitoring and alerting system integrated with production electronic medical records. We propose an evaluation of the system using physicians' assessment of alerts raised by our real-time system for intensive-care unit (ICU) patient cases. The project investigators comprise a multidisciplinary team with expertise in critical care medicine, computer science, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, knowledge based systems, and clinical data repositories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors in the intensive care unit (ICU). This project develops and evaluates a new clinical monitoring and alerting framework that uses electronic medical records and machine-learning methods to send alerts concerning clinical decisions in the ICU that are unexpected given the clinical context and may represent medical errors.",Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams,9278178,R01GM088224,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Practice Management', 'Production', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stream', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data archive', 'design', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'liver transplantation', 'multidisciplinary', 'prototype', 'public health relevance']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,543819,0.02317893775877909
"Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that optimal treatment is not the same for every patient - it depends on the individual patient's circumstances. One important factor that determines the optimal clinical management is the patient's life expectancy, which determines the temporal horizon within which medical decisions have to operate. For example, while adding an extra diabetes medication may save a 40-year-old individual from going blind or developing kidney failure 20 years later, it will not bring any benefits to an 80-yer old with a metastatic malignancy who is expected to live only a few months.  Consequently, it is critical that when we measure quality of care, suggest treatment options to clinicians through clinical decision support or compare different treatment strategies, we take into account the patient's life expectancy. However, currently there are no methods available that can do this with sufficient accuracy.  Most commonly used techniques to assess a patient's mortality risk draw primarily on administrative data and other structured data fields in electronic medical records. This approach leaves out a large amount of information that is only available in narrative documents such as provider notes, radiology reports, etc. In this project we propose to test the hypothesis that application of two novel technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing (NLP) - could leverage the information in narrative electronic documents to significantly improve the accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.  Dynamic Logic allows to circumvent the challenge of combinatorial complexity that limits the number of variables and their combinations that can be considered as predictors of an outcome by most currently used analytical methods. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly increase the richness of the models for identification of patients with low life expectancy and ultimately improve their accuracy.  Information such as the patient's functional status that is usually only found in narrative documents may be critical to improving accuracy of identifying frail patients at high mortality risk. Modern NLP techniques can effectively identify key concepts in medical text but until now analytical methods allowed consideration of only a few of pre-selected concepts in prediction models. Combining NLP with Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly expand the number of concepts from narrative text that could be included in the life expectancy prediction model, likely leading to a considerable improvement in accuracy.  In the proposed translational multidisciplinary project our team that will include experts on artificial intelligence, natural language processing, analysis of data in electronic medical records, and geriatrics will test whether a combination of Dynamic Logic and NLP improves identification of patients at high risk of death. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identification of patients with limited life expectancy is important for accurate measurement of quality of care delivered by clinicians, clinical decision support in electronic medical records and research that compares different treatment options for patients. However, currently available methods suffer from low accuracy or use information that is not widely available. In this project we propose to combine two advanced computational technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing - to improve accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.",Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy,9275946,R01HS024090,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2017,227900,0.03754272021020816
"Bayesian Generative Methods for Extracting and Modeling Relations in EHR Narratives Project Summary Medicine has evolved into an era where the entire hospital progressively adopts more real-time monitoring for the patients and generates ICU like clinical data. The rapidly growing data makes ICU a snapshot for tomorrow’s standard of care that should benefit from computer-aided decision making. These data contain not only numerical or coded information, but also a large volume of unstructured narrative text such as physicians’ and nurses' notes, specialists' reports, and discharge summaries. Both types of data have been shown to be highly informative for tasks such as cohort selection, and work best in combination. However, to achieve this, specific bits of information must be extracted from the narrative reports and coded in formal representation. These bits include medical concepts such as symptoms, diseases, medications and procedures; characteristics such as certainty, severity, dose; assertions about these items, such as whether they pertain to the patient or a family member, etc.; relations among these mentions, including indications of what condition is treated by what action and its degree of success, the time sequence and duration of events, and interpretations of laboratory test results as relations among medical concepts such as cells and antigens (e.g., “[large atypical cells] express [CD30]”). Concepts and assertions can be regarded as simple relations, and our proposal focuses on modeling narrative relations to augment structured data for predicting patient outcomes. Most existing techniques for interpreting clinical narratives either rely on hand-crafted rule systems and large medical thesauri or are based on machine learning models that create classification or regression models from large annotated data sets. The former are difficult and laborious to generalize, whereas the latter require large volumes of human-labeled data and may result in models whose operation is difficult to interpret and is therefore considered unsuitable for computer-aided decision making. We propose to build on our previous work to use unsupervised learning methods that identify frequent patterns in un-annotated narratives and identify informative patterns by tensor factorization. Although existing methods can also identify patterns that are meaningful in a data-driven sense, these patterns are difficult for clinicians to understand. Our specific goal is to develop a novel method that uses a Bayesian generative model that integrates relation mining with tensor factorization to learn patterns that correspond to an understanding of the clinical domain and can be used for evidence based patient outcome prediction. Our framework represents relations in clinical narratives as graphs, then mines subgraphs for important relations. These relations are used as features in building up a tensor model in order to reduce dimensionality, discover coherent groups of relations, and explore the group interactions. We develop Bayesian formulation to integrate relation mining and tensor modeling in a generative model, to incorporate existing medical knowledge as probability priors, as well as to reliably estimate the posterior probabilities and confidence intervals of any findings from the model. Rapid growth in the hospital adoption of large volume of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has led to an unprecedented availability of narrative dataset for clinical and translational research. We propose the development of a novel Bayesian generative framework to enable extraction of accurate and clinically meaningful patterns of EHR narratives in order to support evidence based diagnostic reasoning and outcome risk prediction.",Bayesian Generative Methods for Extracting and Modeling Relations in EHR Narratives,9374626,R21LM012618,"['Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Appearance', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Assisted', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Family member', 'Formulation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injectable', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Research Council', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TNFRSF8 gene', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Thesauri', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'diagnostic panel', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'rapid growth', 'standard of care', 'success']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2017,208272,0.013487087076929229
"Extended Methods and Software Development for Health NLP PROJECT SUMMARY There is a deluge of health-related texts in many genres, from the clinical narrative to newswire and social media. These texts are diverse in content, format, and style, and yet they represent complementary facets of biomedical and health knowledge. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to extract, understand, and distill valuable information from these overwhelming large and complex streams of data, with the ultimate goal to advance biomedicine and impact the health and wellbeing of patients. There have been a number of success stories in various biomedical NLP applications, but the NLP methods investigated are usually tailored to one specific phenotype and one institution, thus reducing portability and scalability. Moreover, while there has been much work in the processing of clinical texts, other genres of health texts, like narratives and posts authored by health consumers and patients, are lacking solutions to marshal and make sense of the health information they contain. Robust NLP solutions that answer the needs of biomedicine and health in general have not been fully investigated yet. A unified, data-science approach to health NLP enables the exploration of methods and solutions unprecedented up to now.  Our vision is to unravel the information buried in the health narratives by advancing text-processing methods in a unified way across all the genres of texts. The crosscutting theme is the investigation of methods for health NLP (hNLP) made possible by big data, fused with health knowledge. Our proposal moves the field into exploring semi-supervised and fully unsupervised methods, which only succeed when very large amounts of data are leveraged and knowledge is injected into the methods with care. Our hNLP proposal also targets a key challenge of current hNLP research: the lack of shared software. We seek to provide a clearinghouse for software created under this proposal, and as such all developed tools will be disseminated. Starting from the data characteristics of health texts and information needs of stakeholders, we will develop and evaluate methods for information extraction, information understanding. We will translate our research into the publicly available NLP software platform cTAKES, through robust modules for extraction and understanding across all genres of health texts. We will also demonstrate impact of our methods and tools through several use cases, ranging from clinical point of care to public health, to translational and precision medicine, to participatory medicine. Finally, we will disseminate our work through community activities, such as challenges to advance the state of the art in health natural language processing.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to unravel valuable information from these large data streams with the goal to advance medicine and the wellbeing of patients.

"Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health information technology (HIT) can lower costs, strengthen productivity, and promote safety. To realize such benefits on a large scale, healthcare organizations (HCOs) are adopting electronic health records (EHRs) to provide various capabilities. Yet, as EHRs and the healthcare workforce grow in diversity, so does their complexity. This is a concern because evidence suggests complex HIT can interrupt care delivery, contribute to medical errors, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. Moreover, such events tend to be discovered only after they transpire en masse, leading to negative media coverage, loss of patients' trust, and sanctions. Federal regulations now enable patients to receive accountings of who accessed their medical records during treatment, payment, and operations related activities. Yet, for patients to make sense of such accountings, they need to be provided with explanations regarding the extent to which accesses are normal in the context of routine HCO activities. We believe that relating specific accesses to patterns of healthcare operations can help explain how medical records are utilized. Unfortunately, many of the aforementioned problems manifest because EHR utilization patterns rarely guide the design and refinement of healthcare management practices. Thus, the overarching objective of our research is to develop novel strategies to automatically learn HCO behavior based on EHR usage. The past several years has witnessed a flurry of activity in this field, but it remains in is infancy and has only scratched the surface of care patterns and the types of anomalies that can be detected. Through this project, we propose to develop anomaly detection methods that integrate the semantics of healthcare operations and allow for the detection of workflows over time. This will enable HCOs and patients to audit in a meaningful way. Moreover, we believe the innovation and dissemination of such data mining strategies will enable HCOs to detect anomalous events that indicate system misuse and patients who require special attention, but also effectively audit business practices and discover inefficient workflows. The specific aims of this project are (1) to develop machine learning approaches, based on intrasession utilization patterns, to streamline EHR interface configuration and detect anomalous sessions, (2) to design a data mining framework, based on intersession EHR access patterns, to characterize HCO departmental interactions in patient treatment and detect anomalous events, and (3) to infer patient management pathways to consolidate redundant processes and detect deviations from anticipated workflows. In support of these goals, we will evaluate, compare, and contrast the workflows and anomalies in the EHR systems of two large medical centers. Additionally, we will ensure that our methods are integrated into an open source software system that can assist HCOs to extract, transform, and load (ETL) access data from EHRs, analyze such data for anomalies, and visualize the results in interfaces that enable review by healthcare administrators and patients. In doing so, we will be able to compare and contrast behavior of the workflows and multiple institutions and develop methods that appropriately generalize across EHR systems. As electronic health record systems, and healthcare organizations, grow in diversity, so do their complexity, which can lead to inefficient documentation, management of patients, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. In this research, we will develop technologies, to be disseminated through an open source software suite, to learn patterns associated with healthcare operations, upon which anomaly detection techniques can be based. The specific goals of this project are to 1) model HCO users' intrasession behaviors when interacting with an EHR, 2) learn interdepartmental relations based on the accesses of common patients, and 3) infer patient management pathways based on the sequence of accesses to a patient's record.",Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records,9332474,R01LM010207,"['Administrator', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Interdepartmental Relations', 'Interruption', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Neonatal Intensive Care', 'Neonatology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Patterns of Care', 'Phase', 'Practice Management', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'comparative', 'cost', 'data access', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health information technology', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'payment', 'programs', 'software systems', 'ward', 'web portal']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,341475,0.023998319068527427
"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm.

"Developing Evidence- based User Centered Design and Implementation Guidelines to Improve Health Information Technology Usability ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to provide an evidence-base to better inform user centered design and implementation processes to improve health information technology (health IT) usability and safety. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-15-005). Utilizing a hybrid approach of expert manual review and machine learning techniques, specifically natural language processing, we will develop methods to rapidly analyze patient safety event data to determine which events are health IT related. We will then further categorize the health IT related safety events to determine which events could have been prevented by effective usability or implementation processes. Through this analysis we will be able to specify the usability and implementation processes that are critical to the safe and effective use of health IT. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health IT, and computer science. The proposed research is based on unique insights that our team gleaned from previous research that we conducted focusing on health IT vendor design and implementation processes. The application addresses fundamental aspects of the call for applications by providing an evidence base to improve health IT usability and safety to better inform policy and practice.

"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",9332464,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'tool', 'trend analysis']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2017,335217,0.03690607077009792
"Optimal Methods for Notifying Clinicians about Epilepsy Surgery Patients Project Summary Epilepsy is one of the leading neurological disorders in the United States, affecting more than 479,000 children and over 2 million adults. Approximately 30% of epileptic patients have poor seizure control despite antiepileptic medications and are potential candidates for neurosurgical intervention. Early identification and referral of children who are potential surgical candidates is complex and while relevant guidelines exist, there is no standard process to efficiently identify those patients meeting criteria for neurosurgical intervention. Given the large corpus of note-based data available in the electronic health record (EHR), it is challenging for providers to efficiently retain and process all the pertinent patient information. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques have been successfully used to evaluate clinical notes and make recommendations in the research setting. However, NLP techniques are rarely integrated into practice to provide real-time clinical decision support. We developed and retrospectively evaluated a NLP system to help identify those patients who meet neurosurgical criteria and therefore enable surgical consults and evaluations to occur sooner. Knowing clinical decision support can improve outcomes of care, our proposed research will implement NLP into clinical practice and develop a decision support mechanism to improve the time to surgery for eligible patients. The objective of this project is to implement NLP directly into clinical care and determine the most effective decision support mechanism for provider adherence to epilepsy surgical consult recommendations. The long- term goal of this project is to reduce the time to initial surgery evaluation for patients with intractable epilepsy by integrating NLP-classification criteria into clinical practice. This project is one of the first in the field to study the integration of NLP recommendations into clinical care. We will use a human factors engineering framework to design and to analyze two different alerting methodologies for the best-fit for clinical workflow to produce the optimum provider adherence while reducing alert fatigue. Epilepsy progress notes can be classified across hospitals, and if successful, the system will be implemented in additional pediatric institutions around the United States. Project Narrative Epilepsy affects more than 479,000 children; 30% of those are not controlled with medication and may require surgery. We developed a novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm that can be integrated into neurology practice to detect patients who may be eligible for epilepsy surgical consults. Once implemented, this research can help to drive successful implementations of NLP and identify and use ideal alerting mechanisms in neurological care.",Optimal Methods for Notifying Clinicians about Epilepsy Surgery Patients,9355161,R21HS024977,[' '],AHRQ,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2017,159334,-0.04021396988670348
"Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records ABSTRACT This Career Development Application describes targeted coursework and mentored research for progression to independent research in the use of electronic health record data for disease subtyping. Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Use of natural language processing techniques has enabled computational analysis of specific terms found in free text clinical notes. An improved ability to extract symptom information from clinical notes would improve researchers’ ability to use de-identified data from patient records for discovery of disease subtypes. Symptom-related terms are particularly important in the context of mental health, but also harder to detect in notes than other terms like diseases or drug names.  The research aims of this proposal present a novel approach to scalable extension of biomedical terminologies and improved detection of those terms and their modifiers (e.g. severe, familial, absent). The richer dataset that can be extracted using these enhanced approaches is then used to define patient cohorts and to detect disease subtypes and predictors of response to specific pharmaceutical intervention.  Resulting patient stratification will be compared to groupings made without the enriched data and validated on an independent data set. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that enhanced mining of clinical notes will enable statistically significant and clinically relevant symptom-based stratification of psychiatric disorders. In order to test this hypothesis, I will: Aim 1: Develop a semi-automated pipeline for domain-specific terminology extension Aim 2: Define and stratify patient cohorts through use of enhanced term extraction Aim 3: Evaluate the validity and utility of the richer set of data obtained through Aims 1 and 2  One area of greatest need for more evidence-based disease stratification, and also of greatest challenge for a number of reasons, is that of mental health. Mental health disorders account for 30% of non-fatal disease burden world-wide, and pose an economic burden of trillions of dollars and climbing. Moreover, mental health symptoms are generally subjective and self-reported, with few objectively measurable signs. The impact of this proposal is that it will dramatically improve our ability to use EHR data to stratify patients in this drastically underserved area of health and healthcare.  The major innovations of this project are the adaptation and application of a semi-supervised pattern learning pipeline to augment mental health terminologies, and a novel approach to disease stratification using a significantly underutilized source of biomedical data, namely clinical notes.  This work addresses a major challenge for mining clinical notes in rapidly evolving biomedical domains and leverages a valuable source of medical evidence that is largely untapped and underutilized. Together, these methods for enhanced use of clinical notes will enable identification of distinct patient subgroups using data that is sitting idle in EHRs. Project Narrative Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Natural language processing has enabled the use of information from clinical notes in addition to structured data like diagnoses and lab values.

"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research.

Combining and integrating the complimentary expertise of informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, we propose a U24 Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) to support and inform the other COMpAAAS components. This resource will address the complex challenges required to maximize power and minimize bias in analyses addressing consortium-wide questions. Advanced informatics methods supported include natural language processing (NLP), ontologies, database and clinical decision support, and application of vital data management tools for secure data collection, storage, annotation, retrieval, and integration. Advanced epidemiological and statistical methods include time-updated exposure techniques, multiple imputation, propensity score techniques, measurement error correction, and competing risks regression. Routine, but essential, statistical methods include Cox proportional hazards, logistic and linear regression, goodness of fit diagnostics, and agreement/accuracy metrics (kappa, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). The RIB will further leverage the observational and interventional studies, simulation models, and well-coordinated network of cores and workgroups of COMpAAAS with advanced informatics and biostatistical techniques tailored to the particular challenges of large scale, longitudinal data from multiple sources including electronic health records (EHR), clinical interventions, patient self-report, and tissue repositories. Our specific aims are to provide 1) statistical and 2) informatics expertise for COMpAAAS to maximize scientific impact. To accomplish this, we will enhance the design, recruitment, and follow-up of intervention studies, support appropriate design and execution of data analyses and cross cohort collaborations, provide advanced statistical methods plus estimates of alcohol patterns for OR modeling and identify sexual/gender minority populations (CHAMP) from VACS survey data.

"Community Surveillance of Coronary Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract  Preventing the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its recurrence, and reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with AMI, remain of significant public health and clinical concern. Monitoring contemporary trends in AMI incidence, treatment, and in-hospital and long-term outcomes is of considerable importance given periodic national updates of treatment guidelines, emphasis on reducing hospital readmissions, and revised definitions and classifications of AMI. Continuously supported by the NHLBI, we have conducted more than 35 years of population-based surveillance of AMI incidence and attack rates, hospital management practices, and the in-hospital and long-term prognosis associated with AMI among residents of central MA hospitalized at all central MA medical centers. We have a highly experienced team of cardiologists, epidemiologists, clinical informatics, and health services researchers who will build on multi- decade long trends (1975-2011) in our principal study endpoints examined previously in this study to the two new study years of patients hospitalized with AMI at all central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017.  To sustain our efforts into the era of electronic medical records (EMRs), and after implementation of the ICD-10 system in 2015, we will develop a new automated AMI surveillance system that efficiently utilizes EMRs by taking advantage of state-of-art natural language processing (NLP) methods that will be compatible with ICD-10 (Aim 1). We will use the new NLP method to streamline traditional chart review-based collection of socio-demographic, clinical, treatment, and hospital and post-discharge outcomes data in patients hospitalized with AMI at all 11 central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017. The data extracted from NLP-streamlined chart reviews will be used to validate and refine the NLP system. Issues related to changes from ICD-9 to ICD- 10 will be carefully addressed. The new NLP-enriched EMR-based surveillance system will eventually be implemented in all participating central MA hospitals. Using the NLP-enriched and EMR-based surveillance data, we will monitor the contemporary clinical epidemiology of AMI, and out-of-hospital deaths due to coronary disease, and changing landscape, over a more than 40 year period (1975-2017) (Aim 2).  The new EMR-based and NLP-enriched system will enhance the population-based surveillance of acute coronary disease. This new system will be cost-effective, more efficient and near-real time, have greater accuracy and precision, and can be readily updated to accommodate changes in information technologies and broadly applicable to other hospital systems. It will support our continued efforts to provide unique community- based observational data on several populations that are often excluded from clinical trials, and that are increasing in numbers, namely the elderly and patients with multiple morbidities. Furthermore, it will generate critical data to inform more national clinical guidelines on the enhanced prevention and management of AMI. If successful, the system can serve as a model and be implemented statewide in MA and elsewhere in the US. Project Narrative  The results of the proposed community-based study will provide data about 40 year trends with regards to the changing magnitude of, and outcomes associated with, heart attacks in residents of a large central New England community.

"How Does Automated Record Linkage Affect Inferences about Population Health? ABSTRACT  Our broad research objective is to create the Longitudinal Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-dataset (LIFE-M) spanning the late 19th and 20th century United States. Using automated record linkage technology, the LIFE-M project combines millions of vital records to reconstruct how and why individuals' health has changed across time. This multi-generational, longitudinal micro-database aims to transform research on health and longevity, on childbearing and family structure, and on the long-run health effects of early-life circumstances and exposures.  In creating LIFE-M, however, we have encountered serious deficits in knowledge about the performance of automated record linkage technology. The proposed project seeks to evaluate the performance of the most popular and cutting-edge automated linking techniques for the purposes of creating longitudinal health data. Our specific aims are to (1) produce systematic evidence regarding the performance of automated record linking algorithms in terms of match rates, representativeness of the linked sample, erroneous matches (type I errors), and systematic measurement error; (2) examine how phonetic name-cleaning methods affect quality metrics; and (3) examine how record quality metrics vary for different underrepresented subgroups (including women, racial/ethnic minorities, and immigrants) and to determine how linking methods affect representativeness and inferences. To achieve these aims, we have developed new partnerships with record linking experts allowing us to incorporate the most cutting-edge methods in record linking. We will also rely on new “ground truth” generated by LIFE-M project's independent, double-blind human review process.  This project will contribute significantly to existing knowledge about the use of automated linking methods for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health data. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in health studies. Both contributions should greatly enhance the quality of descriptive and causal inferences about population health and aging and disparities in these outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by advancing record linking methodology for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health datasets.

"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care.

"Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (L-EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. It learns how to do so by analyzing patterns of patient data access f many physicians in many past cases in the EMR, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant for making clinical decisions in a given patient.      The hypothesis underlying this research is that the L-EMR system will have sufficiently high precision and recall in highlighting relevant data, decrease the average time to assess an intensive care unit (ICU) patient case, and be judged by critical care medicine (CCM) physicians to be clinically useful.    The first aim of this project is develop a highly-usable L-EMR user interface. The L-EMR user interface will include zoomable time-series displays of lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. Usability studies of the L-EMR user interface will guide revisions and enhancements.      The second aim of the project is to train statistical models that can be applied to a patient case to predict relevant lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will enlist CCM physicians to review a set of retrospective ICU patient cases on a focused set of clinical conditions. Participants will review these cases as if they were active patients, identifying relevant lab- results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will train and evaluate statistical models to predict relevant data, and identify the best performing algorithm to include in the L-EMR system.      The third aim of the project is to evaluate the L-EMR system. We will recruit CCM physicians to evaluate an L-EMR system based on user interfaces from Aim 1 and statistical models trained using the best performing algorithm in Aim 2 to highlight relevant data items. We will measure the precision and recall of the data-highlighting functionality for assessing patient cases and making clinical decisions (e.g., lab and medication orders), the time required to assess cases with and without the highlighting, and physicians' assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the L-EMR system.    If the results of these experiments are positive, as anticipated, this project will introduce a computational method that has significant potential to improve future EMR systems and enhance patient care. Narrative The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. The system works by analyzing patterns of EMR usage of physicians, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant in a given patient.

"NLP to Improve Accuracy and Quality of Dictated Medical Documents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Errors in medical documents represent a critical issue that can adversely affect healthcare quality and safety. Physician use of speech recognition (SR) technology has risen in recent years due to its ease of use and efficiency at the point of care. However, high error rates, upwards of 10-23%, have been observed in SR-generated medical documents. Error correction and content editing can be time consuming for clinicians. A solution to this problem is to improve accuracy through automated error detection using natural language processing (NLP). In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) build a large corpus of clinical documents dictated via SR across different healthcare institutions and clinical settings; 2) conduct error analysis to estimate the prevalence and severity of SR errors; 3) develop innovative methods based on NLP for automated error detection and correction and create a comprehensive knowledge base that contains confusion sets, error frequencies and other error patterns; 4) evaluate the performance of the proposed methods and tool; and 5) distribute our methods and findings to make them available to other researchers.  We believe this application aligns with AHRQ's HIT and Patient Safety portfolios as well as AHRQ's Special Emphasis Notice to support projects to generate new evidence on health IT system safety (NOT- HS-15-005).

Physician use of speech recognition technology, a computerized form of medical transcription, has risen in recent years due to its ease of use and efficiency. However, high error rates, upwards of 10-23%, have been observed. The goal of this study is two-fold: 1) to study the nature of such errors and how they may affect the quality of care and 2) to develop innovative methods based on computerized natural language processing to automatically detect these errors in clinical documents so that physicians can correct the documents before entering them into the patient's medical record.",NLP to Improve Accuracy and Quality of Dictated Medical Documents,9352296,R01HS024264,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2017,249995,0.03627840011046744
"NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department Summary Timely identification of relevant or “need to know” clinical information about a patient’s history in the acute care setting can be critical for patient safety and medical decision-making. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. Currently, it is estimated that over 50% of the EHR is free-text. EHR search tools today are often inefficient, simplistic, and unable to rank or evoke the relevance of information for a particular problem or complaint. This is compounded by the fact that EHRs are amassing clinical information at an exponential rate. While the benefits of having a wealth of information at a provider’s fingertips seem obvious, the time and energy cost of culling through enormous amounts of data creates new issues of decreased efficiency and information overload for providers seeking to identify the most pertinent and relevant information about their patients. In the emergency department, where patients can present with life threatening conditions, timely unlocking of clinically relevant information for a patient’s problem or complaint at the point of care can be critical to medical decision-making and patient safety. In this study, we plan to address this challenge through the development of a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information based on the patients presenting complaint. We will accomplish this through the following specific aims: 1) identify and define complaint- specific information elements within a patient’s history and 2) develop and test an NLP-based information retrieval tool. Narrative Patient safety hinges on having right information about the right patient and the right time. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information from EHRs that providers rely upon to make medical decisions for their patients. This study comes at an important time where data in the EHRs is increasing at an exponential rate, creating a new problem for clinicians, that of finding all the relevant information for patient’s particular problem. This is particularly true in the emergency department setting where providers have limited if any prior relationship and often have to make quick decisions for patients with life threatening conditions. This search tool will provide a snapshot of clinically relevant information that the providers can view alongside the structured information already in the EHR. We believe this approach has the potential to increase clinician efficiency, decrease healthcare costs by avoiding duplicate diagnostic tests, and provide clinicians with the tools they need to make well-informed medical decisions, thereby improving patient safety and reducing suffering.",NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department,9342692,R21HS024541,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R21,2017,148922,0.03427909080317217
"Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical error is one of the leading causes of death in the US. The study and reduction of medical errors have become a major concern in healthcare today. It is believed that medical error reporting systems could be a good resource to share and to learn from errors if medical error data are collected in a properly structured format and are useful for the detection of patterns, discovery of underlying factors, and generation of solutions. Effectively gathering information from previous lessons and timely informing the subsequent action are the two major goals for the design, development and utilization of such a system. The Common Formats (CFs) suggested by AHRQ tend to unify the future reporting format, which holds promise in improving data consistency and reducing unsafe conditions through lessons learned. However, effective gathering medical incident data does not merely rely on a unified structure. To be able to learn from previous lessons, it heavily depends upon the quality reports and learning features offered by systems. Medical incident data are always the key components and invaluable assets in patient safety research. The long term goal of the project is to understand the occurrence and causes of medical incidents in real practice and to develop interventions based on collection of incident reports to minimize the recurrence of similar incidents that have been reported. The objective of this application is to improve the utilization f voluntary reporting systems that each healthcare institution has been put in use by developing a learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, automatically link historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews in patient safety. As moving toward CFs, the researchers propose a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach that will help reporters generate complete and accurate reports through user-friendly guidance and offer timely comments and relevant peer reviews through educational tools during and after incident reporting. The researchers employ a case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the knowledge-based toolkit which helps reporters improve the communication about patient safety through clear working definitions and advance training that builds knowledge about the safety culture and then provides continuing education through the system. The project holds promise in revolutionizing the design of voluntary medical incident reporting systems from an incident data repository to an advanced resource promoting complete and accurate incident reporting and learning toward a just and learning culture. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Timely reporting and effective learning from medical incidents is considered an effective way in developing strategies for reducing medical errors. Utilizing an innovative a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach combining with case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques, we propose to develop a knowledgebase and learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, linking historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews on patient safety.

"National Infrastructure for Standardized and Portable EHR Phenotyping Algorithms PROJECT SUMMARY With the rapidly growing adoption of patient electronic health record systems (EHRs) due to Meaningful Use, and linkage of EHRs to research biorepositories, evaluating the suitability of EHR data for clinical and translational research is becoming ever more important, with ramifications for genomic and observational research, clinical trials, and comparative effectiveness studies. A key component for identifying patient cohorts in the EHR is to define inclusion and exclusion criteria that algorithmically select sets of patients based on stored clinical data. This process is commonly referred to, as “EHR-driven phenotyping” is time-consuming and tedious due to the lack of a widely accepted and standards-based formal information model for defining phenotyping algorithms. To address this overall challenge, the proposed project will design, build and promote an open-access community infrastructure for standards-based development and sharing of phenotyping algorithms, as well as provide tools and resources for investigators, researchers and their informatics support staff to implement and execute the algorithms on native EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of patient cohorts for clinical and genomic research is a costly and time-consuming process. This bottleneck adversely affects public health by delaying research findings, and in some cases by making research costs prohibitively high. To address this issue, leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) for identifying patient cohorts has become an increasingly attractive option.

"Automated Problem and Allergy Lists Enrichment Based on High Accuracy Information Extraction from the Electronic Health Record ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical errors are recognized as the cause of numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many are preventable. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information in the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of the information available in the EHR is only mentioned in narrative clinical documents. Electronic lists of problems and allergies are available in most EHRs, but they require manual management by their users, to add new problems, modify existing ones, and the removal of the ones that are irrelevant. Consequently, these electronic lists are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. Clinacuity, Inc. proposed a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the EHR of patients suffering from cancer, and established its feasibility. To advance this new system from a prototype to an accurate, adaptable, and robust system, integrated into the commercial EHR system used in our implementation and testing site (Huntsman Cancer Institute and University of Utah Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah), and ready for commercialization efforts, we will work on the following aims: 1) enhance the NLP system performance, scalability, and quality, 2) develop an advanced visualization interface for local adaptation of the NLP system, and 3) integrate the NLP system with a commercial EHR system. A large and varied reference standard for training and testing the information extraction application will also be developed, a reference standard including a random sample of de-identified clinical narratives from patients treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute and at the University of Utah Hospital (Salt Lake City, Utah), with problems and allergies annotated by domain experts. Commercial application: The system Clinacuity proposes will not only help healthcare providers maintain complete and timely lists of problems and allergies, providing them with an efficient overview of a patient, but also help healthcare organizations attain meaningful use requirements. The proposed system has potential commercial applications in inpatient and outpatient settings, increasing the efficiency of busy healthcare providers by saving time, and aiding healthcare organizations in demonstrating ""meaningful use"" and obtaining Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services incentive payments. Clinacuity will further extend the commercial potential of the system and its output, using modular design principles allowing utilization of each module independently, and enhancing its local adaptability for easier deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical errors cause numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many could be prevented. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information such as entries in electronic lists of problems and allergies. Such lists are available in most electronic health records, but they require manual management and are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. On the other hand, clinical text reports contain the majority of the patient information, including problems and allergies.

"Informatics Tools for Pharmacogenomic Discovery using Practice-based Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for observational research. More recently, huge efforts have linked EMR databases with archived biological material, to accelerate research in personalized medicine. EMR- linked DNA biobanks have identified common and rare genetic variants that contribute to risk of disease. An appealing vision, which has not been extensively explored, is to use EMRs-linked biobanks for pharmacogenomic studies, which identify associations between genetic variation and drug efficacy and toxicity. The longitudinal nature of the data contained within EMRs make them ideal for quantifying drug outcome (both efficacy and toxicity). Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large-scale studies of treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. Despite its success, EMR-based pharmacogenomic studies are often hampered by its data-intensive nature -- it is time- consuming and costly to extract and integrate data from multiple heterogeneous EMR databases, for large-scale pharmacogenomic studies. The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) is a National Center for Biomedical Computing based at Partners Healthcare System. I2b2 has developed a scalable informatics framework to enable clinical researchers to repurpose existing EMR data for clinical and genomic discovery. In this study, we will collaborate with i2b2 to extend its informatics framework to the pharmacogenomics domain, by proposing the following specific aims: 1) Develop new methods to extract and model drug exposure and outcome information from EMR and integrate them with the i2b2 NLP components; 2) Build ontology tools to normalize and integrate pharmacogenomic data across different sites; 3) Conduct known and novel pharmacogenomic studies to evaluate and refine tools developed in Aim 1 and 2; and 4) Disseminate the developed informatics tools among pharmacogenomic researchers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Longitudinal electronic medical records (EMRs) linked with DNA biobanks have become valuable resources for genomic and pharmacogenomics research, allowing identification of associations between genetic variations and drug efficacy and toxicity. The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), a National Center for Biomedical Computing based at Partners Healthcare System, has developed a scalable informatics framework to enable clinical researchers to use existing EMR data for genomic knowledge discovery of diseases.

"Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: The reports of side effects on clinical trials describe expected toxicities of chemotherapy. However, these side effects, also called adverse events, are globally under-reported on trials, which means that clinicians do not have an accurate sense of adverse event rates. In the current system, adverse events are identified through time-consuming, manual medical record review. This study aims to develop a system that uses electronic medical record data to capture complex adverse events of chemotherapy for pediatric cancer and to prove that this method is more accurate than the current adverse event reporting system. The specific aims of this application are to 1) develop algorithms to identify 10 complex adverse events using electronic medical record data from children treated for acute leukemia at two large children's hospitals, 2) compare the accuracy of this new method to that of the current system, and 3) demonstrate the utility of electronic adverse event capture in answering clinical questions by defining the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury. Methods: This study will use data from 1900 children with acute leukemia treated at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) or the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) from 2002 through 2017. Algorithms will be developed to identify adverse events by extracting electronic medical record data at CHOP. Once finalized, the algorithms will be tested at TCH. Using chart abstraction data as the gold standard, the accuracy of electronic ascertainment and of trial adverse event reports will determined, and the relative accuracy of each method will be compared. Lastly, algorithms will extract creatinine results from the electronic medical record and the incidence of acute kidney injury will be determined for each leukemia type and by chemotherapy regimen. Risk factors for acute kidney injury will be explored. Career Goals and Environment: With the support of this K07 award, the applicant, Tamara P. Miller, MD, MSCE, will learn how to use electronic medical record data for clinical research, obtain formal training in clinical informatics and implementation science, develop expertise in clinical trial design, and improve her knowledge of pediatric oncology and skills in scientific writing. To complete these training goals, Dr. Miller has assembled an experienced, complementary, and nurturing mentoring team led by her primary mentor, Richard Aplenc, MD, PhD. Her training plan includes formal coursework in informatics, tutorials, national conferences, and research progress and writing groups. She will benefit from the outstanding depth of resources and opportunities at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania. Her long-term goal is to integrate the novel system of adverse event ascertainment she creates into pediatric oncology trials and to use the accurate datasets she develops to answer clinically important questions. With this award, Dr. Miller will be well-positioned to transition to her goal of an independent clinical research career focused on improving adverse event reporting and supportive care practices in pediatric oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with cancer experience significant side effects from their treatments, but these side effects are under- reported on clinical trials and no work has been done to improve the current system of side effect reporting. This study will create a new system of identifying and reporting side effects that is more accurate and efficient than the current system. The results of this research will provide clinicians, patients and their families with a true understanding of potential side effects of therapies used to treat childhood cancer.",Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials,9452250,K07CA211956,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Acute leukemia', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Child', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nephrotoxic', 'Oncology Group', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxicity due to chemotherapy', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'leukemia', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K07,2017,169044,0.003315425406600145
"Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing deployments of electronic health records (EHRs) systems have made massive clinical data available electronically. However, much of detailed clinical information of patients is embedded in narrative text and is not directly accessible for computerized clinical applications. Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information in narrative document, have received great attention in the medical domain. Current state-of-the-art NLP approaches often involve building probabilistic models. However, the wide adoption of statistical methods in clinical NLP faces two grand challenges: 1) the lack of large annotated clinical corpora; and 2) the lack of methodologies that can efficiently integrate linguistic and domain knowledge with statistical learning. High-performance statistical NLP methods rely on large scale and high quality annotations of clinical text, but it is time-consuming and costly to create large annotated clinica corpora as it often requires manual review by physicians. Moreover, the medical domain is knowledge intensive. To achieve optimal performance, probabilistic models need to leverage medical domain knowledge. Therefore, methods that can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost would be highly desirable for clinical text processing.    In this study, we propose to investigate interactive machine learning (IML) methods to address the above challenges in clinical NLP. An IML system builds a classification model in an iterative process, which can actively select informative samples for annotation based on models built on previously annotated samples, thus reducing the annotation cost for model development. More importantly, an IML system also involves human inputs to the learning process (e.g., an expert can specify important features for a classification task based on domain knowledge). Thus, IML is an ideal framework for efficiently integrating rule-based (via domain experts specifying features) and statistics-based (via different learning algorithms) approaches to clinical NLP. To achieve our goal, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we plan to investigate different aspects of IML for word sense disambiguation, including developing new active learning algorithms and conducting cognitive usability analysis for efficient feature annotation by users. To demonstrate the broad uses of IML, we further extend IML approaches to two other important clinical NLP classification tasks: named entity recognition and clinical phenoytping in Aim 2. Finally we propose to disseminate the IML methods and tools to the biomedical research community in Aim 3. Project Narrative In this project, we propose to develop interactive machine learning methods to process clinical text stored in electronic health records (EHRs) systems. Such methods can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost, thus improving performance of text processors. This technology will allow more accurate data extraction from clinical documents, thus to facilitate clinical research that rely on EHRs data.",Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing,9132834,R01LM010681,"['Abbreviations', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'computerized', 'cost', 'experience', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model building', 'model development', 'novel', 'open source', 'real world application', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2016,463405,0.023285481475899077
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems. The resulting symptom dimensions will allow better stratification of risk for clinically-important outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays and early readmissions.            ",Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology,9105846,R01MH106577,"['Admission activity', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Applaud', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Text', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'health data', 'health record', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'natural language', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2016,413500,0.013259541145525192
"Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have shown promise for extracting data from the free text of electronic health records (EHRs), but studies have consistently found that techniques do not readily generalize across application settings. Unfortunately, most of the focus in applying NLP to real use cases has remained on a paradigm of single, well-defined application settings, so that generalizability to unseen use cases remains implicitly unaddressed. We propose to explicitly account for unseen application settings by adopting an information retrieval (IR) perspective with the objective of patient-level cohort identification. To do so, we introduce layered language models, an IR framework that enables the reuse of NLP-produced artifacts. Our long term goal is to accelerate investigations of patient health and disease by providing robust, user- centric tools that are necessary to process, retrieve, and utilize the free text of EHRs. The main goal of this proposal is to accurately retrieve ad hoc, realistic cohorts from clinical text at Mayo Clinic and OHSU, establishing methods, resources, and evaluation for patient-level IR. We hypothesize that cohort identification can be addressed in a generalizable fashion by a new IR framework: layered language models. We will test this hypothesis through four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will make medical NLP artifacts searchable in our layered language IR framework. This involves storing and indexing the NLP artifacts, as well as using statistical language models to retrieve documents based on text and its associated NLP artifacts. In Aim 2, we deal with the practical setting of ad hoc cohort identification, moving to patient-level (rather than document-level) IR. To accurately handle patient cohorts in which qualifying evidence may be spread over multiple documents, we will develop and implement patient-level retrieval models that account for cross- document relational and temporal combinations of events. In Aim 3, we will construct parallel IR test collections using EHR data from two sites; a diverse set of cohort queries written by multiple people toward various clinical or epidemiological ends; and assessments of which patients are relevant to which queries at both sites. Finally, in Aim 4, we refine and evaluate patient-level layered language IR on the ad hoc cohort identification task, making comparisons across the users, queries, optimization metrics, and institutions. We will draw additional extrinsic comparisons with pre-existing techniques, e.g., for cohorts from the Electronic Medical Records and Genonmics network. The expected outcomes of the proposed work are: (i) An open-source cohort identification tool, usable by clinicians and epidemiologists, that makes principled use of NLP artifacts for unseen queries; ii) A parallel test collection for cohort identification, includig two intra-institutional document collections, diverse test topics and user-produced text queries, and patient-level judgments of relevance to each query; and (iii) Validation of the reusability of medical NLP via the task of retrieving patient cohorts.

Unfortunately, on top of lab tests, medications, and demographic information, there are observations that a physician writes down as text - which are difficult for a computer to understand. Therefore, we aim to process text so that a computer can understand enough of it, and then search that text along with the rest of a patient's medical record; this will allow clinicians or researchers to find and study patients groups of interest.",Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification,9115996,R01LM011934,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Asthma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Institution', 'Interest Group', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Smoke', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Writing', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'cohort', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'open source', 'profiles in patients', 'query optimization', 'syntax', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2016,387966,0.0529927541018058

"Natural language processing for clinical and translational research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for clinical and translational research. This growth is being fueled by recent federal legislation that provides generous financial incentives to institutions demonstrating aggressive application and ""meaningful use"" of comprehensive EMRs. Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large scale studies of disease onset and treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. However, a well-known challenge for secondary use of EMR data for clinical and translational research is that much of detailed patient information is embedded in narrative text. Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, which are able to convert unstructured clinical text into coded data, have been introduced into the biomedical domain and have demonstrated promising results. Researchers have used NLP systems to identify clinical syndromes and common biomedical concepts from radiology reports, discharge summaries, problem lists, nursing documentation, and medical education documents. Different NLP systems have been developed at different institutions and utilized to convert clinical narrative text into structured data that may be used for other clinical applications and studies. Successful stories in applying NLP to clinical and translational research have been reported widely. However, institutions often deploy different NLP systems, which produce various types of output formats and make it difficult to exchange information between sites. Therefore, the lack of interoperability among different clinical NLP systems becomes a bottleneck for efficient multi-site studies. In addition, many successful studies often require a strong interdisciplinary team where informaticians and clinicians have to work very closely to iteratively define optimal algorithms for clinical phenotypes. As intensive informatics support may not be available to every clinical researcher, the usability of NLP systems for end users is another important issue. The proposed project builds upon first-hand knowledge and experience across the research team in the use of NLP for clinical and translational research projects. There are several big informatics initiatives for clinical and translational research but those initiatives generally assume one shoe fits all and follow top-down approaches to develop NLP solutions. Complementary to those initiatives, we will use a bottom-up approach to handle interoperability and usability: i) we will obtain a common NLP data model and exchange format through empirical analysis of existing NLP systems and NLP results; ii) we will develop a user-centric NLP front end interface for NLP systems wrapped to be consistent with the proposed NLP data model and exchange format incorporating usability analysis into the agile development process. All deliverables will be distributed through the open health NLP (OHNLP) consortium which we intend to make it more open and inclusive.

"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data. This pioneering research directly impacts public health by improving the quality of care through enhanced reminder functionality in the EHRs.",A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications,9187058,R00LM011575,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Area', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Institution', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Reminder Systems', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Structure', 'System', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'open source', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R00,2016,251021,0.034332982799315154
"Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Supervised machine learning is a popular method that uses labeled training examples to predict future outcomes.  Unfortunately, supervised machine learning for biomedical research is often limited by a lack of labeled data.  Current methods to produce labeled data involve manual chart reviews that are laborious and do not scale with data creation rates.  This project aims to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records by forming a crowd of clinical personnel labelers.  The construction of these labeled data sets will allow for new biomedical research studies that were previously infeasible to conduct.  There are numerous practical and theoretical challenges of developing a crowd sourcing platform for clinical data.  First, popular, public crowd sourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk are not suitable for medical record labeling as HIPAA makes clinical data sharing risky.  Second, the types of clinical questions that are amenable for crowd sourcing are not well understood.  Third, it is unclear if the clinical crowd can produce labels quickly and accurately.  Each of these challenges will be addressed in a separate Aim. As the first Aim of this project, the team will evaluate different clinical crowd sourcing architectures.  The architecture must leverage the scale of the crowd, while minimizing patient information exposure.  De-identification tools will be considered to scrub clinical notes t reduce information leakage.  Using this design, the team will extend a popular open source crowd sourcing tool, Pybossa, and release it to the public.  As the second Aim, the team will study the type, structure, topic and specificity of clinical prediction questions, and how these characteristics impact labeler quality.  Lastly, the team will evaluate the quality and accuracy of collected clinical crowd sourced data on two existing chart review problems to determine the platform's utility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Traditionally, clinical prediction models rely on supervised machine learning algorithms to probabilistically predict clinical events using labeled medical records.  When data sets are small, manual chart reviews performed by clinical staff are sufficient to label each outcome; however, as data sets have scaled up and researchers aim to study larger cohorts, current manual approaches become intractable.  The goal of this proposal is to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records to support prediction model development.        ",Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research,9076555,UH2CA203708,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Biomedical Research', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Extravasation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Human Resources', 'Incentives', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Audit', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Research', 'Medical Students', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Privacy', 'Productivity', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'member', 'model development', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'tool']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH2,2016,316000,0.025535882347833404
"Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient information in the electronic health record (EHR) such as lab results, medications, and past medical history is the basis for physician decisions about patient care. It also helps patients better understand and manage their care. Efficient access to this patient information is thus essential. One of the most intuitive ways of accessing data is by asking natural language questions. A significant amount of work in medical question answering has been conducted, yet little work has been performed in question answering for EHRs. Natural language questions can be represented in logical forms, a standard structured knowledge representation technique. This project proposes to take natural language EHR questions, both for doctors and patients, and automatically convert them to a logical form. The logical forms can then be converted to a structured query such as those used by EHRs. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of data containing questions annotated with logical forms. This project hypothesizes that a small set of questions can be manually annotated, and then paraphrases can be produced for each annotated question. Since paraphrasing is a simpler task than logical form annotation, crowd-sourcing techniques can be used to collect thousands of question paraphrases. This question paraphrase corpus will then be used to build a semantic grammar capable of recognizing the logical structure of EHR questions. To ensure a robust, generalizable grammar, existing NLP techniques will be used to pre-process questions, simplifying their syntactic structure and abstracting their medical concepts.     In order to develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Kirk Roberts, requires additional training and mentoring in natural language processing and biomedical informatics. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Roberts to achieve the goals of this project as well as transition to a career as an independent researcher. He will be mentored by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, a leading medical NLP researcher, and co-mentored by Dr. Clement McDonald, a leading EHR and medical informatics researcher.     The specific aims of the project are: (1) Build a paraphrase collection of EHR questions, where each prototype question will have many unique paraphrases. The paraphrases encompass different lexical and syntactic means of conveying the same logical form. (2) Construct a semantic grammar for EHR questions. The grammar can then be used to convert a natural language question to a logical form. (3) Implement an end- to-end question analyzer that generalizes EHR questions for improved parsing, parses the question into a logical form using the grammar, and converts the logical form into a leading structured EHR query format. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work aims to significantly improve the ability of both doctors and patients to find information within electronic health records (EHR). By providing an interface to EHRs where users can specify their information needs in the form of a natural language question, the proposed work provides a more intuitive means of finding patient data than is currently available.",Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records,9228509,R00LM012104,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Blood Glucose', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'crowdsourcing', 'data access', 'database structure', 'design', 'health data', 'illiterate', 'improved', 'information organization', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'open source', 'operation', 'phrases', 'prototype', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2016,249000,0.03699169709486082
"Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Timely detection of severe patient conditions or concerning events and their mitigation remains an important problem in clinical practice. This is especially true in the critically ill patient. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming, costly, and difficult to extract and implement such knowledge in existing monitoring systems. The research work in this proposal offers computational, rather than expert-based, solutions that build alert systems from data stored in patient data repositories, such as electronic medical records. Briefly, our approach uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify unusual clinical management patterns in individual patients, relative to patterns associated with comparable patients, and raises an alert signaling this discrepancy. Our previous studies provide support that such deviations indicate clinically important events at false alert rates belo 50%, which is very promising. We propose to further improve the new methodology, and build a real-time monitoring and alerting system integrated with production electronic medical records. We propose an evaluation of the system using physicians' assessment of alerts raised by our real-time system for intensive-care unit (ICU) patient cases. The project investigators comprise a multidisciplinary team with expertise in critical care medicine, computer science, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, knowledge based systems, and clinical data repositories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors in the intensive care unit (ICU). This project develops and evaluates a new clinical monitoring and alerting framework that uses electronic medical records and machine-learning methods to send alerts concerning clinical decisions in the ICU that are unexpected given the clinical context and may represent medical errors.",Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams,9095389,R01GM088224,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electronics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Information Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Practice Management', 'Production', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stream', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'data archive', 'design', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'liver transplantation', 'multidisciplinary', 'prototype']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,548500,0.02317893775877909
"Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that optimal treatment is not the same for every patient - it depends on the individual patient's circumstances. One important factor that determines the optimal clinical management is the patient's life expectancy, which determines the temporal horizon within which medical decisions have to operate. For example, while adding an extra diabetes medication may save a 40-year-old individual from going blind or developing kidney failure 20 years later, it will not bring any benefits to an 80-yer old with a metastatic malignancy who is expected to live only a few months.  Consequently, it is critical that when we measure quality of care, suggest treatment options to clinicians through clinical decision support or compare different treatment strategies, we take into account the patient's life expectancy. However, currently there are no methods available that can do this with sufficient accuracy.  Most commonly used techniques to assess a patient's mortality risk draw primarily on administrative data and other structured data fields in electronic medical records. This approach leaves out a large amount of information that is only available in narrative documents such as provider notes, radiology reports, etc. In this project we propose to test the hypothesis that application of two novel technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing (NLP) - could leverage the information in narrative electronic documents to significantly improve the accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.  Dynamic Logic allows to circumvent the challenge of combinatorial complexity that limits the number of variables and their combinations that can be considered as predictors of an outcome by most currently used analytical methods. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly increase the richness of the models for identification of patients with low life expectancy and ultimately improve their accuracy.  Information such as the patient's functional status that is usually only found in narrative documents may be critical to improving accuracy of identifying frail patients at high mortality risk. Modern NLP techniques can effectively identify key concepts in medical text but until now analytical methods allowed consideration of only a few of pre-selected concepts in prediction models. Combining NLP with Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly expand the number of concepts from narrative text that could be included in the life expectancy prediction model, likely leading to a considerable improvement in accuracy.  In the proposed translational multidisciplinary project our team that will include experts on artificial intelligence, natural language processing, analysis of data in electronic medical records, and geriatrics will test whether a combination of Dynamic Logic and NLP improves identification of patients at high risk of death. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identification of patients with limited life expectancy is important for accurate measurement of quality of care delivered by clinicians, clinical decision support in electronic medical records and research that compares different treatment options for patients. However, currently available methods suffer from low accuracy or use information that is not widely available. In this project we propose to combine two advanced computational technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing - to improve accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.",Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy,9115065,R01HS024090,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2016,227891,0.03754272021020816
"Utilizing social media as a resource for mental health surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major depressive disorder is one of the most common debilitating illnesses in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Currently, nationwide mental health surveillance takes the form of large-scale telephone- based surveys. These surveys have high running costs and require teams of human telephone operators. Even the largest system, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, reaches only 0.13% of the US population. Twitter (and other microblog services) offers a rich, if terse, multilingual source of real time data for public health surveillance. Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides techniques and resources to ""unlock"" data from text. We propose using Twitter and NLP as a cost-effective and flexible approach to augmenting current telephone- based surveillance methods for population level depression monitoring.         This grant application has two major strands. First, investigating ethical issues and challenges to privacy that emerge with the use of Twitter data for public health surveillance (Aim One). Second, developing techniques and resources for real-time public health surveillance for mental illness from Twitter (Aim Two &Aim Three). Aim One seeks to investigate and codify our responsibilities as researchers towards Twitter users by engaging with those users directly. With Aim Two, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing resources - algorithms, lexicons and taxonomies - to support the identification of depression symptoms in Twitter data. For Aim Three, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing modules and services that use Twitter as a data source for monitoring depression levels in the community. The significance of the proposed work lies in three areas. First, our investigations - both empirical and theoretical - will explore ethical issues in the use of Twitter for public health surveillance. This work has the potential to guide future research in the area. Second, in developing and evaluating algorithms and resources for identifying depression from tweets, we are contributing foundational work to the field of NLP. Third, developing these algorithms and resources will provide the bedrock for building social media based surveillance systems which will provide a cost effective means of augmenting current mental health surveillance practice. This proposal is innovative in both its application area (microblogs have not been used before for mental health surveillance), its focus on using NLP to identify depressive symptoms for public health, and in the central role that qualitative bioethical research will play in guiding the work. Project Narrative The proposed research focuses on using advanced Natural Language Processing methods to mine microblog data - in this case, Twitter - for mental health surveillance (specifically, depression surveillance), in order to augment current telephone-based mental health surveillance systems.

"Extended Methods and Software Development for Health NLP PROJECT SUMMARY There is a deluge of health-related texts in many genres, from the clinical narrative to newswire and social media. These texts are diverse in content, format, and style, and yet they represent complementary facets of biomedical and health knowledge. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to extract, understand, and distill valuable information from these overwhelming large and complex streams of data, with the ultimate goal to advance biomedicine and impact the health and wellbeing of patients. There have been a number of success stories in various biomedical NLP applications, but the NLP methods investigated are usually tailored to one specific phenotype and one institution, thus reducing portability and scalability. Moreover, while there has been much work in the processing of clinical texts, other genres of health texts, like narratives and posts authored by health consumers and patients, are lacking solutions to marshal and make sense of the health information they contain. Robust NLP solutions that answer the needs of biomedicine and health in general have not been fully investigated yet. A unified, data-science approach to health NLP enables the exploration of methods and solutions unprecedented up to now.  Our vision is to unravel the information buried in the health narratives by advancing text-processing methods in a unified way across all the genres of texts. The crosscutting theme is the investigation of methods for health NLP (hNLP) made possible by big data, fused with health knowledge. Our proposal moves the field into exploring semi-supervised and fully unsupervised methods, which only succeed when very large amounts of data are leveraged and knowledge is injected into the methods with care. Our hNLP proposal also targets a key challenge of current hNLP research: the lack of shared software. We seek to provide a clearinghouse for software created under this proposal, and as such all developed tools will be disseminated. Starting from the data characteristics of health texts and information needs of stakeholders, we will develop and evaluate methods for information extraction, information understanding. We will translate our research into the publicly available NLP software platform cTAKES, through robust modules for extraction and understanding across all genres of health texts. We will also demonstrate impact of our methods and tools through several use cases, ranging from clinical point of care to public health, to translational and precision medicine, to participatory medicine. Finally, we will disseminate our work through community activities, such as challenges to advance the state of the art in health natural language processing. PROJECT NARRATIVE  There is a deluge of health texts. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to unravel valuable information from these large data streams with the goal to advance medicine and the wellbeing of patients.

"Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health information technology (HIT) can lower costs, strengthen productivity, and promote safety. To realize such benefits on a large scale, healthcare organizations (HCOs) are adopting electronic health records (EHRs) to provide various capabilities. Yet, as EHRs and the healthcare workforce grow in diversity, so does their complexity. This is a concern because evidence suggests complex HIT can interrupt care delivery, contribute to medical errors, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. Moreover, such events tend to be discovered only after they transpire en masse, leading to negative media coverage, loss of patients' trust, and sanctions. Federal regulations now enable patients to receive accountings of who accessed their medical records during treatment, payment, and operations related activities. Yet, for patients to make sense of such accountings, they need to be provided with explanations regarding the extent to which accesses are normal in the context of routine HCO activities. We believe that relating specific accesses to patterns of healthcare operations can help explain how medical records are utilized. Unfortunately, many of the aforementioned problems manifest because EHR utilization patterns rarely guide the design and refinement of healthcare management practices. Thus, the overarching objective of our research is to develop novel strategies to automatically learn HCO behavior based on EHR usage. The past several years has witnessed a flurry of activity in this field, but it remains in is infancy and has only scratched the surface of care patterns and the types of anomalies that can be detected. Through this project, we propose to develop anomaly detection methods that integrate the semantics of healthcare operations and allow for the detection of workflows over time. This will enable HCOs and patients to audit in a meaningful way. Moreover, we believe the innovation and dissemination of such data mining strategies will enable HCOs to detect anomalous events that indicate system misuse and patients who require special attention, but also effectively audit business practices and discover inefficient workflows. The specific aims of this project are (1) to develop machine learning approaches, based on intrasession utilization patterns, to streamline EHR interface configuration and detect anomalous sessions, (2) to design a data mining framework, based on intersession EHR access patterns, to characterize HCO departmental interactions in patient treatment and detect anomalous events, and (3) to infer patient management pathways to consolidate redundant processes and detect deviations from anticipated workflows. In support of these goals, we will evaluate, compare, and contrast the workflows and anomalies in the EHR systems of two large medical centers. Additionally, we will ensure that our methods are integrated into an open source software system that can assist HCOs to extract, transform, and load (ETL) access data from EHRs, analyze such data for anomalies, and visualize the results in interfaces that enable review by healthcare administrators and patients. In doing so, we will be able to compare and contrast behavior of the workflows and multiple institutions and develop methods that appropriately generalize across EHR systems. As electronic health record systems, and healthcare organizations, grow in diversity, so do their complexity, which can lead to inefficient documentation, management of patients, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. In this research, we will develop technologies, to be disseminated through an open source software suite, to learn patterns associated with healthcare operations, upon which anomaly detection techniques can be based. The specific goals of this project are to 1) model HCO users' intrasession behaviors when interacting with an EHR, 2) learn interdepartmental relations based on the accesses of common patients, and 3) infer patient management pathways based on the sequence of accesses to a patient's record.",Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records,9143798,R01LM010207,"['Accounting', 'Administrator', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Interdepartmental Relations', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Neonatal Intensive Care', 'Neonatology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Patterns of Care', 'Phase', 'Practice Management', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'comparative', 'cost', 'data access', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health information technology', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'payment', 'programs', 'software systems', 'ward', 'web portal']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,341475,0.023998319068527427
"BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: DA: Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictions of Outcomes (C3PO) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An unsolved problem in health informatics is how to apply the past experiences of patients, stored in large-scale medical records systems, to predict the outcomes of patients and to individualize care. One approach to prediction, heretofore impractical, is rapidly finding a patient cohort ""similar enough"" to an index case that the health experiences and outcomes of this cohort are informative for prediction. This task is formidable because of large variability of the vast numbers of patient attributes with the added complexity of sequences of patient encounters evolving over time. Epidemiological considerations such as confounding by indication for treatment also come into play. The objective of this research effort is to (1) create a modular test bed that uses a ""big data"" systems architecture to support research in rapid individualized prediction of outcomes from large clinical repositories and (2) to explore various approaches to making ""pragmatic"" near-term predictions of outcomes. Using the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Informatics and Computing Infrastructure database (VINCI), a research database with records of tens of millions of patients, we will explore two synergistic strategies for rapidly finding a cohort of patients that are similar enough to an index patient to predict near-term treatment response and/or adverse effects in an elastic cloud environment: 1) use of temporal alignment of critical events including use of gene sequence alignment methods to relax requirements for exact temporal matching; and, 2) use of conceptual distance metrics to model the degree of content similarity of case records. The initial domain of application will be treatment of Type 2 diabetes. The approach will apply open source ""big data"" methodologies, including Hadoop and Accumulo, to store and filter ""medical log"" files.

"InfoMediator: Weaving Clinical Expertise in Online Health Communities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic illness can be overwhelming to patients because it impacts many areas of their daily lives. Accordingly, many patients turn to online health support groups to get social support. In face-to-face patient support groups (F2F), health professional moderators provide clinical expertise within the context of peer-patients' sharing of experience. However, in online health community settings, because health professionals' time and resources are expensive, it is challenging to get health professionals' opinions for thousands of messages posted each day. To solve this problem, I propose to develop methods and techniques that maximize the use of already available clinical expertise online for online peer-patient conversation threads by developing a system, InfoMediator. The InfoMediator will semi-automatically weave health professionals' existing answers to patients' questions into peer-patient conversations by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques complemented by user feedback. As the career development component of this proposal, I deepen my skills and knowledge in NLP necessary for proposed work and patient education. As I develop the NLP techniques and knowledge in patient education, I and my mentors will develop methods and techniques that address weaving clinical expertise within peer-patient conversations by designing, implementing, and evaluating socio-technical aspects of the InfoMediator. The training opportunities provided by this NIH NLM K01 grant, together with the supportive research environment at Michigan State University, will help further extend my existing expertise in human-computer interaction, design, and health informatics to establish my independent informatics research program in patient-centered technologies. Focusing on persons with diabetes, the outcomes of the proposed research will help us understand how to empower persons with diabetes to improve self- efficacy and self-care, while increasing the quality of online health information environment. 8. Project Narrative Because health professionals' time and resources are expensive, it is challenging for online health communities to engage health professionals in thousands of peer-patient conversations in the same way that health professionals moderate patient conversations in face-to-face patient support groups.

"Optimal Methods for Notifying Clinicians about Epilepsy Surgery Patients Project Summary Epilepsy is one of the leading neurological disorders in the United States, affecting more than 479,000 children and over 2 million adults. Approximately 30% of epileptic patients have poor seizure control despite antiepileptic medications and are potential candidates for neurosurgical intervention. Early identification and referral of children who are potential surgical candidates is complex and while relevant guidelines exist, there is no standard process to efficiently identify those patients meeting criteria for neurosurgical intervention. Given the large corpus of note-based data available in the electronic health record (EHR), it is challenging for providers to efficiently retain and process all the pertinent patient information. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques have been successfully used to evaluate clinical notes and make recommendations in the research setting. However, NLP techniques are rarely integrated into practice to provide real-time clinical decision support. We developed and retrospectively evaluated a NLP system to help identify those patients who meet neurosurgical criteria and therefore enable surgical consults and evaluations to occur sooner. Knowing clinical decision support can improve outcomes of care, our proposed research will implement NLP into clinical practice and develop a decision support mechanism to improve the time to surgery for eligible patients. The objective of this project is to implement NLP directly into clinical care and determine the most effective decision support mechanism for provider adherence to epilepsy surgical consult recommendations. The long- term goal of this project is to reduce the time to initial surgery evaluation for patients with intractable epilepsy by integrating NLP-classification criteria into clinical practice. This project is one of the first in the field to study the integration of NLP recommendations into clinical care. We will use a human factors engineering framework to design and to analyze two different alerting methodologies for the best-fit for clinical workflow to produce the optimum provider adherence while reducing alert fatigue. Epilepsy progress notes can be classified across hospitals, and if successful, the system will be implemented in additional pediatric institutions around the United States. Project Narrative Epilepsy affects more than 479,000 children; 30% of those are not controlled with medication and may require surgery. We developed a novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm that can be integrated into neurology practice to detect patients who may be eligible for epilepsy surgical consults. Once implemented, this research can help to drive successful implementations of NLP and identify and use ideal alerting mechanisms in neurological care.",Optimal Methods for Notifying Clinicians about Epilepsy Surgery Patients,9222109,R21HS024977,[' '],AHRQ,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2016,137233,-0.04021396988670348
"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",9115724,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'tool', 'trend analysis']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2016,335217,0.03690607077009792
"Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and healthcare, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring a huge cost. The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance  patient safety and reduce costs by discovering novel serious ADRs through use of automated methods that  combine information from large and varied patient populations as well as from the literature. There have been  considerable advances in pharmacovigilance, but more work is needed. For example, Vioxx, a commonly used  drug, was recently found to cause at least 88,000 occurrences of myocardial infarction, highlighting the  insufficiency of current methods. To date, methods have mainly depended on the use of single sources of data,  primarily from the Federal Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and from  electronic health records (EHRS). Although important, each of the sources has different limitations and  advantages, and therefore, combining the data across them should lead to more effective drug safety  surveillance by increasing the statistical power, and also by allowing each data source to complement the other  sources. We already have developed methods associated with each of the single sources, and therefore, this  is an excellent opportunity to build upon our research accomplishments to advance the state of the art in  pharmacovigilance.   More specifically, we will a) acquire and combine comprehensive clinical data from the electronic health  records (EHRs) of two different health care sites serving diverse populations by utilizing natural language  processing (NLP) to obtain vast quantities of fine-grained data, and then by developing data mining  methodologies on the clinical data to detect novel ADR signals, b) analyze differences in therapy-related risk  factors between the two EHR populations, such as racial and ethnic differences, c) detect ADR signals in the  FAERS database using an established methodology, d) develop improved methods to acquire ADR signals  based on information in the literature, and e) develop methods that utilize the results from the above sources to  maximize effectiveness. We will focus on eight serious ADRs, and collect a high-quality reference standard for  those ADRs so that we will be able to evaluate and compare performance of the different detection methods  individually as well as the methods that combine the sources.   This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods, which  are primarily based on use of individual sources of data. We are confident the methods will be effective  because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in  this proposal presents an excellent chance to leverage heterogeneous data sources to dramatically improve  patient safety and reduce costs. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and health care, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring huge costs, and, therefore, continuous post-marketing surveillance  is crucial for patient safety. This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by  developing effective methods to discover new adverse drug reactions through the combination of information in  the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System, the literature, and comprehensive clinical data from electronic  health records of two different sites with diverse populations, thereby overcoming limitations that rely mainly on  use of one data source.",Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data,9109047,R01LM010016,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Probability', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data mining', 'ethnic difference', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'prevent', 'racial difference', 'research and development', 'text searching']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,430717,-0.0018174852665719511
"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research.

"Clinical Text Automatic De-Identification to Support Large Scale Data Reuse and Sharing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The adoption of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is growing at a fast pace in the U.S., and this growth results in very large quantities of patient clinical data becoming available in electronic format, with tremendous potentials, but also equally growing concern for patient confidentiality breaches. Secondary use of clinical data is essential to fulfill the potentials for high quality healthcare, improved healthcare management, and effective clinical research. NIH expects that larger research projects share their research data in a way that protects the confidentiality of the research subjects. De-identification of patient data has been proposed as a solution to both facilitate secondary uses of clinical data, and protect patient data confidentiality. The majority of clinical data found in the EHR is represented as narrative text clinical notes, and de-identification of clinical text is a tedious ad costly manual endeavor. Automated approaches based on Natural Language Processing have been implemented and evaluated, allowing for much faster de- identification than manual approaches. Clinacuity, Inc. proposes to develop a new system to automatically de-identify clinical notes found in the EHR, to then improve the availability of clinical text for secondary uses, as well as ameliorate the protection of patient data confidentiality. To establish the merit and feasibility of such a system, we will work on the following objectives: 1) create a reference standard for training and testing the text de-identification application, a reference standard that will include a random sample of clinical narratives with protected health information annotated by domain experts; 2) develop a prototype to automatically de-identify clinical text in near real-time, a prototype that will implement a novel stepwise hybrid approach to maximize sensitivity first (our priority for de-identification), and then filter out false positives to enhance positive predictive value, and also replace PHI with realistic substitutes for improved protection; and 3) test the prototype with the aforementioned reference standard, using a cross-validation approach for training and testing, and also train and test the prototype with a reference standard from another healthcare organization. Commercial application: To strengthen patient information confidentiality protection, the HITECH Act heightened financial penalties incurred for breaches of PHI, even introducing criminal penalties. These new severe consequences for violation of patient information confidentiality render protection requirements even more obvious, and automatic high-accuracy clinical text de-identification, as offered by the system Clinacuity proposes, will strongly help healthcare and clinical research organizations avoid such consequences. This system has potential commercial applications in clinical research and in healthcare settings. It will improve access to richer, more detailed, and more accurate clinical data (in clinical text) for clinical researchers. It will also ease research data sharing, and help healthcare organizations protect patient data confidentiality.

"Semi-supervised learning with electronic medical records Project Summary/Abstract The implementation of electronic medical record (EMR) systems in routine healthcare has resulted in a rich and inexpensive source of data for translational research. When linked with specimen biobanks, these extensive databases offer a unique opportunity to accelerate the goals of disease genomics as they contain large amounts of detailed clinical and genetic data collected for the purposes of medical care [4; 6; 7; 8; 9]. However, the statistical methods to analyze EMR data are limited and thus the focus of this proposal.  In particular, extracting accurate disease phenotype information is a major challenge impeding EMR-based research [10]. Currently, ICD9 codes are used to conﬁrm presence or absence of a disease in cohorts derived from EMRs. These codes are extremely variable and therefore have a signiﬁcant impact on the statistical power of genetic studies [11; 12]. An alternative approach is to develop a highly accurate algorithm to classify disease status. But due to the laborious medical record review required to obtain validated phenotype information for classiﬁer estimation, phenotypes are only available for a small training set nested in a large cohort. In contrast, predictors of phenotype are available for all observations. To improve accuracy and efﬁciency in model estimation and evaluation, it is therefore of interest to develop semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods that utilize the so- called unlabeled data or observations without conﬁrmed phenotype status in addition to the labeled training set.  Although a great body of literature on SSL exists, nearly all methods concern estimation of classiﬁers or prediction rules when the labeled training set is a simple random sample from the large unlabeled data set [13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19; 20; 21]. Despite the practical importance of evaluating the prediction performance of an estimated model, no SSL procedures currently exist to improve the estimation of model performance parame- ters. Additionally, the simple random sampling assumption is restrictive and the development of semi-supervised (SS) methods that accommodate more ﬂexible sampling schemes in the context of both model estimation and evaluation is needed.  In this proposal, these limitations are addressed through formulation of an efﬁcient method to estimate various prediction performance measures including the ROC curve within the traditional SS framework of simple random sampling. The stratiﬁed random sampling design in the SS setting is also considered and methods to estimate a classiﬁer and its accuracy are developed. These procedures will be applied to EMR-based studies of bipolar disorder and depression. The success of this work will thus improve efﬁciency in analyzing EMR data and expedite the use of EMRs in clinical and genetic research in neuropsychiatry. Project Narrative  The use of electronic medical records (EMRs) in routine healthcare has generated a rich source of data for in-depth study of disease risk factors. However, EMR data typically consists of a very small number of expensive observations with information on disease status and a large amount of automatically extracted data concerning risk factors such as laboratory results and previous health history. Statistical methods that accommodate this data structure are limited and thus the focus of this proposal.",Semi-supervised learning with electronic medical records,9192096,F31GM119263,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'International', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'ROC Curve', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scheme', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data structure', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'repository', 'success']",NIGMS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,F31,2016,34098,0.020902617044466817
"5/6 COMpAAAS U24: Resource in Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) The overall aim of the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/Aids, Alcohol, Aging, & multi- Substance use (COMpAAAS) is to build and disseminate the evidence needed to optimize care for HIV+ experiencing medical harm from alcohol and related substance use, through coordinated, integrated, and externally validated observational, operations research modeling, and intervention studies. Combining and integrating the complimentary expertise of informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, we propose a U24 Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) to support and inform the other COMpAAAS components. This resource will address the complex challenges required to maximize power and minimize bias in analyses addressing consortium-wide questions. Advanced informatics methods supported include natural language processing (NLP), ontologies, database and clinical decision support, and application of vital data management tools for secure data collection, storage, annotation, retrieval, and integration. Advanced epidemiological and statistical methods include time-updated exposure techniques, multiple imputation, propensity score techniques, measurement error correction, and competing risks regression. Routine, but essential, statistical methods include Cox proportional hazards, logistic and linear regression, goodness of fit diagnostics, and agreement/accuracy metrics (kappa, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). The RIB will further leverage the observational and interventional studies, simulation models, and well-coordinated network of cores and workgroups of COMpAAAS with advanced informatics and biostatistical techniques tailored to the particular challenges of large scale, longitudinal data from multiple sources including electronic health records (EHR), clinical interventions, patient self-report, and tissue repositories. Our specific aims are to provide 1) statistical and 2) informatics expertise for COMpAAAS to maximize scientific impact. To accomplish this, we will enhance the design, recruitment, and follow-up of intervention studies, support appropriate design and execution of data analyses and cross cohort collaborations, provide advanced statistical methods plus estimates of alcohol patterns for OR modeling and identify sexual/gender minority populations (CHAMP) from VACS survey data. In addition we will enhance the Consortium Web-Based Laboratory (WBL Portal) informatics infrastructure to support ongoing research design, data collection and management, development and testing of interventions such as clinical decision support and eHealth tools and enhance support for the analysis of textual data. The Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) will extend and enhance the research capacities and productivity among investigators at the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/AIDS, Alcohol, Aging, and multi-Substance use (COMpAAAS).

"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care.

"Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (L-EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. It learns how to do so by analyzing patterns of patient data access f many physicians in many past cases in the EMR, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant for making clinical decisions in a given patient.      The hypothesis underlying this research is that the L-EMR system will have sufficiently high precision and recall in highlighting relevant data, decrease the average time to assess an intensive care unit (ICU) patient case, and be judged by critical care medicine (CCM) physicians to be clinically useful.    The first aim of this project is develop a highly-usable L-EMR user interface. The L-EMR user interface will include zoomable time-series displays of lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. Usability studies of the L-EMR user interface will guide revisions and enhancements.      The second aim of the project is to train statistical models that can be applied to a patient case to predict relevant lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will enlist CCM physicians to review a set of retrospective ICU patient cases on a focused set of clinical conditions. Participants will review these cases as if they were active patients, identifying relevant lab- results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will train and evaluate statistical models to predict relevant data, and identify the best performing algorithm to include in the L-EMR system.      The third aim of the project is to evaluate the L-EMR system. We will recruit CCM physicians to evaluate an L-EMR system based on user interfaces from Aim 1 and statistical models trained using the best performing algorithm in Aim 2 to highlight relevant data items. We will measure the precision and recall of the data-highlighting functionality for assessing patient cases and making clinical decisions (e.g., lab and medication orders), the time required to assess cases with and without the highlighting, and physicians' assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the L-EMR system.    If the results of these experiments are positive, as anticipated, this project will introduce a computational method that has significant potential to improve future EMR systems and enhance patient care. Narrative The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. The system works by analyzing patterns of EMR usage of physicians, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant in a given patient.

"Encoding and Processing Patient Allergy Information in EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allergies affect one in five Americans and are the 5th leading chronic disease in the U.S. Each year, allergies account for more than 17 million outpatient office visits. Although documenting and exchanging allergy information in electronic health records (EHRs) is becoming increasingly important, we still face multiple challenges. These include: lack of well-adopted standard terminologies for representing allergies, frequent entry of allergy information as free-text, and no existing process for reconciling allergy information. In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) conduct analyses on standard terminologies and a large allergy repository to build a comprehensive knowledge base for representing allergy information; 2) design, develop and evaluate a natural language processing (NLP) module for extracting and encoding free-text allergy information and integrate it with an existing NLP system; 3) measure the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed NLP system for the new process of allergy reconciliation; and 4) distribute our methods and tool, so they are widely available to other researchers and healthcare institutions for non-commercial use.

"NLP to Improve Accuracy and Quality of Dictated Medical Documents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Errors in medical documents represent a critical issue that can adversely affect healthcare quality and safety. Physician use of speech recognition (SR) technology has risen in recent years due to its ease of use and efficiency at the point of care. However, high error rates, upwards of 10-23%, have been observed in SR-generated medical documents. Error correction and content editing can be time consuming for clinicians. A solution to this problem is to improve accuracy through automated error detection using natural language processing (NLP). In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) build a large corpus of clinical documents dictated via SR across different healthcare institutions and clinical settings; 2) conduct error analysis to estimate the prevalence and severity of SR errors; 3) develop innovative methods based on NLP for automated error detection and correction and create a comprehensive knowledge base that contains confusion sets, error frequencies and other error patterns; 4) evaluate the performance of the proposed methods and tool; and 5) distribute our methods and findings to make them available to other researchers.

"Scalable EEG interpretation using Deep Learning and Schema Descriptors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic medical records (EMRs) collected at every hospital in the country collectively contain a staggering wealth of biomedical knowledge. EMRs can include unstructured text, temporally constrained measurements (e.g., vital signs), multichannel signal data (e.g., EEGs), and image data (e.g., MRIs). This information could be transformative if properly harnessed. Information about patient medical problems, treatments, and clinical course is essential for conducting comparative effectiveness research. Uncovering clinical knowledge that enables comparative research is the primary goal of this proposal. We will focus on the automatic interpretation of clinical EEGs collected over 12 years at Temple University Hospital (over 25,000 sessions and 15,000 patients). Clinicians will be able to retrieve relevant EEG signals and EEG reports using standard queries (e.g. ""Young patients with focal cerebral dysfunction who were treated with Topamax""). In Aim 1 we will automatically annotate EEG events that contribute to a diagnosis. We will develop automated techniques to discover and time-align the underlying EEG events using semi-supervised learning. In Aim 2 we will process the text from the EEG reports using state-of-the-art clinical language processing techniques. Clinical concepts, their type, polarity and modality shall be discovered automatically, as well as spatial and temporal information. In addition, we shall extract the medical concepts describing the clinical picture of patients from the EEG reports. In Aim 3, we will develop a patient cohort retrieval system that will operate on the clinical knowledge extracted in Aims 1 and 2. In addition we shall organize this knowledge in a unified representation: the Qualified Medical Knowledge Graph (QMKG), which will be built using BigData solutions through MapReduce. The QMKG will be able to be searched by biomedical researchers as well as practicing clinicians. The QMKG will also provide a characterization of the way in which events in an EEG are narrated by physicians and the validation of these across a BigData resource. The EMKG represents an important contribution to basic science. In Aim 4 we will validate the usefulness of the patient cohort identification system by collecting feedback from clinicians and medical students who will participate in a rigorous evaluation protocol. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the queries shall be designed and experts will provide relevance judgments for the results. For each query, medical experts shall examine the top-ranked cohorts for common precision errors (false positives) and the bottom five ranked common recall errors (false negatives). User validation testing will be performed using live clinical data and the feedback wil enhance the quality of the cohort identification system. The existence of an annotated BigData archive of EEGs will greatly increase accessibility for non- experts in neuroscience, bioengineering and medical informatics who would like to study EEG data. The creation of this resource through the development of efficient automated data wrangling techniques will demonstrate that a much wider range of BigData bioengineering applications are now tractable. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The primary goal of this proposal is to enable comparative research by automatically uncovering clinical knowledge from a vast BigData archive of clinical EEG signals and EEG reports collected over the past 12 years at Temple University Hospital. In the proposed project, we will develop a proof-of-concept based on the discovery of patient cohorts and provide an annotated BigData archive as well as the software that enabled the annotations and the generation of the patient cohort retrieval system.

"NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department Summary Timely identification of relevant or “need to know” clinical information about a patient’s history in the acute care setting can be critical for patient safety and medical decision-making. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. Currently, it is estimated that over 50% of the EHR is free-text. EHR search tools today are often inefficient, simplistic, and unable to rank or evoke the relevance of information for a particular problem or complaint. This is compounded by the fact that EHRs are amassing clinical information at an exponential rate. While the benefits of having a wealth of information at a provider’s fingertips seem obvious, the time and energy cost of culling through enormous amounts of data creates new issues of decreased efficiency and information overload for providers seeking to identify the most pertinent and relevant information about their patients. In the emergency department, where patients can present with life threatening conditions, timely unlocking of clinically relevant information for a patient’s problem or complaint at the point of care can be critical to medical decision-making and patient safety. In this study, we plan to address this challenge through the development of a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information based on the patients presenting complaint. We will accomplish this through the following specific aims: 1) identify and define complaint- specific information elements within a patient’s history and 2) develop and test an NLP-based information retrieval tool. Narrative Patient safety hinges on having right information about the right patient and the right time. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information from EHRs that providers rely upon to make medical decisions for their patients. This study comes at an important time where data in the EHRs is increasing at an exponential rate, creating a new problem for clinicians, that of finding all the relevant information for patient’s particular problem. This is particularly true in the emergency department setting where providers have limited if any prior relationship and often have to make quick decisions for patients with life threatening conditions. This search tool will provide a snapshot of clinically relevant information that the providers can view alongside the structured information already in the EHR. We believe this approach has the potential to increase clinician efficiency, decrease healthcare costs by avoiding duplicate diagnostic tests, and provide clinicians with the tools they need to make well-informed medical decisions, thereby improving patient safety and reducing suffering.",NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department,9245525,R21HS024541,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R21,2016,148922,0.03427909080317217
"Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical error is one of the leading causes of death in the US. The study and reduction of medical errors have become a major concern in healthcare today. It is believed that medical error reporting systems could be a good resource to share and to learn from errors if medical error data are collected in a properly structured format and are useful for the detection of patterns, discovery of underlying factors, and generation of solutions. Effectively gathering information from previous lessons and timely informing the subsequent action are the two major goals for the design, development and utilization of such a system. The Common Formats (CFs) suggested by AHRQ tend to unify the future reporting format, which holds promise in improving data consistency and reducing unsafe conditions through lessons learned. However, effective gathering medical incident data does not merely rely on a unified structure. To be able to learn from previous lessons, it heavily depends upon the quality reports and learning features offered by systems. Medical incident data are always the key components and invaluable assets in patient safety research. The long term goal of the project is to understand the occurrence and causes of medical incidents in real practice and to develop interventions based on collection of incident reports to minimize the recurrence of similar incidents that have been reported. The objective of this application is to improve the utilization f voluntary reporting systems that each healthcare institution has been put in use by developing a learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, automatically link historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews in patient safety. As moving toward CFs, the researchers propose a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach that will help reporters generate complete and accurate reports through user-friendly guidance and offer timely comments and relevant peer reviews through educational tools during and after incident reporting. The researchers employ a case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the knowledge-based toolkit which helps reporters improve the communication about patient safety through clear working definitions and advance training that builds knowledge about the safety culture and then provides continuing education through the system. The project holds promise in revolutionizing the design of voluntary medical incident reporting systems from an incident data repository to an advanced resource promoting complete and accurate incident reporting and learning toward a just and learning culture. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Timely reporting and effective learning from medical incidents is considered an effective way in developing strategies for reducing medical errors. Utilizing an innovative a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach combining with case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques, we propose to develop a knowledgebase and learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, linking historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews on patient safety. We envision that the innovative approach will facilitate timely, quality reporting and learning from the incidents and ultimately cultivating a just and learning culture of patient safety.",Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit,9144757,R01HS022895,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2016,249135,0.03969777249632025
"Automated Problem and Allergy Lists Enrichment Based on High Accuracy Information Extraction from the Electronic Health Record ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical errors are recognized as the cause of numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many are preventable. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information in the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of the information available in the EHR is only mentioned in narrative clinical documents. Electronic lists of problems and allergies are available in most EHRs, but they require manual management by their users, to add new problems, modify existing ones, and the removal of the ones that are irrelevant. Consequently, these electronic lists are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. Clinacuity, Inc. proposed a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the EHR of patients suffering from cancer, and established its feasibility. To advance this new system from a prototype to an accurate, adaptable, and robust system, integrated into the commercial EHR system used in our implementation and testing site (Huntsman Cancer Institute and University of Utah Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah), and ready for commercialization efforts, we will work on the following aims: 1) enhance the NLP system performance, scalability, and quality, 2) develop an advanced visualization interface for local adaptation of the NLP system, and 3) integrate the NLP system with a commercial EHR system. A large and varied reference standard for training and testing the information extraction application will also be developed, a reference standard including a random sample of de-identified clinical narratives from patients treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute and at the University of Utah Hospital (Salt Lake City, Utah), with problems and allergies annotated by domain experts. Commercial application: The system Clinacuity proposes will not only help healthcare providers maintain complete and timely lists of problems and allergies, providing them with an efficient overview of a patient, but also help healthcare organizations attain meaningful use requirements. The proposed system has potential commercial applications in inpatient and outpatient settings, increasing the efficiency of busy healthcare providers by saving time, and aiding healthcare organizations in demonstrating ""meaningful use"" and obtaining Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services incentive payments. Clinacuity will further extend the commercial potential of the system and its output, using modular design principles allowing utilization of each module independently, and enhancing its local adaptability for easier deployment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical errors cause numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many could be prevented. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information such as entries in electronic lists of problems and allergies. Such lists are available in most electronic health records, but they require manual management and are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. On the other hand, clinical text reports contain the majority of the patient information, including problems and allergies.

"Informatics Tools for Pharmacogenomic Discovery using Practice-based Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for observational research. More recently, huge efforts have linked EMR databases with archived biological material, to accelerate research in personalized medicine. EMR- linked DNA biobanks have identified common and rare genetic variants that contribute to risk of disease. An appealing vision, which has not been extensively explored, is to use EMRs-linked biobanks for pharmacogenomic studies, which identify associations between genetic variation and drug efficacy and toxicity. The longitudinal nature of the data contained within EMRs make them ideal for quantifying drug outcome (both efficacy and toxicity). Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large-scale studies of treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. Despite its success, EMR-based pharmacogenomic studies are often hampered by its data-intensive nature -- it is time- consuming and costly to extract and integrate data from multiple heterogeneous EMR databases, for large-scale pharmacogenomic studies. The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) is a National Center for Biomedical Computing based at Partners Healthcare System. I2b2 has developed a scalable informatics framework to enable clinical researchers to repurpose existing EMR data for clinical and genomic discovery. In this study, we will collaborate with i2b2 to extend its informatics framework to the pharmacogenomics domain, by proposing the following specific aims: 1) Develop new methods to extract and model drug exposure and outcome information from EMR and integrate them with the i2b2 NLP components; 2) Build ontology tools to normalize and integrate pharmacogenomic data across different sites; 3) Conduct known and novel pharmacogenomic studies to evaluate and refine tools developed in Aim 1 and 2; and 4) Disseminate the developed informatics tools among pharmacogenomic researchers.

"Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing deployments of electronic health records (EHRs) systems have made massive clinical data available electronically. However, much of detailed clinical information of patients is embedded in narrative text and is not directly accessible for computerized clinical applications. Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information in narrative document, have received great attention in the medical domain. Current state-of-the-art NLP approaches often involve building probabilistic models. However, the wide adoption of statistical methods in clinical NLP faces two grand challenges: 1) the lack of large annotated clinical corpora; and 2) the lack of methodologies that can efficiently integrate linguistic and domain knowledge with statistical learning. High-performance statistical NLP methods rely on large scale and high quality annotations of clinical text, but it is time-consuming and costly to create large annotated clinica corpora as it often requires manual review by physicians. Moreover, the medical domain is knowledge intensive. To achieve optimal performance, probabilistic models need to leverage medical domain knowledge. Therefore, methods that can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost would be highly desirable for clinical text processing.    In this study, we propose to investigate interactive machine learning (IML) methods to address the above challenges in clinical NLP. An IML system builds a classification model in an iterative process, which can actively select informative samples for annotation based on models built on previously annotated samples, thus reducing the annotation cost for model development. More importantly, an IML system also involves human inputs to the learning process (e.g., an expert can specify important features for a classification task based on domain knowledge). Thus, IML is an ideal framework for efficiently integrating rule-based (via domain experts specifying features) and statistics-based (via different learning algorithms) approaches to clinical NLP. To achieve our goal, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we plan to investigate different aspects of IML for word sense disambiguation, including developing new active learning algorithms and conducting cognitive usability analysis for efficient feature annotation by users. To demonstrate the broad uses of IML, we further extend IML approaches to two other important clinical NLP classification tasks: named entity recognition and clinical phenoytping in Aim 2. Finally we propose to disseminate the IML methods and tools to the biomedical research community in Aim 3. Project Narrative In this project, we propose to develop interactive machine learning methods to process clinical text stored in electronic health records (EHRs) systems. Such methods can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost, thus improving performance of text processors. This technology will allow more accurate data extraction from clinical documents, thus to facilitate clinical research that rely on EHRs data.",Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing,8936515,R01LM010681,"['Abbreviations', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'computerized', 'cost', 'experience', 'improved', 'model building', 'model development', 'novel', 'open source', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2015,448348,0.023285481475899077

"Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) contain useful information that is difficult to automatically extract, index, search, or interpret. Clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies for automatic extraction, indexing, searching, and interpretation of EHRs are in development; however, due to privacy concerns related to EHRs, such technologies are usually developed by teams that have privileged access to EHRs in a specific institution. Technologies that are tailored to a specific set of data from a given institution generate inspiring results on that data; however, they can fail to generalize to similar data from other institutions and even other departments from the same institution. Therefore, learning from these technologies and building on them becomes difficult.          In order to improve NLP in EHRs, there is need for head-to-head comparison of approaches that can address a given task on the same data set. Shared-tasks provide one way of conducting systematic head-to- head comparisons. This proposal describes a series of shared-task challenges and conferences, spread over a five year period, that promote the development and evaluation of cutting edge clinical NLP systems by distributing de-identified EHRs to the broad research community, under data use agreements, so that:      *	the state-of-the-art in clinical NLP technologies can be identified and advanced,      *	a set of technologies that enable the use of the information contained in EHR narratives becomes available, and      *	the information from EHR narratives can be made more accessible, for example, for clinical and medical research.          The scientific activities supporting the organization of the shared-task challenges are sponsored in part by Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), grant number U54-LM008748, PI: Kohane.          This proposal aims to organize a series of workshops, conference proceedings, and journal special issues that will accompany the shared-task challenges in order to disseminate the knowledge generated by the challenges. Public health relevance: this proposal will address two main challenges related to the use of clinical narratives for research: availability of clinical records for research and identification of the state of the art in clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies so that we can push the state of the art forward and so that future work can build on the past.

"Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have shown promise for extracting data from the free text of electronic health records (EHRs), but studies have consistently found that techniques do not readily generalize across application settings. Unfortunately, most of the focus in applying NLP to real use cases has remained on a paradigm of single, well-defined application settings, so that generalizability to unseen use cases remains implicitly unaddressed. We propose to explicitly account for unseen application settings by adopting an information retrieval (IR) perspective with the objective of patient-level cohort identification. To do so, we introduce layered language models, an IR framework that enables the reuse of NLP-produced artifacts. Our long term goal is to accelerate investigations of patient health and disease by providing robust, user- centric tools that are necessary to process, retrieve, and utilize the free text of EHRs. The main goal of this proposal is to accurately retrieve ad hoc, realistic cohorts from clinical text at Mayo Clinic and OHSU, establishing methods, resources, and evaluation for patient-level IR. We hypothesize that cohort identification can be addressed in a generalizable fashion by a new IR framework: layered language models. We will test this hypothesis through four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will make medical NLP artifacts searchable in our layered language IR framework. This involves storing and indexing the NLP artifacts, as well as using statistical language models to retrieve documents based on text and its associated NLP artifacts. In Aim 2, we deal with the practical setting of ad hoc cohort identification, moving to patient-level (rather than document-level) IR. To accurately handle patient cohorts in which qualifying evidence may be spread over multiple documents, we will develop and implement patient-level retrieval models that account for cross- document relational and temporal combinations of events. In Aim 3, we will construct parallel IR test collections using EHR data from two sites; a diverse set of cohort queries written by multiple people toward various clinical or epidemiological ends; and assessments of which patients are relevant to which queries at both sites. Finally, in Aim 4, we refine and evaluate patient-level layered language IR on the ad hoc cohort identification task, making comparisons across the users, queries, optimization metrics, and institutions. We will draw additional extrinsic comparisons with pre-existing techniques, e.g., for cohorts from the Electronic Medical Records and Genonmics network. The expected outcomes of the proposed work are: (i) An open-source cohort identification tool, usable by clinicians and epidemiologists, that makes principled use of NLP artifacts for unseen queries; ii) A parallel test collection for cohort identification, includig two intra-institutional document collections, diverse test topics and user-produced text queries, and patient-level judgments of relevance to each query; and (iii) Validation of the reusability of medical NLP via the task of retrieving patient cohorts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  With the widespread adoption of electronic medical records, one might expect that it would be simple for a medical expert to find things like ""patients in the community who suffer from asthma."" Unfortunately, on top of lab tests, medications, and demographic information, there are observations that a physician writes down as text - which are difficult for a computer to understand. Therefore, we aim to process text so that a computer can understand enough of it, and then search that text along with the rest of a patient's medical record; this will allow clinicians or researchers to find and study patients groups of interest.",Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification,8928647,R01LM011934,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Asthma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Institution', 'Interest Group', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Smoke', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Writing', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'cohort', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'open source', 'query optimization', 'syntax', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2015,376327,0.0529927541018058
"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified.

"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data.

"Natural language processing for clinical and translational research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for clinical and translational research. This growth is being fueled by recent federal legislation that provides generous financial incentives to institutions demonstrating aggressive application and ""meaningful use"" of comprehensive EMRs. Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large scale studies of disease onset and treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. However, a well-known challenge for secondary use of EMR data for clinical and translational research is that much of detailed patient information is embedded in narrative text. Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, which are able to convert unstructured clinical text into coded data, have been introduced into the biomedical domain and have demonstrated promising results. Researchers have used NLP systems to identify clinical syndromes and common biomedical concepts from radiology reports, discharge summaries, problem lists, nursing documentation, and medical education documents. Different NLP systems have been developed at different institutions and utilized to convert clinical narrative text into structured data that may be used for other clinical applications and studies. Successful stories in applying NLP to clinical and translational research have been reported widely. However, institutions often deploy different NLP systems, which produce various types of output formats and make it difficult to exchange information between sites. Therefore, the lack of interoperability among different clinical NLP systems becomes a bottleneck for efficient multi-site studies. In addition, many successful studies often require a strong interdisciplinary team where informaticians and clinicians have to work very closely to iteratively define optimal algorithms for clinical phenotypes. As intensive informatics support may not be available to every clinical researcher, the usability of NLP systems for end users is another important issue. The proposed project builds upon first-hand knowledge and experience across the research team in the use of NLP for clinical and translational research projects. There are several big informatics initiatives for clinical and translational research but those initiatives generally assume one shoe fits all and follow top-down approaches to develop NLP solutions. Complementary to those initiatives, we will use a bottom-up approach to handle interoperability and usability: i) we will obtain a common NLP data model and exchange format through empirical analysis of existing NLP systems and NLP results; ii) we will develop a user-centric NLP front end interface for NLP systems wrapped to be consistent with the proposed NLP data model and exchange format incorporating usability analysis into the agile development process. All deliverables will be distributed through the open health NLP (OHNLP) consortium which we intend to make it more open and inclusive. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for clinical and translational research.

"Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Timely detection of severe patient conditions or concerning events and their mitigation remains an important problem in clinical practice. This is especially true in the critically ill patient. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming, costly, and difficult to extract and implement such knowledge in existing monitoring systems. The research work in this proposal offers computational, rather than expert-based, solutions that build alert systems from data stored in patient data repositories, such as electronic medical records. Briefly, our approach uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify unusual clinical management patterns in individual patients, relative to patterns associated with comparable patients, and raises an alert signaling this discrepancy. Our previous studies provide support that such deviations indicate clinically important events at false alert rates belo 50%, which is very promising. We propose to further improve the new methodology, and build a real-time monitoring and alerting system integrated with production electronic medical records. We propose an evaluation of the system using physicians' assessment of alerts raised by our real-time system for intensive-care unit (ICU) patient cases. The project investigators comprise a multidisciplinary team with expertise in critical care medicine, computer science, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, knowledge based systems, and clinical data repositories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors in the intensive care unit (ICU). This project develops and evaluates a new clinical monitoring and alerting framework that uses electronic medical records and machine-learning methods to send alerts concerning clinical decisions in the ICU that are unexpected given the clinical context and may represent medical errors.",Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams,8912480,R01GM088224,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electronics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Practice Management', 'Production', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Stream', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'design', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'liver transplantation', 'multidisciplinary', 'prototype']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,583203,0.02317893775877909
"Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that optimal treatment is not the same for every patient - it depends on the individual patient's circumstances. One important factor that determines the optimal clinical management is the patient's life expectancy, which determines the temporal horizon within which medical decisions have to operate. For example, while adding an extra diabetes medication may save a 40-year-old individual from going blind or developing kidney failure 20 years later, it will not bring any benefits to an 80-yer old with a metastatic malignancy who is expected to live only a few months.  Consequently, it is critical that when we measure quality of care, suggest treatment options to clinicians through clinical decision support or compare different treatment strategies, we take into account the patient's life expectancy. However, currently there are no methods available that can do this with sufficient accuracy.  Most commonly used techniques to assess a patient's mortality risk draw primarily on administrative data and other structured data fields in electronic medical records. This approach leaves out a large amount of information that is only available in narrative documents such as provider notes, radiology reports, etc. In this project we propose to test the hypothesis that application of two novel technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing (NLP) - could leverage the information in narrative electronic documents to significantly improve the accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.  Dynamic Logic allows to circumvent the challenge of combinatorial complexity that limits the number of variables and their combinations that can be considered as predictors of an outcome by most currently used analytical methods. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly increase the richness of the models for identification of patients with low life expectancy and ultimately improve their accuracy.  Information such as the patient's functional status that is usually only found in narrative documents may be critical to improving accuracy of identifying frail patients at high mortality risk. Modern NLP techniques can effectively identify key concepts in medical text but until now analytical methods allowed consideration of only a few of pre-selected concepts in prediction models. Combining NLP with Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly expand the number of concepts from narrative text that could be included in the life expectancy prediction model, likely leading to a considerable improvement in accuracy.  In the proposed translational multidisciplinary project our team that will include experts on artificial intelligence, natural language processing, analysis of data in electronic medical records, and geriatrics will test whether a combination of Dynamic Logic and NLP improves identification of patients at high risk of death.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identification of patients with limited life expectancy is important for accurate measurement of quality of care delivered by clinicians, clinical decision support in electronic medical records and research that compares different treatment options for patients. However, currently available methods suffer from low accuracy or use information that is not widely available. In this project we propose to combine two advanced computational technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing - to improve accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.            ",Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy,8942806,R01HS024090,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2015,232521,0.03754272021020816
"Utilizing social media as a resource for mental health surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major depressive disorder is one of the most common debilitating illnesses in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Currently, nationwide mental health surveillance takes the form of large-scale telephone- based surveys. These surveys have high running costs and require teams of human telephone operators. Even the largest system, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, reaches only 0.13% of the US population. Twitter (and other microblog services) offers a rich, if terse, multilingual source of real time data for public health surveillance. Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides techniques and resources to ""unlock"" data from text. We propose using Twitter and NLP as a cost-effective and flexible approach to augmenting current telephone- based surveillance methods for population level depression monitoring.         This grant application has two major strands. First, investigating ethical issues and challenges to privacy that emerge with the use of Twitter data for public health surveillance (Aim One). Second, developing techniques and resources for real-time public health surveillance for mental illness from Twitter (Aim Two &Aim Three). Aim One seeks to investigate and codify our responsibilities as researchers towards Twitter users by engaging with those users directly. With Aim Two, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing resources - algorithms, lexicons and taxonomies - to support the identification of depression symptoms in Twitter data. For Aim Three, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing modules and services that use Twitter as a data source for monitoring depression levels in the community. The significance of the proposed work lies in three areas. First, our investigations - both empirical and theoretical - will explore ethical issues in the use of Twitter for public health surveillance. This work has the potential to guide future research in the area. Second, in developing and evaluating algorithms and resources for identifying depression from tweets, we are contributing foundational work to the field of NLP. Third, developing these algorithms and resources will provide the bedrock for building social media based surveillance systems which will provide a cost effective means of augmenting current mental health surveillance practice. This proposal is innovative in both its application area (microblogs have not been used before for mental health surveillance), its focus on using NLP to identify depressive symptoms for public health, and in the central role that qualitative bioethical research will play in guiding the work. Project Narrative The proposed research focuses on using advanced Natural Language Processing methods to mine microblog data - in this case, Twitter - for mental health surveillance (specifically, depression surveillance), in order to augment current telephone-based mental health surveillance systems.

"BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: DA: Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictions of Outcomes (C3PO)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An unsolved problem in health informatics is how to apply the past experiences of patients, stored in large-scale medical records systems, to predict the outcomes of patients and to individualize care. One approach to prediction, heretofore impractical, is rapidly finding a patient cohort ""similar enough"" to an index case that the health experiences and outcomes of this cohort are informative for prediction. This task is formidable because of large variability of the vast numbers of patient attributes with the added complexity of sequences of patient encounters evolving over time. Epidemiological considerations such as confounding by indication for treatment also come into play. The objective of this research effort is to (1) create a modular test bed that uses a ""big data"" systems architecture to support research in rapid individualized prediction of outcomes from large clinical repositories and (2) to explore various approaches to making ""pragmatic"" near-term predictions of outcomes. Using the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Informatics and Computing Infrastructure database (VINCI), a research database with records of tens of millions of patients, we will explore two synergistic strategies for rapidly finding a cohort of patients that are similar enough to an index patient to predict near-term treatment response and/or adverse effects in an elastic cloud environment: 1) use of temporal alignment of critical events including use of gene sequence alignment methods to relax requirements for exact temporal matching; and, 2) use of conceptual distance metrics to model the degree of content similarity of case records. The initial domain of application will be treatment of Type 2 diabetes. The approach will apply open source ""big data"" methodologies, including Hadoop and Accumulo, to store and filter ""medical log"" files. The content of these ""logs"" will be processed by a combination with strategies including conceptual markup of events using natural language processing tools, matching of event streams, and statistical data mining methods to rapidly retrieve and identify patients that are sufficiently similar to an index case to be able to make personalized yet pragmatic clinical predictions of outcomes. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This proposal studies how to use experience of past patients, stored in electronic medical records systems, to help clinicians make practical decisions on the care of complex patients with type 1 diabetes. Research applies methods adapted from Internet search engines and from studies of the human genome to determine what it means for one patient's disease experiences to be similar to and relevant to another's.              n/a",BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: DA: Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictions of Outcomes (C3PO),8840825,R01GM108346,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human Development', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncogenes', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Triage', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Visualization software', 'Vocabulary', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer type', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interoperability', 'medical information system', 'novel', 'open source', 'parallel processing', 'performance tests', 'processing speed', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sugar', 'system architecture', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'virtual']",NIGMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2015,529458,0.00934676810288629
"Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health information technology (HIT) can lower costs, strengthen productivity, and promote safety. To realize such benefits on a large scale, healthcare organizations (HCOs) are adopting electronic health records (EHRs) to provide various capabilities. Yet, as EHRs and the healthcare workforce grow in diversity, so does their complexity. This is a concern because evidence suggests complex HIT can interrupt care delivery, contribute to medical errors, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. Moreover, such events tend to be discovered only after they transpire en masse, leading to negative media coverage, loss of patients' trust, and sanctions. Federal regulations now enable patients to receive accountings of who accessed their medical records during treatment, payment, and operations related activities. Yet, for patients to make sense of such accountings, they need to be provided with explanations regarding the extent to which accesses are normal in the context of routine HCO activities. We believe that relating specific accesses to patterns of healthcare operations can help explain how medical records are utilized. Unfortunately, many of the aforementioned problems manifest because EHR utilization patterns rarely guide the design and refinement of healthcare management practices. Thus, the overarching objective of our research is to develop novel strategies to automatically learn HCO behavior based on EHR usage. The past several years has witnessed a flurry of activity in this field, but it remains in is infancy and has only scratched the surface of care patterns and the types of anomalies that can be detected. Through this project, we propose to develop anomaly detection methods that integrate the semantics of healthcare operations and allow for the detection of workflows over time. This will enable HCOs and patients to audit in a meaningful way. Moreover, we believe the innovation and dissemination of such data mining strategies will enable HCOs to detect anomalous events that indicate system misuse and patients who require special attention, but also effectively audit business practices and discover inefficient workflows. The specific aims of this project are (1) to develop machine learning approaches, based on intrasession utilization patterns, to streamline EHR interface configuration and detect anomalous sessions, (2) to design a data mining framework, based on intersession EHR access patterns, to characterize HCO departmental interactions in patient treatment and detect anomalous events, and (3) to infer patient management pathways to consolidate redundant processes and detect deviations from anticipated workflows. In support of these goals, we will evaluate, compare, and contrast the workflows and anomalies in the EHR systems of two large medical centers. Additionally, we will ensure that our methods are integrated into an open source software system that can assist HCOs to extract, transform, and load (ETL) access data from EHRs, analyze such data for anomalies, and visualize the results in interfaces that enable review by healthcare administrators and patients. In doing so, we will be able to compare and contrast behavior of the workflows and multiple institutions and develop methods that appropriately generalize across EHR systems. As electronic health record systems, and healthcare organizations, grow in diversity, so do their complexity, which can lead to inefficient documentation, management of patients, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. In this research, we will develop technologies, to be disseminated through an open source software suite, to learn patterns associated with healthcare operations, upon which anomaly detection techniques can be based. The specific goals of this project are to 1) model HCO users' intrasession behaviors when interacting with an EHR, 2) learn interdepartmental relations based on the accesses of common patients, and 3) infer patient management pathways based on the sequence of accesses to a patient's record.",Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records,8882547,R01LM010207,"['Accounting', 'Administrator', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Interdepartmental Relations', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Neonatal Intensive Care', 'Neonatology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Patterns of Care', 'Phase', 'Practice Management', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'comparative', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health information technology', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'payment', 'programs', 'software systems', 'ward']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,80,0.023998319068527427
"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted.

"InfoMediator: Weaving Clinical Expertise in Online Health Communities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic illness can be overwhelming to patients because it impacts many areas of their daily lives. Accordingly, many patients turn to online health support groups to get social support. In face-to-face patient support groups (F2F), health professional moderators provide clinical expertise within the context of peer-patients' sharing of experience. However, in online health community settings, because health professionals' time and resources are expensive, it is challenging to get health professionals' opinions for thousands of messages posted each day. To solve this problem, I propose to develop methods and techniques that maximize the use of already available clinical expertise online for online peer-patient conversation threads by developing a system, InfoMediator. The InfoMediator will semi-automatically weave health professionals' existing answers to patients' questions into peer-patient conversations by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques complemented by user feedback. As the career development component of this proposal, I deepen my skills and knowledge in NLP necessary for proposed work and patient education. As I develop the NLP techniques and knowledge in patient education, I and my mentors will develop methods and techniques that address weaving clinical expertise within peer-patient conversations by designing, implementing, and evaluating socio-technical aspects of the InfoMediator. The training opportunities provided by this NIH NLM K01 grant, together with the supportive research environment at Michigan State University, will help further extend my existing expertise in human-computer interaction, design, and health informatics to establish my independent informatics research program in patient-centered technologies. Focusing on persons with diabetes, the outcomes of the proposed research will help us understand how to empower persons with diabetes to improve self- efficacy and self-care, while increasing the quality of online health information environment. 8.

"Developing Evidence- based User Centered Design and Implementation Guidelines to Improve Health Information Technology Usability ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to provide an evidence-base to better inform user centered design and implementation processes to improve health information technology (health IT) usability and safety. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-15-005). Utilizing a hybrid approach of expert manual review and machine learning techniques, specifically natural language processing, we will develop methods to rapidly analyze patient safety event data to determine which events are health IT related. We will then further categorize the health IT related safety events to determine which events could have been prevented by effective usability or implementation processes. Through this analysis we will be able to specify the usability and implementation processes that are critical to the safe and effective use of health IT. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health IT, and computer science. The proposed research is based on unique insights that our team gleaned from previous research that we conducted focusing on health IT vendor design and implementation processes. The application addresses fundamental aspects of the call for applications by providing an evidence base to improve health IT usability and safety to better inform policy and practice.

"Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports  Abstract Communication of clinically important follow-up recommendations when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. The absence of an automated system to identify and track radiology follow-up recommendations is an important barrier to ensuring timely follow-up of patients, especially for non-acute but potentially life threatening and unexpected findings. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to extract clinically important recommendation information from free-text radiology reports. Each radiology report will be preprocessed at the structural, syntactic, and semantic level to generate features that will be used to extract the boundaries of sentences that include recommendation information as well as the details of reason for recommendation, requested imaging test, and recommendation time frame. We will use a large corpus of free-text radiology reports represented by a mixture of modalities (e.g., radiography, computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) from three different institutions. Using this dataset we will perform the following specific aims: Aim 1. Create a multi- institutional radiology report corpus annotated for clinically important recommendation information; Aim 2. Develop a novel NLP system to extract clinically important recommendations in radiology reports. The proposed research is innovative because it will generate a new text processing approach that can be used to flag reports visually and electronically so that separate workflow processes can be initiated to reduce the chance that necessary investigations or interventions suggested in the report are missed by clinicians. The proposed set of tools will be disseminated to the biomedical informatics community as open source tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Communication of recommendations for necessary investigations and interventions when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. When recommendations are not systematically identified and promptly communicated to referrers, poor patient outcomes can result. We propose to build natural language processing tools to automatically extract clinically important recommendation information from radiology reports.                ",Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports,8804856,R21EB016872,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidental Findings', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Lung nodule', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Washington', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer care', 'care delivery', 'design', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2015,217500,0.017123443958806127
"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",8911361,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'tool', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2015,325159,0.03690607077009792
"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.                ",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,8798027,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2015,299888,0.05991207060317247
"Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and healthcare, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring a huge cost. The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance  patient safety and reduce costs by discovering novel serious ADRs through use of automated methods that  combine information from large and varied patient populations as well as from the literature. There have been  considerable advances in pharmacovigilance, but more work is needed. For example, Vioxx, a commonly used  drug, was recently found to cause at least 88,000 occurrences of myocardial infarction, highlighting the  insufficiency of current methods. To date, methods have mainly depended on the use of single sources of data,  primarily from the Federal Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and from  electronic health records (EHRS). Although important, each of the sources has different limitations and  advantages, and therefore, combining the data across them should lead to more effective drug safety  surveillance by increasing the statistical power, and also by allowing each data source to complement the other  sources. We already have developed methods associated with each of the single sources, and therefore, this  is an excellent opportunity to build upon our research accomplishments to advance the state of the art in  pharmacovigilance.   More specifically, we will a) acquire and combine comprehensive clinical data from the electronic health  records (EHRs) of two different health care sites serving diverse populations by utilizing natural language  processing (NLP) to obtain vast quantities of fine-grained data, and then by developing data mining  methodologies on the clinical data to detect novel ADR signals, b) analyze differences in therapy-related risk  factors between the two EHR populations, such as racial and ethnic differences, c) detect ADR signals in the  FAERS database using an established methodology, d) develop improved methods to acquire ADR signals  based on information in the literature, and e) develop methods that utilize the results from the above sources to  maximize effectiveness. We will focus on eight serious ADRs, and collect a high-quality reference standard for  those ADRs so that we will be able to evaluate and compare performance of the different detection methods  individually as well as the methods that combine the sources.   This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods, which  are primarily based on use of individual sources of data. We are confident the methods will be effective  because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in  this proposal presents an excellent chance to leverage heterogeneous data sources to dramatically improve  patient safety and reduce costs. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and health care, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring huge costs, and, therefore, continuous post-marketing surveillance  is crucial for patient safety. This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by  developing effective methods to discover new adverse drug reactions through the combination of information in  the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System, the literature, and comprehensive clinical data from electronic  health records of two different sites with diverse populations, thereby overcoming limitations that rely mainly on  use of one data source.",Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data,8882546,R01LM010016,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Probability', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data mining', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'prevent', 'racial/ethnic difference', 'research and development', 'text searching']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,417794,-0.0018174852665719511
"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care.

"Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (L-EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. It learns how to do so by analyzing patterns of patient data access f many physicians in many past cases in the EMR, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant for making clinical decisions in a given patient.      The hypothesis underlying this research is that the L-EMR system will have sufficiently high precision and recall in highlighting relevant data, decrease the average time to assess an intensive care unit (ICU) patient case, and be judged by critical care medicine (CCM) physicians to be clinically useful.    The first aim of this project is develop a highly-usable L-EMR user interface. The L-EMR user interface will include zoomable time-series displays of lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. Usability studies of the L-EMR user interface will guide revisions and enhancements.      The second aim of the project is to train statistical models that can be applied to a patient case to predict relevant lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will enlist CCM physicians to review a set of retrospective ICU patient cases on a focused set of clinical conditions. Participants will review these cases as if they were active patients, identifying relevant lab- results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will train and evaluate statistical models to predict relevant data, and identify the best performing algorithm to include in the L-EMR system.      The third aim of the project is to evaluate the L-EMR system. We will recruit CCM physicians to evaluate an L-EMR system based on user interfaces from Aim 1 and statistical models trained using the best performing algorithm in Aim 2 to highlight relevant data items. We will measure the precision and recall of the data-highlighting functionality for assessing patient cases and making clinical decisions (e.g., lab and medication orders), the time required to assess cases with and without the highlighting, and physicians' assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the L-EMR system.    If the results of these experiments are positive, as anticipated, this project will introduce a computational method that has significant potential to improve future EMR systems and enhance patient care.             Narrative The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. The system works by analyzing patterns of EMR usage of physicians, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant in a given patient.

"Encoding and Processing Patient Allergy Information in EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allergies affect one in five Americans and are the 5th leading chronic disease in the U.S. Each year, allergies account for more than 17 million outpatient office visits. Although documenting and exchanging allergy information in electronic health records (EHRs) is becoming increasingly important, we still face multiple challenges. These include: lack of well-adopted standard terminologies for representing allergies, frequent entry of allergy information as free-text, and no existing process for reconciling allergy information. In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) conduct analyses on standard terminologies and a large allergy repository to build a comprehensive knowledge base for representing allergy information; 2) design, develop and evaluate a natural language processing (NLP) module for extracting and encoding free-text allergy information and integrate it with an existing NLP system; 3) measure the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed NLP system for the new process of allergy reconciliation; and 4) distribute our methods and tool, so they are widely available to other researchers and healthcare institutions for non-commercial use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Managing allergy information within the electronic health record (EHR) is vital to ensuring patient safety. The goal of this study is to propose a comprehensive solution to assess existing terminology standards and knowledge bases for representing allergy information, develop and evaluate a natural language processing (NLP) system for extracting and encoding allergy information from free-text clinical documents, and finally measure the feasibility of using NLP output to facilitate the allergy reconciliation proces.",Encoding and Processing Patient Allergy Information in EHRs,8920540,R01HS022728,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2015,488893,0.062191316109163154
"NLP to Improve Accuracy and Quality of Dictated Medical Documents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Errors in medical documents represent a critical issue that can adversely affect healthcare quality and safety. Physician use of speech recognition (SR) technology has risen in recent years due to its ease of use and efficiency at the point of care. However, high error rates, upwards of 10-23%, have been observed in SR-generated medical documents. Error correction and content editing can be time consuming for clinicians. A solution to this problem is to improve accuracy through automated error detection using natural language processing (NLP). In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) build a large corpus of clinical documents dictated via SR across different healthcare institutions and clinical settings; 2) conduct error analysis to estimate the prevalence and severity of SR errors; 3) develop innovative methods based on NLP for automated error detection and correction and create a comprehensive knowledge base that contains confusion sets, error frequencies and other error patterns; 4) evaluate the performance of the proposed methods and tool; and 5) distribute our methods and findings to make them available to other researchers.

"Improving Accuracy of Electronic Notes Using A Faster, Simpler Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physician progress notes contain information essential to patient care, including findings from history and physical exam, interpretation of tests, assessment and treatment plans. However in the transition from paper to electronic physician notes, many physicians spend more time creating them, which has led to the use of time-saving measures such as copy/paste and templates that have degraded note accuracy and quality. This threatens the usefulness of notes not only for their most important use-patient care-but also for research, quality improvement, and in supporting reimbursement. To address these problems, we propose a project with the following specific aims: 1. To refine and implement a new voice-generated enhanced electronic note system (VGEENS) integrating voice recognition with natural language processing and links to the electronic medical record (EMR) to improve note accuracy and timeliness. 2. To evaluate VGEENS using a randomized trial with 30 internal medicine physicians in each arm to assess electronic note accuracy, quality, timeliness, and user satisfaction. Intervention physicians will use VGEENS, while the control physicians will continue with note creation as they normally would. This novel approach has the potential to improve note accuracy while reducing delays in making progress notes in EMRs available to other clinicians. It leverages rapidly improving voice recognition and NLP technologies to permit physicians to use a natural, fast method-human voice-to convey their observation and thoughts into the EMR record. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physician documentation of a patient visit contains information that is used in that patient's care. This information includes findings from a patient' history and physical exam, interpretation of necessary tests, the problem assessment and treatment plan. However, in the transition from paper to electronic physician notes, many physicians are spending more time creating these notes. This has led to use of time-saving measures that have degraded the accuracy and ease of use of patient notes. By the end of this project, we expect to have developed, used and evaluated a new method for creating electronic physician notes that both improve accuracy and timely availability of inpatient progress notes.","Improving Accuracy of Electronic Notes Using A Faster, Simpler Approach",8928601,R21HS023631,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2015,139245,0.027782728030509976
"Outpatient Adverse Drug Effect Alerting System Using Admission H&P Notes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will create, test, implement, and evaluate a real-time Adverse Drug Effect (ADE) alerting system at Vanderbilt University Hospital (VUH). Utilizing information extracted from admission history and physical examination notes (H&Ps) stored in the electronic medical record (EMR), our system will detect adult inpatients' previously unrecognized symptomatic ADEs and alert appropriate care providers. The project will create an ADE knowledge base, mined from multiple publically available sources including MEDLINE, RxNorm, and the product labels for human prescription drugs. Next, we will apply natural language processing (NLP) to EMR-based H&P texts to identify mentions of patients' current medications and dosages. We will similarly detect EMR-based H&P documentation of patients' clinical manifestations (CMs - diseases, symptoms, findings, etc.), and then represent them using the Unified Medical Language System's (UMLS) Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs). The system will then compare each patient's recognized medications and CMs against the aforementioned ADE knowledgebase, generating appropriate patient-specific alerts for potential adverse effects related to the patient's current medications. Each alert will identify the offendin medication, the suspected nature of the ADE, and evidence supporting the assertion. We will independently evaluate the accuracy of the ADE knowledgebase using expert manual review and comparison to multiple other sources. Before implementing the real-time ADE monitoring system, we will conduct a pilot implementation using retrospective EMR data from the Vanderbilt Synthetic Derivative (SD), a de-identified version of the Vanderbilt EMR. After successful testing and any necessary iterative improvements, we will implement the real-time detection system at VUH, initially monitoring newly admitted inpatients presenting to the Internal Medicine service. Using the methods described above, the system will detect potential ADEs each time a new inpatient H&P is generated, and alert appropriate clinicians via additions to an existing dashboard that the clinicians already utilize. We will survey clinicians immediately upon receipt of an ADE alert to determine if the alerting condition was already known or not, whether the alert seems plausible, and whether it requires intervention. Then we will compare discharge medications to admission medications to determine what actions occurred post-alert, independent of physician survey results. We will thus evaluate both the effectiveness of the system in improving ADE recognition and its perceived usefulness according to the physician-subjects. We hypothesize that our system will improve clinicians' awareness of ADEs in a manner applicable to any facility that stores admission H&Ps electronically. Addressing previously unrecognized ADEs has the potential to reduce costs and improve patient care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unrecognized adverse drug effects (ADEs), a serious clinical problem, cause preventable hospitalizations, increase healthcare costs, and worsen health outcomes. To potentially improve quality of care, my dissertation project will develop and evaluate a novel system to detect adult inpatients' previously unrecognized symptomatic ADEs and alert appropriate care providers. Using automated natural language processing of clinician-generated electronic admission history and physical exam (H&P) notes and a locally-developed ADE knowledgebase derived from publically available sources, the system, once validated, could improve both recognition and treatment of ADEs in a generalizable manner - applicable in hospital environments using electronic medical records.            ",Outpatient Adverse Drug Effect Alerting System Using Admission H&P Notes,8796404,R36HS023485,[' '],AHRQ,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R36,2015,41626,0.030613349073360364
"Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical error is one of the leading causes of death in the US. The study and reduction of medical errors have become a major concern in healthcare today. It is believed that medical error reporting systems could be a good resource to share and to learn from errors if medical error data are collected in a properly structured format and are useful for the detection of patterns, discovery of underlying factors, and generation of solutions. Effectively gathering information from previous lessons and timely informing the subsequent action are the two major goals for the design, development and utilization of such a system. The Common Formats (CFs) suggested by AHRQ tend to unify the future reporting format, which holds promise in improving data consistency and reducing unsafe conditions through lessons learned. However, effective gathering medical incident data does not merely rely on a unified structure. To be able to learn from previous lessons, it heavily depends upon the quality reports and learning features offered by systems. Medical incident data are always the key components and invaluable assets in patient safety research. The long term goal of the project is to understand the occurrence and causes of medical incidents in real practice and to develop interventions based on collection of incident reports to minimize the recurrence of similar incidents that have been reported. The objective of this application is to improve the utilization f voluntary reporting systems that each healthcare institution has been put in use by developing a learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, automatically link historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews in patient safety. As moving toward CFs, the researchers propose a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach that will help reporters generate complete and accurate reports through user-friendly guidance and offer timely comments and relevant peer reviews through educational tools during and after incident reporting. The researchers employ a case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the knowledge-based toolkit which helps reporters improve the communication about patient safety through clear working definitions and advance training that builds knowledge about the safety culture and then provides continuing education through the system. The project holds promise in revolutionizing the design of voluntary medical incident reporting systems from an incident data repository to an advanced resource promoting complete and accurate incident reporting and learning toward a just and learning culture. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Timely reporting and effective learning from medical incidents is considered an effective way in developing strategies for reducing medical errors. Utilizing an innovative a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach combining with case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques, we propose to develop a knowledgebase and learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, linking historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews on patient safety. We envision that the innovative approach will facilitate timely, quality reporting and learning from the incidents and ultimately cultivating a just and learning culture of patient safety.",Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit,8928596,R01HS022895,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2015,249655,0.03969777249632025
"Construction of Relation Detection Framework Empowered by Topic Modeling     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The availability of large volume of EHRs enhances the possibility for using them for health services, EBM and clinical research. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as relation detections between medical events among unstructured EHRs still pose a big challenge, consequently leading to the inaccuracy of patient cohort identification, especially for cross-institutional environment. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that topic modeling can discover data semantics, which can then be employed as significant cues for diverse relation detections among EHRs. Among them, co-referring, temporal relations and domain semantics are intertwined and positively correlated. Up to now, not much research is done to combine the three relations to build a better patient cohort identification system. Therefore, the PI proposes to develop a relation detection framework for EHRs empowered with topic modeling for more accurate patient cohort identification. In the mentored phase, the PI will implement the relation detection framework under the guidance of my mentor team and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross-institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develo a hybrid design with ICD-9, RxNorm and MeSH ontologies for the data semantics discoveries from EHRs and MedLINE respectively and investigate categorization of data semantics aligning with medical ontologies (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources and more importantly to make corrections or adjustments on data semantics, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The independent phase will be in collaboration with both UTHealth and University of Maryland. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on relation detections among EHRs for efficient patient cohort identification. The PI has strong background in computational linguistics and rich experiences in medical clinical records processing and analyses, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, and Terry Therneau, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored phase will be in Mayo Clinic Rochester where the PI will undertake courses in US healthcare system, health system engineering, clinical statistics and clinical epidemiology and will get mentored training in health informatics which is what he needs to continue to strengthen since he didn't get regular training in his PhD education. In the independent R00 phase, the PI will strive for making independent scientific contributions to the use of informatics for healthcare via the implementation of Aims 2 and 3 and via the independent collaborations internal and externally. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing the construction of medical knowledge systems and clinical practices as well as clinical research.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing accurate and real-time patient cohort identification is not fully realized, because corresponding relation detection systems for medical events among EHRs still need improvements. The proposed framework will enable patient cohort identification that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Informatics Tools for Pharmacogenomic Discovery using Practice-based Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for observational research. More recently, huge efforts have linked EMR databases with archived biological material, to accelerate research in personalized medicine. EMR- linked DNA biobanks have identified common and rare genetic variants that contribute to risk of disease. An appealing vision, which has not been extensively explored, is to use EMRs-linked biobanks for pharmacogenomic studies, which identify associations between genetic variation and drug efficacy and toxicity. The longitudinal nature of the data contained within EMRs make them ideal for quantifying drug outcome (both efficacy and toxicity). Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large-scale studies of treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. Despite its success, EMR-based pharmacogenomic studies are often hampered by its data-intensive nature -- it is time- consuming and costly to extract and integrate data from multiple heterogeneous EMR databases, for large-scale pharmacogenomic studies. The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) is a National Center for Biomedical Computing based at Partners Healthcare System. I2b2 has developed a scalable informatics framework to enable clinical researchers to repurpose existing EMR data for clinical and genomic discovery. In this study, we will collaborate with i2b2 to extend its informatics framework to the pharmacogenomics domain, by proposing the following specific aims: 1) Develop new methods to extract and model drug exposure and outcome information from EMR and integrate them with the i2b2 NLP components; 2) Build ontology tools to normalize and integrate pharmacogenomic data across different sites; 3) Conduct known and novel pharmacogenomic studies to evaluate and refine tools developed in Aim 1 and 2; and 4) Disseminate the developed informatics tools among pharmacogenomic researchers.

"Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing deployments of electronic health records (EHRs) systems have made massive clinical data available electronically. However, much of detailed clinical information of patients is embedded in narrative text and is not directly accessible for computerized clinical applications. Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information in narrative document, have received great attention in the medical domain. Current state-of-the-art NLP approaches often involve building probabilistic models. However, the wide adoption of statistical methods in clinical NLP faces two grand challenges: 1) the lack of large annotated clinical corpora; and 2) the lack of methodologies that can efficiently integrate linguistic and domain knowledge with statistical learning. High-performance statistical NLP methods rely on large scale and high quality annotations of clinical text, but it is time-consuming and costly to create large annotated clinica corpora as it often requires manual review by physicians. Moreover, the medical domain is knowledge intensive. To achieve optimal performance, probabilistic models need to leverage medical domain knowledge. Therefore, methods that can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost would be highly desirable for clinical text processing.    In this study, we propose to investigate interactive machine learning (IML) methods to address the above challenges in clinical NLP. An IML system builds a classification model in an iterative process, which can actively select informative samples for annotation based on models built on previously annotated samples, thus reducing the annotation cost for model development. More importantly, an IML system also involves human inputs to the learning process (e.g., an expert can specify important features for a classification task based on domain knowledge). Thus, IML is an ideal framework for efficiently integrating rule-based (via domain experts specifying features) and statistics-based (via different learning algorithms) approaches to clinical NLP. To achieve our goal, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we plan to investigate different aspects of IML for word sense disambiguation, including developing new active learning algorithms and conducting cognitive usability analysis for efficient feature annotation by users. To demonstrate the broad uses of IML, we further extend IML approaches to two other important clinical NLP classification tasks: named entity recognition and clinical phenoytping in Aim 2. Finally we propose to disseminate the IML methods and tools to the biomedical research community in Aim 3.             Project Narrative In this project, we propose to develop interactive machine learning methods to process clinical text stored in electronic health records (EHRs) systems. Such methods can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost, thus improving performance of text processors.

Clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies for automatic extraction, indexing, searching, and interpretation of EHRs are in development; however, due to privacy concerns related to EHRs, such technologies are usually developed by teams that have privileged access to EHRs in a specific institution. Technologies that are tailored to a specific set of data from a given institution generate inspiring results on that data; however, they can fail to generalize to similar data from other institutions and even other departments from the same institution. Therefore, learning from these technologies and building on them becomes difficult.          In order to improve NLP in EHRs, there is need for head-to-head comparison of approaches that can address a given task on the same data set. Shared-tasks provide one way of conducting systematic head-to- head comparisons. This proposal describes a series of shared-task challenges and conferences, spread over a five year period, that promote the development and evaluation of cutting edge clinical NLP systems by distributing de-identified EHRs to the broad research community, under data use agreements, so that:      *	the state-of-the-art in clinical NLP technologies can be identified and advanced,      *	a set of technologies that enable the use of the information contained in EHR narratives becomes available, and      *	the information from EHR narratives can be made more accessible, for example, for clinical and medical research.          The scientific activities supporting the organization of the shared-task challenges are sponsored in part by Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), grant number U54-LM008748, PI: Kohane.          This proposal aims to organize a series of workshops, conference proceedings, and journal special issues that will accompany the shared-task challenges in order to disseminate the knowledge generated by the challenges.                 Public health relevance: this proposal will address two main challenges related to the use of clinical narratives for research: availability of clinical records for research and identification of the state of the art in clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies so that we can push the state of the art forward and so that future work can build on the past.

"Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have shown promise for extracting data from the free text of electronic health records (EHRs), but studies have consistently found that techniques do not readily generalize across application settings. Unfortunately, most of the focus in applying NLP to real use cases has remained on a paradigm of single, well-defined application settings, so that generalizability to unseen use cases remains implicitly unaddressed. We propose to explicitly account for unseen application settings by adopting an information retrieval (IR) perspective with the objective of patient-level cohort identification. To do so, we introduce layered language models, an IR framework that enables the reuse of NLP-produced artifacts. Our long term goal is to accelerate investigations of patient health and disease by providing robust, user- centric tools that are necessary to process, retrieve, and utilize the free text of EHRs. The main goal of this proposal is to accurately retrieve ad hoc, realistic cohorts from clinical text at Mayo Clinic and OHSU, establishing methods, resources, and evaluation for patient-level IR. We hypothesize that cohort identification can be addressed in a generalizable fashion by a new IR framework: layered language models. We will test this hypothesis through four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will make medical NLP artifacts searchable in our layered language IR framework. This involves storing and indexing the NLP artifacts, as well as using statistical language models to retrieve documents based on text and its associated NLP artifacts. In Aim 2, we deal with the practical setting of ad hoc cohort identification, moving to patient-level (rather than document-level) IR. To accurately handle patient cohorts in which qualifying evidence may be spread over multiple documents, we will develop and implement patient-level retrieval models that account for cross- document relational and temporal combinations of events. In Aim 3, we will construct parallel IR test collections using EHR data from two sites; a diverse set of cohort queries written by multiple people toward various clinical or epidemiological ends; and assessments of which patients are relevant to which queries at both sites. Finally, in Aim 4, we refine and evaluate patient-level layered language IR on the ad hoc cohort identification task, making comparisons across the users, queries, optimization metrics, and institutions. We will draw additional extrinsic comparisons with pre-existing techniques, e.g., for cohorts from the Electronic Medical Records and Genonmics network. The expected outcomes of the proposed work are: (i) An open-source cohort identification tool, usable by clinicians and epidemiologists, that makes principled use of NLP artifacts for unseen queries; ii) A parallel test collection for cohort identification, includig two intra-institutional document collections, diverse test topics and user-produced text queries, and patient-level judgments of relevance to each query; and (iii) Validation of the reusability of medical NLP via the task of retrieving patient cohorts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  With the widespread adoption of electronic medical records, one might expect that it would be simple for a medical expert to find things like ""patients in the community who suffer from asthma."" Unfortunately, on top of lab tests, medications, and demographic information, there are observations that a physician writes down as text - which are difficult for a computer to understand. Therefore, we aim to process text so that a computer can understand enough of it, and then search that text along with the rest of a patient's medical record; this will allow clinicians or researchers to find and study patients groups of interest.                ",Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification,8811565,R01LM011934,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Asthma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Institution', 'Interest Group', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Smoke', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Writing', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'cohort', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'syntax', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2014,460688,0.0529927541018058
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications  PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develop a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Natural language processing for clinical and translational research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for clinical and translational research. This growth is being fueled by recent federal legislation that provides generous financial incentives to institutions demonstrating aggressive application and ""meaningful use"" of comprehensive EMRs. Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large scale studies of disease onset and treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. However, a well-known challenge for secondary use of EMR data for clinical and translational research is that much of detailed patient information is embedded in narrative text. Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, which are able to convert unstructured clinical text into coded data, have been introduced into the biomedical domain and have demonstrated promising results. Researchers have used NLP systems to identify clinical syndromes and common biomedical concepts from radiology reports, discharge summaries, problem lists, nursing documentation, and medical education documents. Different NLP systems have been developed at different institutions and utilized to convert clinical narrative text into structured data that may be used for other clinical applications and studies. Successful stories in applying NLP to clinical and translational research have been reported widely. However, institutions often deploy different NLP systems, which produce various types of output formats and make it difficult to exchange information between sites. Therefore, the lack of interoperability among different clinical NLP systems becomes a bottleneck for efficient multi-site studies. In addition, many successful studies often require a strong interdisciplinary team where informaticians and clinicians have to work very closely to iteratively define optimal algorithms for clinical phenotypes. As intensive informatics support may not be available to every clinical researcher, the usability of NLP systems for end users is another important issue. The proposed project builds upon first-hand knowledge and experience across the research team in the use of NLP for clinical and translational research projects. There are several big informatics initiatives for clinical and translational research but those initiatives generally assume one shoe fits all and follow top-down approaches to develop NLP solutions. Complementary to those initiatives, we will use a bottom-up approach to handle interoperability and usability: i) we will obtain a common NLP data model and exchange format through empirical analysis of existing NLP systems and NLP results; ii) we will develop a user-centric NLP front end interface for NLP systems wrapped to be consistent with the proposed NLP data model and exchange format incorporating usability analysis into the agile development process.

"Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams  PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Timely detection of severe patient conditions or concerning events and their mitigation remains an important problem in clinical practice. This is especially true in the critically ill patient. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming, costly, and difficult to extract and implement such knowledge in existing monitoring systems. The research work in this proposal offers computational, rather than expert-based, solutions that build alert systems from data stored in patient data repositories, such as electronic medical records. Briefly, our approach uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify unusual clinical management patterns in individual patients, relative to patterns associated with comparable patients, and raises an alert signaling this discrepancy. Our previous studies provide support that such deviations indicate clinically important events at false alert rates below 50%, which is very promising. We propose to further improve the new methodology, and build a real-time monitoring and alerting system integrated with production electronic medical records. We propose an evaluation of the system using physicians' assessment of alerts raised by our real-time system for intensive-care unit (ICU) patient cases. The project investigators comprise a multidisciplinary team with expertise in critical care medicine, computer science, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, knowledge based systems, and clinical data repositories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors in the intensive care unit (ICU). This project develops and evaluates a new clinical monitoring and alerting framework that uses electronic medical records and machine-learning methods to send alerts concerning clinical decisions in the ICU that are unexpected given the clinical context and may represent medical errors.                ",Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams,8641014,R01GM088224,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electronics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Practice Management', 'Production', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Stream', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'design', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'liver transplantation', 'multidisciplinary', 'prototype', 'public health relevance']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,580180,0.021815935178973535
"Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers. Me    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Computer-assisted medicine is at a crossroads: medical care requires accurate data, but making such data widely available can create unacceptable risks to the privacy of individual patients. This tension between utility and privacy is especially acute in predictive personalized medicine (PPM). PPM holds the promise of making treatment decisions tailored to the individual based on her or his particular genetics and clinical history. Making PPM a reality requires running statistical, data mining and machine learning algorithms on combined genetic, clinical and demographic data to construct predictive models. Access to such data directly competes with the need for healthcare providers to protect the privacy of each patient's data, thus creating a tradeoff between model efficacy and privacy. Thus we find ourselves in an unfortunate standoff: significant medical advances that would result from more powerful mining of the data by a wider variety of researchers are hindered by significant privacy concerns on behalf of the patients represented in the data set. In this proposed work, we seek to develop and evaluate technology to resolve this standoff, enabling health practitioners and researchers to compute on privacy-sensitive medical records in order to make treatment decisions or create accurate models, while protecting patient privacy. We will evaluate our approach on a de-identified actual electronic medical record, with an average of 29 years of clinical history on each patient, and with detailed genetic data (650K SNPs) available for a subset of 5000 of the patients. This data set is available to us now through the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative, but only on a computer at the Marshfield Clinic. If successful our approach will make possible the sharing of this cutting-edge data set, and others like it that are now in development, including our ability to analyze this data at UW-Madison where we have thousands of processors available in our Condor pool. Our privacy approach integrates secure data access environments, including those appropriate to the use of laptops and cloud computing, with novel anonymization algorithms providing differential privacy guarantees for data and/or published results of data analysis. To this end, our specific aims are as follows:       AIM 1: Develop and deploy a secure local environment that, in combination with secure network functionality, will ensure end-to-end security and privacy for electronic medical records and biomedical datasets shared between clinical institutions and researchers.       AIM 2: Develop and deploy a secure virtual environment to allow large-scale, privacy-preserving data analysis ""in the cloud.""       AIM 3: Develop and evaluate privacy-preserving data mining algorithms for use with original (not anonymized) data sets consisting of electronic medical records and genetic data.       AIM 4: Develop and evaluate anonymizing data publishing algorithms and privacy guarantees that are appropriate to the complex structure present in electronic medical records with genetic data.            Project Narrative This project will develop an integrated approach to secure sharing of clinical and genetic data that based on algorithms for anonymization of data to achieve differential privacy guarantees, for privacy-preserving publication of data analysis results, and secure environments for data sharing that include addressing the increasing use of laptops and of cloud computing. The end goal of this project is to meet the competing demands of providing patients with both privacy and accurate predictive models based on clinical history and genetics. This project includes the first concrete evaluation of privacy- preserving data mining algorithms on actual combined EMR and genetic data, using with the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative data set.",Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers.

"Utilizing social media as a resource for mental health surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major depressive disorder is one of the most common debilitating illnesses in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Currently, nationwide mental health surveillance takes the form of large-scale telephone- based surveys. These surveys have high running costs and require teams of human telephone operators. Even the largest system, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, reaches only 0.13% of the US population. Twitter (and other microblog services) offers a rich, if terse, multilingual source of real time data for public health surveillance. Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides techniques and resources to ""unlock"" data from text. We propose using Twitter and NLP as a cost-effective and flexible approach to augmenting current telephone- based surveillance methods for population level depression monitoring.         This grant application has two major strands. First, investigating ethical issues and challenges to privacy that emerge with the use of Twitter data for public health surveillance (Aim One). Second, developing techniques and resources for real-time public health surveillance for mental illness from Twitter (Aim Two &Aim Three). Aim One seeks to investigate and codify our responsibilities as researchers towards Twitter users by engaging with those users directly. With Aim Two, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing resources - algorithms, lexicons and taxonomies - to support the identification of depression symptoms in Twitter data. For Aim Three, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing modules and services that use Twitter as a data source for monitoring depression levels in the community. The significance of the proposed work lies in three areas. First, our investigations - both empirical and theoretical - will explore ethical issues in the use of Twitter for public health surveillance. This work has the potential to guide future research in the area. Second, in developing and evaluating algorithms and resources for identifying depression from tweets, we are contributing foundational work to the field of NLP. Third, developing these algorithms and resources will provide the bedrock for building social media based surveillance systems which will provide a cost effective means of augmenting current mental health surveillance practice.

"Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records  Health information technology (HIT) can lower costs, strengthen productivity, and promote safety. To realize such benefits on a large scale, healthcare organizations (HCOs) are adopting electronic health records (EHRs) to provide various capabilities. Yet, as EHRs and the healthcare workforce grow in diversity, so does their complexity. This is a concern because evidence suggests complex HIT can interrupt care delivery, contribute to medical errors, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. Moreover, such events tend to be discovered only after they transpire en masse, leading to negative media coverage, loss of patients' trust, and sanctions. Federal regulations now enable patients to receive accountings of who accessed their medical records during treatment, payment, and operations related activities. Yet, for patients to make sense of such accountings, they need to be provided with explanations regarding the extent to which accesses are normal in the context of routine HCO activities. We believe that relating specific accesses to patterns of healthcare operations can help explain how medical records are utilized. Unfortunately, many of the aforementioned problems manifest because EHR utilization patterns rarely guide the design and refinement of healthcare management practices. Thus, the overarching objective of our research is to develop novel strategies to automatically learn HCO behavior based on EHR usage. The past several years has witnessed a flurry of activity in this field, but it remains in its infancy and has only scratched the surface of care patterns and the types of anomalies that can be detected. Through this project, we propose to develop anomaly detection methods that integrate the semantics of healthcare operations and allow for the detection of workflows over time. This will enable HCOs and patients to audit in a meaningful way. Moreover, we believe the innovation and dissemination of such data mining strategies will enable HCOs to detect anomalous events that indicate system misuse and patients who require special attention, but also effectively audit business practices and discover inefficient workflows. The specific aims of this project are (1) to develop machine learning approaches, based on intrasession utilization patterns, to streamline EHR interface configuration and detect anomalous sessions, (2) to design a data mining framework, based on intersession EHR access patterns, to characterize HCO departmental interactions in patient treatment and detect anomalous events, and (3) to infer patient management pathways to consolidate redundant processes and detect deviations from anticipated workflows. In support of these goals, we will evaluate, compare, and contrast the workflows and anomalies in the EHR systems of two large medical centers. Additionally, we will ensure that our methods are integrated into an open source software system that can assist HCOs to extract, transform, and load (ETL) access data from EHRs, analyze such data for anomalies, and visualize the results in interfaces that enable review by healthcare administrators and patients. In doing so, we will be able to compare and contrast behavior of the workflows and multiple institutions and develop methods that appropriately generalize across EHR systems.  As electronic health record systems, and healthcare organizations, grow in diversity, so do their complexity, which can lead to inefficient documentation, management of patients, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. In this research, we will develop technologies, to be disseminated through an open source software suite, to learn patterns associated with healthcare operations, upon which anomaly detection techniques can be based. The specific goals of this project are to 1) model HCO users' intrasession behaviors when interacting with an EHR, 2) learn interdepartmental relations based on the accesses of common patients, and 3) infer patient management pathways based on the sequence of accesses to a patient's record.",Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records,8694383,R01LM010207,"['Accounting', 'Administrator', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Interdepartmental Relations', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Neonatal Intensive Care', 'Neonatology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Patterns of Care', 'Phase', 'Practice Management', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Simulate', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'comparative', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health information technology', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'payment', 'programs', 'software systems', 'ward']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,392500,0.023409846394321646
"Interactive Search and Review of Clinical Records with Multi-layered Semantic Ann    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A critical element of translating science into practice is the ability to find patient populations for clinical research. Many studies rely on administrative data for selecting relevant patients for studies of comparative effectiveness, but the limitations of administrative data is well-known. Much of the information critical for clinical research is locked in free-text dictated reports, such as history and physical exams and radiology reports. Data repositories, such as the Medical Archival Retrieval System (MARS) at the University of Pittsburgh, are useful for identifying supersets of patients for clinical research studies through indexed word searches. However, simple text-based queries are also limited in their effectiveness, and researchers are often left reading through hundreds or thousands of reports to filter out false positive cases. Current processes are time-consuming and extraordinarily expensive. They lead to long delays between the development of a testable hypothesis and the ability to share findings with the medical community at large.       A potential solution to this problem is pre-annotating de-identified clinical reports to facilitate more intelligent and sophisticated retrieval and review. Clinical reports are rich in meaning and structure and can be annotated at many different levels using natural language processing technology. It is not clear, however, what types of annotations would be most helpful to a clinical researcher, nor is it clear how to display the annotations to best assist manual review of reports. There is interdependence between the annotation schema used by an NLP system and the user interface for assisting researchers in retrieving data for retrospective studies. In this proposal, we will interactively revise an NLP annotation schema as well as explore various methods for annotation display based on feedback from users reviewing patient data for specific research studies.       We hypothesize that an interactive search application that relies on NLP-annotated clinical text will increase the accuracy and efficiency of finding patients for clinical research studies and will support visualization techniques for viewing the data in a way that improves a researcher's ability to review patient data.              Narrative We will develop a novel review application for this proposal that will facilitate translational research from secondary use of EHR data by assisting researchers in more efficiently finding retrospective populations of patients for clinical research studies. The application will rely both on multi-layered annotation of the textual data, using natural langauge processing, and on coordinated views of the patient data.",Interactive Search and Review of Clinical Records with Multi-layered Semantic Ann,8714052,R01LM010964,"['Automated Annotation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Feedback', 'Imagery', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'base', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computer human interaction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'research study', 'success']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2014,579144,0.021814631317176942
"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted.                  Narrative This project is focused on generating a longitudinal health record for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials.

"InfoMediator: Weaving Clinical Expertise in Online Health Communities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic illness can be overwhelming to patients because it impacts many areas of their daily lives. Accordingly, many patients turn to online health support groups to get social support. In face-to-face patient support groups (F2F), health professional moderators provide clinical expertise within the context of peer-patients' sharing of experience. However, in online health community settings, because health professionals' time and resources are expensive, it is challenging to get health professionals' opinions for thousands of messages posted each day. To solve this problem, I propose to develop methods and techniques that maximize the use of already available clinical expertise online for online peer-patient conversation threads by developing a system, InfoMediator. The InfoMediator will semi-automatically weave health professionals' existing answers to patients' questions into peer-patient conversations by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques complemented by user feedback. As the career development component of this proposal, I deepen my skills and knowledge in NLP necessary for proposed work and patient education. As I develop the NLP techniques and knowledge in patient education, I and my mentors will develop methods and techniques that address weaving clinical expertise within peer-patient conversations by designing, implementing, and evaluating socio-technical aspects of the InfoMediator. The training opportunities provided by this NIH NLM K01 grant, together with the supportive research environment at Michigan State University, will help further extend my existing expertise in human-computer interaction, design, and health informatics to establish my independent informatics research program in patient-centered technologies. Focusing on persons with diabetes, the outcomes of the proposed research will help us understand how to empower persons with diabetes to improve self- efficacy and self-care, while increasing the quality of online health information environment.             8.

"Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports  Abstract Communication of clinically important follow-up recommendations when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. The absence of an automated system to identify and track radiology follow-up recommendations is an important barrier to ensuring timely follow-up of patients, especially for non-acute but potentially life threatening and unexpected findings. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to extract clinically important recommendation information from free-text radiology reports. Each radiology report will be preprocessed at the structural, syntactic, and semantic level to generate features that will be used to extract the boundaries of sentences that include recommendation information as well as the details of reason for recommendation, requested imaging test, and recommendation time frame. We will use a large corpus of free-text radiology reports represented by a mixture of modalities (e.g., radiography, computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) from three different institutions. Using this dataset we will perform the following specific aims: Aim 1. Create a multi- institutional radiology report corpus annotated for clinically important recommendation information; Aim 2. Develop a novel NLP system to extract clinically important recommendations in radiology reports. The proposed research is innovative because it will generate a new text processing approach that can be used to flag reports visually and electronically so that separate workflow processes can be initiated to reduce the chance that necessary investigations or interventions suggested in the report are missed by clinicians. The proposed set of tools will be disseminated to the biomedical informatics community as open source tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Communication of recommendations for necessary investigations and interventions when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. When recommendations are not systematically identified and promptly communicated to referrers, poor patient outcomes can result. We propose to build natural language processing tools to automatically extract clinically important recommendation information from radiology reports.                ",Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports,8635902,R21EB016872,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidental Findings', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Lung nodule', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Washington', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer care', 'care delivery', 'design', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2014,257300,0.017123443958806127
"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported.                 Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",8760594,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'programs', 'tool', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2014,398307,0.03690607077009792
"Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and healthcare, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring a huge cost. The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance  patient safety and reduce costs by discovering novel serious ADRs through use of automated methods that  combine information from large and varied patient populations as well as from the literature. There have been  considerable advances in pharmacovigilance, but more work is needed. For example, Vioxx, a commonly used  drug, was recently found to cause at least 88,000 occurrences of myocardial infarction, highlighting the  insufficiency of current methods. To date, methods have mainly depended on the use of single sources of data,  primarily from the Federal Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and from  electronic health records (EHRS). Although important, each of the sources has different limitations and  advantages, and therefore, combining the data across them should lead to more effective drug safety  surveillance by increasing the statistical power, and also by allowing each data source to complement the other  sources. We already have developed methods associated with each of the single sources, and therefore, this  is an excellent opportunity to build upon our research accomplishments to advance the state of the art in  pharmacovigilance.   More specifically, we will a) acquire and combine comprehensive clinical data from the electronic health  records (EHRs) of two different health care sites serving diverse populations by utilizing natural language  processing (NLP) to obtain vast quantities of fine-grained data, and then by developing data mining  methodologies on the clinical data to detect novel ADR signals, b) analyze differences in therapy-related risk  factors between the two EHR populations, such as racial and ethnic differences, c) detect ADR signals in the  FAERS database using an established methodology, d) develop improved methods to acquire ADR signals  based on information in the literature, and e) develop methods that utilize the results from the above sources to  maximize effectiveness. We will focus on eight serious ADRs, and collect a high-quality reference standard for  those ADRs so that we will be able to evaluate and compare performance of the different detection methods  individually as well as the methods that combine the sources.   This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods, which  are primarily based on use of individual sources of data. We are confident the methods will be effective  because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in  this proposal presents an excellent chance to leverage heterogeneous data sources to dramatically improve  patient safety and reduce costs. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and health care, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring huge costs, and, therefore, continuous post-marketing surveillance  is crucial for patient safety. This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by  developing effective methods to discover new adverse drug reactions through the combination of information in  the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System, the literature, and comprehensive clinical data from electronic  health records of two different sites with diverse populations, thereby overcoming limitations that rely mainly on  use of one data source.",Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data,8660067,R01LM010016,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Probability', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data mining', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'prevent', 'racial/ethnic difference', 'research and development', 'text searching']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2014,417795,-0.0018174852665719511
"Genetic Discovery and  Application in a Clinical Setting Continuing a Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle eMERGE project aims to bring personal genomics to practice settings by taking advantage of the extensive electronic medical record (EMR) and biorepository of Group Health Cooperative (GH), including a 33-year pharmacy database and longitudinal data on an aging population. Algorithms developed in eMERGE I will be used to combine genome-wide association studies with phenotypes mined from EMRs to discover new polymorphism-phenotype relationships. Target phenotypes are infectious disease susceptibility, specifically to Clostridium difficile diarrhea, shingles from varicella zoster virus, and fungal nail infection, responses to antihypertensive drugs, serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, and statins, including adverse events. A new algorithm will follow longitudinal glycemia and hematocrit trajectories, and a novel automated method will detect karyotype abnormalities for assessing correlation to myelodysplasia and leukemia. Data will also support phenotypes investigated at other eMERGE sites. To create a model for introducing genomics into clinical practice, successful needs assessment methods from eMERGE I will engage stakeholders in guiding development of prototype EMR user interfaces in a clinical decision support format. The test case will be human leukocyte antigen-typing for an adverse drug reaction and the setting will be the patient-centered medical home care model developed at GH. This proposal provides the eMERGE network and its collaborators with the Seattle team's unique expertise in using natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from EMRs, and assisting in adoption of NLP methods. To disseminate eMERGE results and foster collaborations, it takes advantage of leadership positions of the investigators, including partners within eMERGE, other consortia and the HMO Research network, especially the potential for developments supported by the NIH Director's Common Fund in biobanking and megaepidemiology.

"Encoding and Processing Patient Allergy Information in EHRs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allergies affect one in five Americans and are the 5th leading chronic disease in the U.S. Each year, allergies account for more than 17 million outpatient office visits. Although documenting and exchanging allergy information in electronic health records (EHRs) is becoming increasingly important, we still face multiple challenges. These include: lack of well-adopted standard terminologies for representing allergies, frequent entry of allergy information as free-text, and no existing process for reconciling allergy information. In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) conduct analyses on standard terminologies and a large allergy repository to build a comprehensive knowledge base for representing allergy information; 2) design, develop and evaluate a natural language processing (NLP) module for extracting and encoding free-text allergy information and integrate it with an existing NLP system; 3) measure the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed NLP system for the new process of allergy reconciliation; and 4) distribute our methods and tool, so they are widely available to other researchers and healthcare institutions for non-commercial use.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Managing allergy information within the electronic health record (EHR) is vital to ensuring patient safety. The goal of this study is to propose a comprehensive solution to assess existing terminology standards and knowledge bases for representing allergy information, develop and evaluate a natural language processing (NLP) system for extracting and encoding allergy information from free-text clinical documents, and finally measure the feasibility of using NLP output to facilitate the allergy reconciliation proces.

"Improving Accuracy of Electronic Notes Using A Faster, Simpler Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physician progress notes contain information essential to patient care, including findings from history and physical exam, interpretation of tests, assessment and treatment plans. However in the transition from paper to electronic physician notes, many physicians spend more time creating them, which has led to the use of time-saving measures such as copy/paste and templates that have degraded note accuracy and quality. This threatens the usefulness of notes not only for their most important use-patient care-but also for research, quality improvement, and in supporting reimbursement. To address these problems, we propose a project with the following specific aims: 1. To refine and implement a new voice-generated enhanced electronic note system (VGEENS) integrating voice recognition with natural language processing and links to the electronic medical record (EMR) to improve note accuracy and timeliness. 2. To evaluate VGEENS using a randomized trial with 30 internal medicine physicians in each arm to assess electronic note accuracy, quality, timeliness, and user satisfaction. Intervention physicians will use VGEENS, while the control physicians will continue with note creation as they normally would. This novel approach has the potential to improve note accuracy while reducing delays in making progress notes in EMRs available to other clinicians. It leverages rapidly improving voice recognition and NLP technologies to permit physicians to use a natural, fast method-human voice-to convey their observation and thoughts into the EMR record.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physician documentation of a patient visit contains information that is used in that patient's care. This information includes findings from a patient' history and physical exam, interpretation of necessary tests, the problem assessment and treatment plan. However, in the transition from paper to electronic physician notes, many physicians are spending more time creating these notes. This has led to use of time-saving measures that have degraded the accuracy and ease of use of patient notes. By the end of this project, we expect to have developed, used and evaluated a new method for creating electronic physician notes that both improve accuracy and timely availability of inpatient progress notes.            ","Improving Accuracy of Electronic Notes Using A Faster, Simpler Approach",8805997,R21HS023631,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2014,154347,0.027782728030509976
"Automated Dynamic Lists for Efficient Electronic Health Record Management DESCRIPTION (provided by APPLICANT): Medical errors are recognized as the cause of numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many are preventable. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information in the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of the information available in the EHR is only mentioned in narrative clinical documents. Electronic lists of problems and allergies are available in most EHRs, but they require manual management by their users, to add new problems, modify existing ones, and the removal of the ones that are irrelevant. Consequently, these electronic lists are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. Clinacuity, Inc. proposes to develop a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the EHR of patients suffering from cancer. To establish the merit and feasibility of such a system, we will work on the following objectives: 1) create a reference standard for training and testing the information extraction application, a reference standard including a random sample of de-identified clinical narratives from patients treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute Cancer Clinics (Salt Lake City, Utah), with problems and allergies annotated by domain experts; 2) develop a prototype to automatically extract medical problems and allergies, implementing a novel stepwise hybrid approach to maximize sensitivity first, and also enhance positive predictive value; and 3) test the prototype with the aforementioned reference standard, using a cross-validation approach for training and testing. Commercial application: The system Clinacuity proposes will not only help healthcare providers maintain complete and timely lists of problems and allergies, providing them with an efficient overview of a patient, but also help healthcare organizations attain meaningful use requirements. The proposed system has potential commercial applications in inpatient and outpatient settings, increasing the efficiency of busy healthcare providers by saving time, and aiding healthcare organizations in demonstrating ""meaningful use"" and obtaining Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services incentive payments.

"Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical error is one of the leading causes of death in the US. The study and reduction of medical errors have become a major concern in healthcare today. It is believed that medical error reporting systems could be a good resource to share and to learn from errors if medical error data are collected in a properly structured format and are useful for the detection of patterns, discovery of underlying factors, and generation of solutions. Effectively gathering information from previous lessons and timely informing the subsequent action are the two major goals for the design, development and utilization of such a system. The Common Formats (CFs) suggested by AHRQ tend to unify the future reporting format, which holds promise in improving data consistency and reducing unsafe conditions through lessons learned. However, effective gathering medical incident data does not merely rely on a unified structure. To be able to learn from previous lessons, it heavily depends upon the quality reports and learning features offered by systems. Medical incident data are always the key components and invaluable assets in patient safety research. The long term goal of the project is to understand the occurrence and causes of medical incidents in real practice and to develop interventions based on collection of incident reports to minimize the recurrence of similar incidents that have been reported. The objective of this application is to improve the utilization f voluntary reporting systems that each healthcare institution has been put in use by developing a learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, automatically link historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews in patient safety. As moving toward CFs, the researchers propose a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach that will help reporters generate complete and accurate reports through user-friendly guidance and offer timely comments and relevant peer reviews through educational tools during and after incident reporting. The researchers employ a case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the knowledge-based toolkit which helps reporters improve the communication about patient safety through clear working definitions and advance training that builds knowledge about the safety culture and then provides continuing education through the system. The project holds promise in revolutionizing the design of voluntary medical incident reporting systems from an incident data repository to an advanced resource promoting complete and accurate incident reporting and learning toward a just and learning culture.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Timely reporting and effective learning from medical incidents is considered an effective way in developing strategies for reducing medical errors. Utilizing an innovative a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach combining with case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques, we propose to develop a knowledgebase and learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, linking historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews on patient safety. We envision that the innovative approach will facilitate timely, quality reporting and learning from the incidents and ultimately cultivating a just and learning culture of patient safety.            ",Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit,8818528,R01HS022895,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2014,249655,0.03969777249632025
"Informatics Tools for Pharmacogenomic Discovery using Practice-based Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for observational research. More recently, huge efforts have linked EMR databases with archived biological material, to accelerate research in personalized medicine. EMR- linked DNA biobanks have identified common and rare genetic variants that contribute to risk of disease. An appealing vision, which has not been extensively explored, is to use EMRs-linked biobanks for pharmacogenomic studies, which identify associations between genetic variation and drug efficacy and toxicity. The longitudinal nature of the data contained within EMRs make them ideal for quantifying drug outcome (both efficacy and toxicity). Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large-scale studies of treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. Despite its success, EMR-based pharmacogenomic studies are often hampered by its data-intensive nature -- it is time- consuming and costly to extract and integrate data from multiple heterogeneous EMR databases, for large-scale pharmacogenomic studies. The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) is a National Center for Biomedical Computing based at Partners Healthcare System. I2b2 has developed a scalable informatics framework to enable clinical researchers to repurpose existing EMR data for clinical and genomic discovery. In this study, we will collaborate with i2b2 to extend its informatics framework to the pharmacogenomics domain, by proposing the following specific aims: 1) Develop new methods to extract and model drug exposure and outcome information from EMR and integrate them with the i2b2 NLP components; 2) Build ontology tools to normalize and integrate pharmacogenomic data across different sites; 3) Conduct known and novel pharmacogenomic studies to evaluate and refine tools developed in Aim 1 and 2; and 4) Disseminate the developed informatics tools among pharmacogenomic researchers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Longitudinal electronic medical records (EMRs) linked with DNA biobanks have become valuable resources for genomic and pharmacogenomics research, allowing identification of associations between genetic variations and drug efficacy and toxicity.

"Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) contain useful information that is difficult to automatically extract, index, search, or interpret. Clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies for automatic extraction, indexing, searching, and interpretation of EHRs are in development; however, due to privacy concerns related to EHRs, such technologies are usually developed by teams that have privileged access to EHRs in a specific institution. Technologies that are tailored to a specific set of data from a given institution generate inspiring results on that data; however, they can fail to generalize to similar data from other institutions and even other departments from the same institution. Therefore, learning from these technologies and building on them becomes difficult.          In order to improve NLP in EHRs, there is need for head-to-head comparison of approaches that can address a given task on the same data set. Shared-tasks provide one way of conducting systematic head-to- head comparisons. This proposal describes a series of shared-task challenges and conferences, spread over a five year period, that promote the development and evaluation of cutting edge clinical NLP systems by distributing de-identified EHRs to the broad research community, under data use agreements, so that:      *	the state-of-the-art in clinical NLP technologies can be identified and advanced,      *	a set of technologies that enable the use of the information contained in EHR narratives becomes available, and      *	the information from EHR narratives can be made more accessible, for example, for clinical and medical research.

"Natural language processing for clinical and translational research     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for clinical and translational research. This growth is being fueled by recent federal legislation that provides generous financial incentives to institutions demonstrating aggressive application and ""meaningful use"" of comprehensive EMRs. Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large scale studies of disease onset and treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. However, a well-known challenge for secondary use of EMR data for clinical and translational research is that much of detailed patient information is embedded in narrative text. Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, which are able to convert unstructured clinical text into coded data, have been introduced into the biomedical domain and have demonstrated promising results. Researchers have used NLP systems to identify clinical syndromes and common biomedical concepts from radiology reports, discharge summaries, problem lists, nursing documentation, and medical education documents. Different NLP systems have been developed at different institutions and utilized to convert clinical narrative text into structured data that may be used for other clinical applications and studies. Successful stories in applying NLP to clinical and translational research have been reported widely. However, institutions often deploy different NLP systems, which produce various types of output formats and make it difficult to exchange information between sites. Therefore, the lack of interoperability among different clinical NLP systems becomes a bottleneck for efficient multi-site studies. In addition, many successful studies often require a strong interdisciplinary team where informaticians and clinicians have to work very closely to iteratively define optimal algorithms for clinical phenotypes. As intensive informatics support may not be available to every clinical researcher, the usability of NLP systems for end users is another important issue. The proposed project builds upon first-hand knowledge and experience across the research team in the use of NLP for clinical and translational research projects. There are several big informatics initiatives for clinical and translational research but those initiatives generally assume one shoe fits all and follow top-down approaches to develop NLP solutions. Complementary to those initiatives, we will use a bottom-up approach to handle interoperability and usability: i) we will obtain a common NLP data model and exchange format through empirical analysis of existing NLP systems and NLP results; ii) we will develop a user-centric NLP front end interface for NLP systems wrapped to be consistent with the proposed NLP data model and exchange format incorporating usability analysis into the agile development process. All deliverables will be distributed through the open health NLP (OHNLP) consortium which we intend to make it more open and inclusive.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for clinical and translational research.

"Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictio DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An unsolved problem in health informatics is how to apply the past experiences of patients, stored in large-scale medical records systems, to predict the outcomes of patients and to individualize care. One approach to prediction, heretofore impractical, is rapidly finding a patient cohort ""similar enough"" to an index case that the health experiences and outcomes of this cohort are informative for prediction. This task is formidable because of large variability of the vast numbers of patient attributes with the added complexity of sequences of patient encounters evolving over time. Epidemiological considerations such as confounding by indication for treatment also come into play. The objective of this research effort is to (1) create a modular test bed that uses a ""big data"" systems architecture to support research in rapid individualized prediction of outcomes from large clinical repositories and (2) to  explore various approaches to making ""pragmatic"" near-term predictions of outcomes. Using the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Informatics and Computing Infrastructure database (VINCI), a research database with records of tens of millions of patients, we will explore two synergistic strategies for rapidly finding a cohort of patients that are similar enough to an index  patient to predict near-term treatment response and/or adverse effects in an elastic cloud environment: 1) use of temporal alignment of critical events including use of gene sequence alignment methods to relax requirements for exact temporal matching; and, 2) use of conceptual distance metrics to model the degree of content similarity of case records. The initial domain of application will be treatment of Type 2 diabetes. The approach will apply open source ""big data"" methodologies, including Hadoop and Accumulo, to store and filter ""medical log"" files.

"Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers. Me    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Computer-assisted medicine is at a crossroads: medical care requires accurate data, but making such data widely available can create unacceptable risks to the privacy of individual patients. This tension between utility and privacy is especially acute in predictive personalized medicine (PPM). PPM holds the promise of making treatment decisions tailored to the individual based on her or his particular genetics and clinical history. Making PPM a reality requires running statistical, data mining and machine learning algorithms on combined genetic, clinical and demographic data to construct predictive models. Access to such data directly competes with the need for healthcare providers to protect the privacy of each patient's data, thus creating a tradeoff between model efficacy and privacy. Thus we find ourselves in an unfortunate standoff: significant medical advances that would result from more powerful mining of the data by a wider variety of researchers are hindered by significant privacy concerns on behalf of the patients represented in the data set. In this proposed work, we seek to develop and evaluate technology to resolve this standoff, enabling health practitioners and researchers to compute on privacy-sensitive medical records in order to make treatment decisions or create accurate models, while protecting patient privacy. We will evaluate our approach on a de-identified actual electronic medical record, with an average of 29 years of clinical history on each patient, and with detailed genetic data (650K SNPs) available for a subset of 5000 of the patients. This data set is available to us now through the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative, but only on a computer at the Marshfield Clinic. If successful our approach will make possible the sharing of this cutting-edge data set, and others like it that are now in development, including our ability to analyze this data at UW-Madison where we have thousands of processors available in our Condor pool. Our privacy approach integrates secure data access environments, including those appropriate to the use of laptops and cloud computing, with novel anonymization algorithms providing differential privacy guarantees for data and/or published results of data analysis. To this end, our specific aims are as follows:       AIM 1: Develop and deploy a secure local environment that, in combination with secure network functionality, will ensure end-to-end security and privacy for electronic medical records and biomedical datasets shared between clinical institutions and researchers.       AIM 2: Develop and deploy a secure virtual environment to allow large-scale, privacy-preserving data analysis ""in the cloud.""       AIM 3: Develop and evaluate privacy-preserving data mining algorithms for use with original (not anonymized) data sets consisting of electronic medical records and genetic data.       AIM 4: Develop and evaluate anonymizing data publishing algorithms and privacy guarantees that are appropriate to the complex structure present in electronic medical records with genetic data.            Project Narrative This project will develop an integrated approach to secure sharing of clinical and genetic data that based on algorithms for anonymization of data to achieve differential privacy guarantees, for privacy-preserving publication of data analysis results, and secure environments for data sharing that include addressing the increasing use of laptops and of cloud computing. The end goal of this project is to meet the competing demands of providing patients with both privacy and accurate predictive models based on clinical history and genetics. This project includes the first concrete evaluation of privacy- preserving data mining algorithms on actual combined EMR and genetic data, using with the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative data set.",Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers.

"Utilizing social media as a resource for mental health surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major depressive disorder is one of the most common debilitating illnesses in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Currently, nationwide mental health surveillance takes the form of large-scale telephone- based surveys. These surveys have high running costs and require teams of human telephone operators. Even the largest system, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, reaches only 0.13% of the US population. Twitter (and other microblog services) offers a rich, if terse, multilingual source of real time data for public health surveillance. Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides techniques and resources to ""unlock"" data from text. We propose using Twitter and NLP as a cost-effective and flexible approach to augmenting current telephone- based surveillance methods for population level depression monitoring.         This grant application has two major strands. First, investigating ethical issues and challenges to privacy that emerge with the use of Twitter data for public health surveillance (Aim One). Second, developing techniques and resources for real-time public health surveillance for mental illness from Twitter (Aim Two &Aim Three). Aim One seeks to investigate and codify our responsibilities as researchers towards Twitter users by engaging with those users directly. With Aim Two, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing resources - algorithms, lexicons and taxonomies - to support the identification of depression symptoms in Twitter data. For Aim Three, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing modules and services that use Twitter as a data source for monitoring depression levels in the community. The significance of the proposed work lies in three areas. First, our investigations - both empirical and theoretical - will explore ethical issues in the use of Twitter for public health surveillance. This work has the potential to guide future research in the area. Second, in developing and evaluating algorithms and resources for identifying depression from tweets, we are contributing foundational work to the field of NLP. Third, developing these algorithms and resources will provide the bedrock for building social media based surveillance systems which will provide a cost effective means of augmenting current mental health surveillance practice. This proposal is innovative in both its application area (microblogs have not been used before for mental health surveillance), its focus on using NLP to identify depressive symptoms for public health, and in the central role that qualitative bioethical research will play in guiding the work.              Project Narrative The proposed research focuses on using advanced Natural Language Processing methods to mine microblog data - in this case, Twitter - for mental health surveillance (specifically, depression surveillance), in order to augment current telephone-based mental health surveillance systems.

"Annotation, development and evaluation for clinical information extraction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much of the clinical information required for accurate clinical research, active decision support, and broad-coverage surveillance is locked in text files in an electronic medical record (EMR). The only feasible way to leverage this information for translational science is to extract and encode the information using natural language processing (NLP). Over the last two decades, several research groups have developed NLP tools for clinical notes, but a major bottleneck preventing progress in clinical NLP is the lack of standard, annotated data sets for training and evaluating NLP applications. Without these standards, individual NLP applications abound without the ability to train different algorithms on standard annotations, share and integrate NLP modules, or compare performance. We propose to develop standards and infrastructure that can enable technology to extract scientific information from textual medical records, and we propose the research as a collaborative effort involving NLP experts across the U.S. To accomplish this goal, we will address three specific aims: Aim 1: Extend existing standards and develop new consensus standards for annotating clinical text in a way that is interoperable, extensible, and usable. Aim 2: Apply existing methods and tools, and develop new methods and tools where necessary for manually annotating a set of publicly available clinical texts in a way that is efficient and accurate. Aim 3: Develop a publicly available toolkit for automatically annotating clinical text and perform a shared evaluation to evaluate the toolkit, using evaluation metrics that are multidimensional and flexible.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research. We will experiment with methods for increasing the efficiency of annotation and will annotate de-identified reports of nine types for linguistic and clinical information. In addition, we will create an NLP toolkit that can be shared and will evaluate it against other NLP systems in a shared task evaluation with the community.

"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted.                  Narrative This project is focused on generating a longitudinal health record for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials.

"EHR-based patient safety: Automated error detection in neonatal intensive care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the field of neonatal patient safety, the paucity of systematic research is a critical barrier to progress. Notably missing are studies that meticulously investigate Electronic Health Records (EHR) and information technology in detecting neonatal intensive care-related errors. The expert panel at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHHD) identified multiple gaps in the current knowledge of neonatal patient safety research. The proposed work is a well focused response to three dimensions of the Funding Opportunity Announcement:  1.Develop prospective and retrospective study designs to collect data on patient safety and adverse events.  2.Study the strength and limitations of current methods of error reporting systems.  3.Study the usefulness of commercial IT systems and EHRs in reducing medical errors.  In our study we seek to shift patient safety research toward an automated and computerized approach to achieve a more comprehensive patient safety paradigm. We will develop novel Electronic Health Record (EHR) content-based automated algorithms that are new to patient safety research to 1) detect errors (Aim 1) and 2) categorize subsequent harm (Aim 2). State of the art information extraction and statistical classification techniques from the field of clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) will be adapted to the patient safety research tasks.  In Aim 1 we will fill the gap in the literatre by implementing a focused manual review of 700 charts (one full year of patient admissions at our institution) in one of the largest Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) in the nation. Using a trigger tool, we will identify errors occurring in three specified categories - laboratory test errrs, medication/fluid errors, and airway management errors. We will develop novel algorithms for automated EHR-based detection of the errors and evaluate the performance of the new algorithms against the performance of both trigger tool review by human chart reviewers (current gold standard) and the voluntary incident reporting system (accepted standard). In Aim 2, we will study the utility of novel EHR-based information extraction and statistical algorithms for the automated categorization of errors according to the resulting level of harm.  Our proposed work has the potential to accomplish a paradigm shift in the methods of neonatal patient safety research and practice. The study is a fundamental step to automating patient safety monitoring on a large scale and improving error identification and patient safety in NICUs for millions of children every year.          We are developing an automated error detection technique to improve the safety of newborn babies during hospital care. Our work is the first known attempt to use text analysis in the electronic health records on a large scale to reduce the cost while at the same time increase the speed and comprehensiveness of error detection in the clinical care of newborns.

"POET-2: High-performance computing for advanced clinical narrative preprocessing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This project focuses on clinical natural language processing (cNLP), a field of emerging importance in informatics. Starting with the Linguistic String Project's Medical Language Processor (New York University) in the 1970s, researchers have made steady gains in cNLP through empirical studies and by building sophisticated high-level cNLP software applications (e.g., Columbia's MedLEE). There are no fewer than four scientific conferences devoted exclusively to biomedical/clinical NLP. The cNLP literature has been growing over the past decade, and this will gain momentum as more clinical text repositories are released, such as the MIMIC II and University of Pittsburgh BLU Lab corpora.       However, sustained success in the field of cNLP is hampered by the reality that clinical texts have a far more noise than do texts traditionally studied in NLP, such as newswire articles, biomedical abstracts, and discharge summaries. Noise in this context is defined by the parseability characteristics of the language and the linguistic structures that appear in text. Clinical texts come in a striking variety of note types, with the best studied types being discharge summaries, radiology reports, and pathology reports. These note types share an important feature: they are written to communicate care issues between healthcare providers and hence typically are well-composed, well-edited, and often are dictated. But the vast majority of notes in the electronic health record are written primarily to document care issues. They communicate as well, of course, but much less care is used in their creation than with discharge summaries and reports. As a result they are often ungrammatical; are composed of short, telegraphic phrases; are replete with misspellings and shorthand (e.g., abbreviations); are ill-formatted with templates and liberal use of white space; and are embedded with ""non-prose"" (e.g., strings of laboratory values). All of these sources of noise complicate otherwise straightforward NLP tasks like tokenization, sentence segmentation, and ultimately information extraction itself.       We propose a systematic study of ways to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in clinical narratives to improve cNLP. This work extends our preliminary research (under the POET project) and has the following aims:        o Develop and implement a suite of parseability improvement tools designed for all clinical note types from multiple healthcare institutions.     o Evaluate the empirical and the functional success of the parseability improvement tools.     o Design and implement a HIPAA-compliant UlMA-based pipeline cNLP framework for use in a typical high-performance, multi-processor computing environment.              Project Narrative We can see in the multi-billion dollar investment in electronic health records (EHRs) by the ARRA that mining clinical data electronically will continue to be essential to informatics research. Most data in the EHR resides as unstructured text, and POET2 provides a means to unlock that data through combining a new, HIPAA- complaint high-performance computing architecture with sophisticated text preprocessing.",POET-2: High-performance computing for advanced clinical narrative preprocessing,8536940,R01LM010981,"['Abbreviations', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Authorization documentation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Occupations', 'Outpatients', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Proliferating', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Report (document)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Shorthand', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Summary Reports', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voting', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'data mining', 'design', 'improved', 'meetings', 'novel', 'phrases', 'pressure', 'repaired', 'repository', 'research study', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web services']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2013,292186,0.017207269079588156
"Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and healthcare, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring a huge cost. The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance  patient safety and reduce costs by discovering novel serious ADRs through use of automated methods that  combine information from large and varied patient populations as well as from the literature. There have been  considerable advances in pharmacovigilance, but more work is needed. For example, Vioxx, a commonly used  drug, was recently found to cause at least 88,000 occurrences of myocardial infarction, highlighting the  insufficiency of current methods. To date, methods have mainly depended on the use of single sources of data,  primarily from the Federal Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and from  electronic health records (EHRS). Although important, each of the sources has different limitations and  advantages, and therefore, combining the data across them should lead to more effective drug safety  surveillance by increasing the statistical power, and also by allowing each data source to complement the other  sources. We already have developed methods associated with each of the single sources, and therefore, this  is an excellent opportunity to build upon our research accomplishments to advance the state of the art in  pharmacovigilance.   More specifically, we will a) acquire and combine comprehensive clinical data from the electronic health  records (EHRs) of two different health care sites serving diverse populations by utilizing natural language  processing (NLP) to obtain vast quantities of fine-grained data, and then by developing data mining  methodologies on the clinical data to detect novel ADR signals, b) analyze differences in therapy-related risk  factors between the two EHR populations, such as racial and ethnic differences, c) detect ADR signals in the  FAERS database using an established methodology, d) develop improved methods to acquire ADR signals  based on information in the literature, and e) develop methods that utilize the results from the above sources to  maximize effectiveness. We will focus on eight serious ADRs, and collect a high-quality reference standard for  those ADRs so that we will be able to evaluate and compare performance of the different detection methods  individually as well as the methods that combine the sources.   This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods, which  are primarily based on use of individual sources of data. We are confident the methods will be effective  because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in  this proposal presents an excellent chance to leverage heterogeneous data sources to dramatically improve  patient safety and reduce costs. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and health care, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring huge costs, and, therefore, continuous post-marketing surveillance  is crucial for patient safety. This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by  developing effective methods to discover new adverse drug reactions through the combination of information in  the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System, the literature, and comprehensive clinical data from electronic  health records of two different sites with diverse populations, thereby overcoming limitations that rely mainly on  use of one data source.",Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data,8438732,R01LM010016,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Probability', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data mining', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'prevent', 'racial/ethnic difference', 'research and development', 'text searching']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2013,440117,-0.0018174852665719511
"Genetic Discovery and  Application in a Clinical Setting Continuing a Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle eMERGE project aims to bring personal genomics to practice settings by taking advantage of the extensive electronic medical record (EMR) and biorepository of Group Health Cooperative (GH), including a 33-year pharmacy database and longitudinal data on an aging population. Algorithms developed in eMERGE I will be used to combine genome-wide association studies with phenotypes mined from EMRs to discover new polymorphism-phenotype relationships. Target phenotypes are infectious disease susceptibility, specifically to Clostridium difficile diarrhea, shingles from varicella zoster virus, and fungal nail infection, responses to antihypertensive drugs, serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, and statins, including adverse events. A new algorithm will follow longitudinal glycemia and hematocrit trajectories, and a novel automated method will detect karyotype abnormalities for assessing correlation to myelodysplasia and leukemia. Data will also support phenotypes investigated at other eMERGE sites. To create a model for introducing genomics into clinical practice, successful needs assessment methods from eMERGE I will engage stakeholders in guiding development of prototype EMR user interfaces in a clinical decision support format. The test case will be human leukocyte antigen-typing for an adverse drug reaction and the setting will be the patient-centered medical home care model developed at GH. This proposal provides the eMERGE network and its collaborators with the Seattle team's unique expertise in using natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from EMRs, and assisting in adoption of NLP methods. To disseminate eMERGE results and foster collaborations, it takes advantage of leadership positions of the investigators, including partners within eMERGE, other consortia and the HMO Research network, especially the potential for developments supported by the NIH Director's Common Fund in biobanking and megaepidemiology.

"Genetic Discovery and  Application in a Clinical Setting Continuing a Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle eMERGE project aims to bring personal genomics to practice settings by taking advantage of the extensive electronic medical record (EMR) and biorepository of Group Health Cooperative (GH), including a 33-year pharmacy database and longitudinal data on an aging population. Algorithms developed in eMERGE I will be used to combine genome-wide association studies with phenotypes mined from EMRs to discover new polymorphism-phenotype relationships. Target phenotypes are infectious disease susceptibility, specifically to Clostridium difficile diarrhea, shingles from varicella zoster virus, and fungal nail infection, responses to antihypertensive drugs, serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, and statins, including adverse events. A new algorithm will follow longitudinal glycemia and hematocrit trajectories, and a novel automated method will detect karyotype abnormalities for assessing correlation to myelodysplasia and leukemia. Data will also support phenotypes investigated at other eMERGE sites. To create a model for introducing genomics into clinical practice, successful needs assessment methods from eMERGE I will engage stakeholders in guiding development of prototype EMR user interfaces in a clinical decision support format. The test case will be human leukocyte antigen-typing for an adverse drug reaction and the setting will be the patient-centered medical home care model developed at GH. This proposal provides the eMERGE network and its collaborators with the Seattle team's unique expertise in using natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from EMRs, and assisting in adoption of NLP methods. To disseminate eMERGE results and foster collaborations, it takes advantage of leadership positions of the investigators, including partners within eMERGE, other consortia and the HMO Research network, especially the potential for developments supported by the NIH Director's Common Fund in biobanking and megaepidemiology.

"Translational refinement of adaptive communication system for locked-in patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proliferation of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology promises locked-in patients potential ways to communicate successfully. Most BCI systems either involve selection from among a set of simultaneously presented stimuli, requiring extensive control of the interface; or use binary stimulus selection mechanisms that fail to achieve high communication rates because of slow intent detection or a fixed (context independent) ordering of stimuli. We propose a new interface using binary selection of text input via rapid serial visual presentation of natural language components. Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from acquired neurological disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) and neurodevelopmental disorders (cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy) drive the proposed research. Four laboratories form an alliance for this translational research project: basic research (Erdogmus, engineering; Roark, computer science and natural language processing), and clinical research (Oken, neurology/neurophysiology; Fried-Oken, augmentative communication/neurogenic communication disorders). Our aims are (1) to develop an innovative EEG-based BCI that achieves increased communication rates with fewer errors and greater satisfaction for the target SSPI populations; (2) to iteratively refine the system in the laboratory with user feedback from healthy subjects and expert LIS users of marketed AAC systems; (3) to evaluate the performance of the system within the natural clinical settings of SSPI patients. The innovative BCI is the RSVP Keyboard with three essential features: (1) rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of linguistic components ranging from letters to words to phrases; (2) a detection mechanism that employs multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and/or other suitable response mechanisms that can reliably indicate the binary intent of the user and adapt based on individualized neurophysiologic data of the user; and (3) an open-vocabulary natural language model with a capability for accurate predictions of upcoming text. Theoretical framework is based on a solid Bayesian foundation; clinical usability is based on the WHO ICF (WHO, 2001) and an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) model of participation. Rigorous experimental scrutiny in both clinical laboratory and natural settings will be obtained with able-bodied subjects and SSPI patients. Measures of learning rate, speed of message production, error rate and user satisfaction for different iterations of the RSVP keyboard will be obtained using an hypothesis-driven crossover design for 36 healthy subjects, and alternating treatment randomization design for 40 patients with SSPI. Descriptions of the motor, cognitive, and language skills of LIS patients using the novel system in their natural environments will inform clinical guidelines and functional device adaptations to better individualize treatment for children and adults with SSPI. The collaborative nature of the proposed translational research is expected to yield new knowledge for both BCI development and clinical AAC use.    Relevance: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily care giving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The RSVP keyboard and proposed language models are innovative technological discoveries that are being applied to clinical augmentative communication tools so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care. The proposed project stresses the translation of basic computer science into clinical care, supporting the proposed NIH Roadmap and public health initiatives.

"Integration of an NLP-based application to support medication management     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An accurate and complete medication list on a patient's electronic health record (EHR) is critical to prevent prescribing and administration errors. Stage 1 of Meaningful Use requires certified EHRs to be capable of providing a user with the ability to perform medication reconciliation. However, most previous studies have taken place in the inpatient setting, while medication reconciliation in the outpatient setting is importnt and challenging. In addition, clinical notes contain critical medication information that also need to be reconciled. Our goal of this study is to develop novel methods and a system using natural language processing (NLP) and other technologies to facilitate the medication reconciliation process in the ambulatory setting. Our specific aims are to : 1) identify the requirements, use cases, work flow issues, barriers to and facilitators of using clinical notes and a NLP-based system in the medication reconciliation process; 2) design a generic system architecture and an application that integrates an NLP system and a web-based user interface within an existing medication reconciliation system; 3) pilot this study in two primary care clinics and measure the utilization, usability, performance and feasibility of the proposed methods and the tool; and 4) distribute our methods and the tool and to make them widely available to other researchers and healthcare institutions for non-commercial use.          An accurate and complete medication list on a patient's electronic health record (EHR) is critical to prevent prescribing and administration errors. In thi study, we will develop novel methods and a tool using natural language processing and other technologies to facilitate the medication reconciliation process.

"Annotation, development and evaluation for clinical information extraction (transfer) Much of the clinical information required for accurate clinical research, active decision support, and broad-coverage surveillance is locked in text files in an electronic medical record (EMR). The only feasible way to leverage this information for translational science is to extract and encode the information using natural language processing (NLP). Over the last two decades, several research groups have developed NLP tools for clinical notes, but a major bottleneck preventing progress in clinical NLP is the lack of standard, annotated data sets for training and evaluating NLP applications. Without these standards, individual NLP applications abound without the ability to train different algorithms on standard annotations, share and integrate NLP modules, or compare performance. We propose to develop standards and infrastructure that can enable technology to extract scientific information from textual medical records, and we propose the research as a collaborative effort involving NLP experts across the U.S. To accomplish this goal, we will address three specific aims: Aim 1: Extend existing standards and develop new consensus standards for annotating clinical text in a way that is interoperable, extensible, and usable. Aim 2: Apply existing methods and tools, and develop new methods and tools where necessary for manually annotating a set of publicly available clinical texts in a way that is efficient and accurate. Aim 3: Develop a publicly available toolkit for automatically annotating clinical text and perform a shared evaluation to evaluate the toolkit, using evaluation metrics that are multidimensional and flexible. In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research. We will experiment with methods for increasing the efficiency of annotation and will annotate de-identified reports of nine types for linguistic and clinical information. In addition, we will create an NLP toolkit that can be shared and will evaluate it against other NLP systems in a shared task evaluation with the community.","Annotation, development and evaluation for clinical information extraction (transfer)",8868500,R01GM090187,[' '],NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2013,297936,0.047580884081445916

"Automated Dynamic Lists for Efficient Electronic Health Record Management     DESCRIPTION (provided by APPLICANT): Medical errors are recognized as the cause of numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many are preventable. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information in the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of the information available in the EHR is only mentioned in narrative clinical documents. Electronic lists of problems and allergies are available in most EHRs, but they require manual management by their users, to add new problems, modify existing ones, and the removal of the ones that are irrelevant. Consequently, these electronic lists are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. Clinacuity, Inc. proposes to develop a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the EHR of patients suffering from cancer. To establish the merit and feasibility of such a system, we will work on the following objectives: 1) create a reference standard for training and testing the information extraction application, a reference standard including a random sample of de-identified clinical narratives from patients treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute Cancer Clinics (Salt Lake City, Utah), with problems and allergies annotated by domain experts; 2) develop a prototype to automatically extract medical problems and allergies, implementing a novel stepwise hybrid approach to maximize sensitivity first, and also enhance positive predictive value; and 3) test the prototype with the aforementioned reference standard, using a cross-validation approach for training and testing. Commercial application: The system Clinacuity proposes will not only help healthcare providers maintain complete and timely lists of problems and allergies, providing them with an efficient overview of a patient, but also help healthcare organizations attain meaningful use requirements. The proposed system has potential commercial applications in inpatient and outpatient settings, increasing the efficiency of busy healthcare providers by saving time, and aiding healthcare organizations in demonstrating ""meaningful use"" and obtaining Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services incentive payments. Clinacuity will further extend the commercial potential of the system and it is output, using modular design principles allowing utilization of each module independently, and enhancing its local adaptability for easier deployment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical errors cause numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many could be prevented.

"Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key prerequisite for high-quality healthcare delivery is effective communication within and across healthcare settings. However, communication can be hampered by the pervasive use of abbreviations in clinical notes. Clinicians use abbreviations to save time during documentation. While abbreviations may seem unambiguous to their authors, they often cause confusion to other readers, including healthcare providers, patients, and natural language processing (NLP) systems attempting to extract clinical terms from text. While the understanding that abbreviations can cause errors is widespread, few have deployed pragmatic solutions for this important problem. The proposed project will develop, evaluate, and share a systematic approach to Clinical Abbreviation Recognition and Disambiguation (CARD), and in doing so substantially aims to benefit existing NLP systems and to improve computer-based documentation systems by reducing ambiguities in electronic records in real-time. The study includes the following five Specific Aims: 1) Develop automated methods to detect abbreviations and their senses from clinical text corpora and build a comprehensive knowledge base of clinical abbreviations; 2) Develop and evaluate three automated word sense disambiguation (WSD) classifiers, and establish methods to combine those classifiers to maximize both their performance and coverage; 3) Develop the CARD system, and demonstrate its effectiveness by integrating it with two established NLP systems (MedLEE and KnowledgeMap); 4) Integrate CARD with an institutional clinical documentation system (Vanderbilt's StarNotes) and evaluate its ability to expand abbreviations in real-time as clinicians generate records; 5) Distribute the CARD knowledge base and software for non-commercial uses.              Project Narrative Abbreviations are widely used throughout all types of clinical documents and they cause confusion to both healthcare providers and patients and limit effective communications within and across care settings. This proposed study will develop informatics methods to automatically detect abbreviations and their possible meanings from large clinical text and to disambiguate abbreviations that have multiple meanings. We will also integrate those methods with clinical documentation systems so that abbreviations will be expanded in real-time when physicians entering clinical notes, thus to improve the quality of health records.",Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes,8305149,R01LM010681,"['Abbreviations', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Confusion', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Frequencies', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nitroglycerin', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Reader', 'Records', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'acronyms', 'base', 'health care delivery', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'phrases', 'satisfaction']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,129035,0.04536975836684075
"Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) contain useful information that is difficult to automatically extract, index, search, or interpret. Clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies for automatic extraction, indexing, searching, and interpretation of EHRs are in development; however, due to privacy concerns related to EHRs, such technologies are usually developed by teams that have privileged access to EHRs in a specific institution. Technologies that are tailored to a specific set of data from a given institution generate inspiring results on that data; however, they can fail to generalize to similar data from other institutions and even other departments from the same institution. Therefore, learning from these technologies and building on them becomes difficult.          In order to improve NLP in EHRs, there is need for head-to-head comparison of approaches that can address a given task on the same data set. Shared-tasks provide one way of conducting systematic head-to- head comparisons. This proposal describes a series of shared-task challenges and conferences, spread over a five year period, that promote the development and evaluation of cutting edge clinical NLP systems by distributing de-identified EHRs to the broad research community, under data use agreements, so that:      *	the state-of-the-art in clinical NLP technologies can be identified and advanced,      *	a set of technologies that enable the use of the information contained in EHR narratives becomes available, and      *	the information from EHR narratives can be made more accessible, for example, for clinical and medical research.          The scientific activities supporting the organization of the shared-task challenges are sponsored in part by Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), grant number U54-LM008748, PI: Kohane.          This proposal aims to organize a series of workshops, conference proceedings, and journal special issues that will accompany the shared-task challenges in order to disseminate the knowledge generated by the challenges.                  Public health relevance: this proposal will address two main challenges related to the use of clinical narratives for research: availability of clinical records for research and identification of the state of the art in clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies so that we can push the state of the art forward and so that future work can build on the past.

"Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance patient safety and reduce the cost of medical care by discovering novel adverse drug events (ADEs) through use of automated methods. We will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and data mining methodologies on vast quantities of clinical data in electronic health records (EHRs) to detect novel ADE signals. ADEs are major problems world-wide and cause hospitalizations, deaths, and incur a huge cost to health care. Therefore, continued post-marketing surveillance encompassing large and varied patient populations is crucial for patient safety. EHRs contain a comprehensive amount of clinical information, which if harnessed properly, would be invaluable for pharmacovigilance. We have already demonstrated that we can accurately encode information in clinical reports using the NLP system MedLEE, and that we can accurately detect associations among clinical events using statistical methods that we developed. Therefore, this is an excellent opportunity to continue our research accomplishments and to advance the state of the art in pharmacovigilance.       More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map comprehensive clinical information in the EHR to codified data, and then statistical methods will be used to generate an extensive knowledge base of disease-symptom, disease-drug, drug-drug, and drug-symptom associations, which will be used to discover new ADEs. Additionally, we will develop methods to determine the correct sequence of drug, disease, and symptom events, which is critical for detecting ADEs. We will also develop methods to map fine-grained concepts into higher level concepts, which is important for optimizing the statistical methods. The performance of our discovery methods will be evaluated by testing the methods using drugs currently in use with known ADEs, and also by using historical rollback. We will first focus on discovery of short-term events using inpatient records, and then longer-term events using outpatient office visits.       This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods based on spontaneous reporting databases and administrative databases. We are confident the methods will be effective because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in this proposal presents an excellent chance to dramatically improve patient safety and reduce costs.               This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by developing effective methods for the discovery of new adverse drug events. The use of natural language processing on vast quantities of EHR records will result in the harnessing of comprehensive clinical information for this purpose, overcoming some of the limitations of current methods that rely on spontaneous reporting and administrative databases.","Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR",8318253,R01LM010016,"['Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Back', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Office Visits', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'administrative database', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'drug testing', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'statistics', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2012,327503,0.0493364498779268

This tension between utility and privacy is especially acute in predictive personalized medicine (PPM). PPM holds the promise of making treatment decisions tailored to the individual based on her or his particular genetics and clinical history. Making PPM a reality requires running statistical, data mining and machine learning algorithms on combined genetic, clinical and demographic data to construct predictive models. Access to such data directly competes with the need for healthcare providers to protect the privacy of each patient's data, thus creating a tradeoff between model efficacy and privacy. Thus we find ourselves in an unfortunate standoff: significant medical advances that would result from more powerful mining of the data by a wider variety of researchers are hindered by significant privacy concerns on behalf of the patients represented in the data set. In this proposed work, we seek to develop and evaluate technology to resolve this standoff, enabling health practitioners and researchers to compute on privacy-sensitive medical records in order to make treatment decisions or create accurate models, while protecting patient privacy. We will evaluate our approach on a de-identified actual electronic medical record, with an average of 29 years of clinical history on each patient, and with detailed genetic data (650K SNPs) available for a subset of 5000 of the patients. This data set is available to us now through the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative, but only on a computer at the Marshfield Clinic. If successful our approach will make possible the sharing of this cutting-edge data set, and others like it that are now in development, including our ability to analyze this data at UW-Madison where we have thousands of processors available in our Condor pool. Our privacy approach integrates secure data access environments, including those appropriate to the use of laptops and cloud computing, with novel anonymization algorithms providing differential privacy guarantees for data and/or published results of data analysis. To this end, our specific aims are as follows:       AIM 1: Develop and deploy a secure local environment that, in combination with secure network functionality, will ensure end-to-end security and privacy for electronic medical records and biomedical datasets shared between clinical institutions and researchers.       AIM 2: Develop and deploy a secure virtual environment to allow large-scale, privacy-preserving data analysis ""in the cloud.""       AIM 3: Develop and evaluate privacy-preserving data mining algorithms for use with original (not anonymized) data sets consisting of electronic medical records and genetic data.       AIM 4: Develop and evaluate anonymizing data publishing algorithms and privacy guarantees that are appropriate to the complex structure present in electronic medical records with genetic data.            Project Narrative This project will develop an integrated approach to secure sharing of clinical and genetic data that based on algorithms for anonymization of data to achieve differential privacy guarantees, for privacy-preserving publication of data analysis results, and secure environments for data sharing that include addressing the increasing use of laptops and of cloud computing. The end goal of this project is to meet the competing demands of providing patients with both privacy and accurate predictive models based on clinical history and genetics. This project includes the first concrete evaluation of privacy- preserving data mining algorithms on actual combined EMR and genetic data, using with the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative data set.",Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers.

"Interactive Search and Review of Clinical Records with Multi-layered Semantic Ann    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A critical element of translating science into practice is the ability to find patient populations for clinical research. Many studies rely on administrative data for selecting relevant patients for studies of comparative effectiveness, but the limitations of administrative data is well-known. Much of the information critical for clinical research is locked in free-text dictated reports, such as history and physical exams and radiology reports. Data repositories, such as the Medical Archival Retrieval System (MARS) at the University of Pittsburgh, are useful for identifying supersets of patients for clinical research studies through indexed word searches. However, simple text-based queries are also limited in their effectiveness, and researchers are often left reading through hundreds or thousands of reports to filter out false positive cases. Current processes are time-consuming and extraordinarily expensive. They lead to long delays between the development of a testable hypothesis and the ability to share findings with the medical community at large.       A potential solution to this problem is pre-annotating de-identified clinical reports to facilitate more intelligent and sophisticated retrieval and review. Clinical reports are rich in meaning and structure and can be annotated at many different levels using natural language processing technology. It is not clear, however, what types of annotations would be most helpful to a clinical researcher, nor is it clear how to display the annotations to best assist manual review of reports. There is interdependence between the annotation schema used by an NLP system and the user interface for assisting researchers in retrieving data for retrospective studies. In this proposal, we will interactively revise an NLP annotation schema as well as explore various methods for annotation display based on feedback from users reviewing patient data for specific research studies.       We hypothesize that an interactive search application that relies on NLP-annotated clinical text will increase the accuracy and efficiency of finding patients for clinical research studies and will support visualization techniques for viewing the data in a way that improves a researcher's ability to review patient data.              Narrative We will develop a novel review application for this proposal that will facilitate translational research from secondary use of EHR data by assisting researchers in more efficiently finding retrospective populations of patients for clinical research studies. The application will rely both on multi-layered annotation of the textual data, using natural langauge processing, and on coordinated views of the patient data.",Interactive Search and Review of Clinical Records with Multi-layered Semantic Ann,8333306,R01LM010964,"['Automated Annotation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Feedback', 'Imagery', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'base', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computer human interaction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'research study', 'success']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2012,592423,0.021814631317176942
"Annotation, development and evaluation for clinical information extraction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much of the clinical information required for accurate clinical research, active decision support, and broad-coverage surveillance is locked in text files in an electronic medical record (EMR). The only feasible way to leverage this information for translational science is to extract and encode the information using natural language processing (NLP). Over the last two decades, several research groups have developed NLP tools for clinical notes, but a major bottleneck preventing progress in clinical NLP is the lack of standard, annotated data sets for training and evaluating NLP applications. Without these standards, individual NLP applications abound without the ability to train different algorithms on standard annotations, share and integrate NLP modules, or compare performance. We propose to develop standards and infrastructure that can enable technology to extract scientific information from textual medical records, and we propose the research as a collaborative effort involving NLP experts across the U.S. To accomplish this goal, we will address three specific aims: Aim 1: Extend existing standards and develop new consensus standards for annotating clinical text in a way that is interoperable, extensible, and usable. Aim 2: Apply existing methods and tools, and develop new methods and tools where necessary for manually annotating a set of publicly available clinical texts in a way that is efficient and accurate. Aim 3: Develop a publicly available toolkit for automatically annotating clinical text and perform a shared evaluation to evaluate the toolkit, using evaluation metrics that are multidimensional and flexible.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research. We will experiment with methods for increasing the efficiency of annotation and will annotate de-identified reports of nine types for linguistic and clinical information. In addition, we will create an NLP toolkit that can be shared and will evaluate it against other NLP systems in a shared task evaluation with the community.

"Contextual ASR to Support EHR Adoption    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems is a national healthcare priority. However studies show massive physician productivity drop of up to 25-40% upon transition to EHR. The majority of workflow delay is based on the need to perform manual operations to fill structured forms within the EHR, as opposed to simple unstructured narratives used in traditional written notes and transcriptions. Vanguard Medical Technologies (VMT), under NIH grant 1R43LM010750, proved feasibility for DocTalk, a real-time, speech-driven, open-source augmented, small practice encounter recording system that processes voice to text to structured medical data to EHR input, utilizing integrated automated speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) in the cloud. While NLP accuracy in Phase I was high, voice accuracy prior to physician review was inadequate. Fortunately, the tight integration of ASR and NLP combined with the formal structure of physician notes offers unique context based approaches to address the challenge. Current speech recognition methods use a single general-purpose medical lexicon to train a recognizer when identifying words. Medical context-specific probabilities are ignored. The four Specific Aims of this Phase I SBIR project are to: 1. Create a textual corpus for each section of a patient encounter note by processing 1 million text based narrative structured encounter notes 2. Build a family of Section-Specific Statistical Language Models (SS-SLMs) specialized in recognizing speech pertaining to each specific section of a patient encounter note, using industry standard open source statistical language modeling tools. 3. Use NLP techniques to infer patterns of language usage from text of each section, a. To detect section boundaries to be used as trigger words for invoking SS-SLMs b. To determine characteristic word distributions of each section 4. Assess improvement in accuracy per section due to use of SS-SLMs, with the goal of 50% overall reduction of errors compared to non-section-specific SLMs in the same medical dictation system.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful completion of this innovative proposed program of NLP-enhanced context based ASR, will provide the accuracy required to deploy an integrated, interactive, intuitive, low-cost data entry system for small practice primary care physicians. The augmented DocTalk system will enable physicians to increase usable information, avoid third-party transcription errors, and mitigate workflow delays. Increased small practice EHR adoption directly addresses national healthcare goals.              Successful completion of this innovative proposed program of NLP-enhanced context based ASR, will provide the accuracy required to deploy an integrated, interactive, intuitive, low-cost data entry system for small practice primary care physicians.

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.           Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2) Project Narrative When completed successfully, the eTfor2 project will enable researchers at disparate institutions to extract from their respective EMR systems a shared ""target"" set of common phenomic descriptors, in a standard, reproducible manner.

"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted.                  Narrative This project is focused on generating a longitudinal health record for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials.

"Applying NLP to Free Text as an EHR Data Capture Method to Improve EHR Usability     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to ensure the ability of ""NLP-Standalone-or-Hybrid Documentation,"" a method of EHR data capture involving Natural Language Processing and possibly also standard EHR data capture, to improve the usability of EHR by reducing documentation time, increasing documentation quality, and increasing clinician satisfaction. Problem to be Addressed. Limited usability of the Electronic Health Record (""EHR"") and lack of standardized terminology impedes EHR adoption and optimal use, and therefore hinders realization of a universally interoperable and evidence-based reportable health care system. Large amounts of time required for documentation, low clinician satisfaction, and incomplete documentation are problems plaguing EHR. Innovation. Current research has demonstrated that NLP may be used for EHR data capture. ZyDoc is furthering the state of research by assessing the capability of NLP-Standalone-or-Hybrid Documentation to improve EHR usability along several criteria. Long Term Goal. By enabling interoperability and improving EHR usability, through improving clinician satisfaction, improving documentation quality, and reducing data capture time, MediSapien will encourage widespread EHR adoption and optimal use with structured data. Phase I Summary. The purpose of the first Specific Aim of this grant proposal is to ensure that NLP- Standalone-or-Hybrid Documentation is capable of improving clinician satisfaction, efficiency, and documentation quality, relative to standard EHR data capture methods. The purpose of the second Specific Aim is to improve the accuracy of MediSapien's coding. These Specific Aims will ensure the technical feasibility of NLP-Standalone-or-Hybrid Documentation and MediSapien for improving EHR usability. Phase II Objectives. In Phase II, ZyDoc will complete product development, beta test MediSapien at two hospitals, and measure the product's impact on clinical outcomes or documentation results. Commercial Opportunity. ZyDoc will offer MediSapien as a modular component by partnering with vendors that combine MediSapien in their own solutions, enabling their clients to meet EHR meaningful use standards.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited usability of the Electronic Health Record (""EHR"") and lack of standardized terminology impedes EHR adoption and meaningful use, and therefore hinders realization of a universally interoperable and evidence- based reportable health care system.

"EHR-based patient safety: Automated error detection in neonatal intensive care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the field of neonatal patient safety, the paucity of systematic research is a critical barrier to progress. Notably missing are studies that meticulously investigate Electronic Health Records (EHR) and information technology in detecting neonatal intensive care-related errors. The expert panel at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHHD) identified multiple gaps in the current knowledge of neonatal patient safety research. The proposed work is a well focused response to three dimensions of the Funding Opportunity Announcement:  1.Develop prospective and retrospective study designs to collect data on patient safety and adverse events.  2.Study the strength and limitations of current methods of error reporting systems.  3.Study the usefulness of commercial IT systems and EHRs in reducing medical errors.  In our study we seek to shift patient safety research toward an automated and computerized approach to achieve a more comprehensive patient safety paradigm. We will develop novel Electronic Health Record (EHR) content-based automated algorithms that are new to patient safety research to 1) detect errors (Aim 1) and 2) categorize subsequent harm (Aim 2). State of the art information extraction and statistical classification techniques from the field of clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) will be adapted to the patient safety research tasks.  In Aim 1 we will fill the gap in the literatre by implementing a focused manual review of 700 charts (one full year of patient admissions at our institution) in one of the largest Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) in the nation. Using a trigger tool, we will identify errors occurring in three specified categories - laboratory test errrs, medication/fluid errors, and airway management errors. We will develop novel algorithms for automated EHR-based detection of the errors and evaluate the performance of the new algorithms against the performance of both trigger tool review by human chart reviewers (current gold standard) and the voluntary incident reporting system (accepted standard). In Aim 2, we will study the utility of novel EHR-based information extraction and statistical algorithms for the automated categorization of errors according to the resulting level of harm.  Our proposed work has the potential to accomplish a paradigm shift in the methods of neonatal patient safety research and practice. The study is a fundamental step to automating patient safety monitoring on a large scale and improving error identification and patient safety in NICUs for millions of children every year.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are developing an automated error detection technique to improve the safety of newborn babies during hospital care.

"POET-2: High-performance computing for advanced clinical narrative preprocessing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This project focuses on clinical natural language processing (cNLP), a field of emerging importance in informatics. Starting with the Linguistic String Project's Medical Language Processor (New York University) in the 1970s, researchers have made steady gains in cNLP through empirical studies and by building sophisticated high-level cNLP software applications (e.g., Columbia's MedLEE). There are no fewer than four scientific conferences devoted exclusively to biomedical/clinical NLP. The cNLP literature has been growing over the past decade, and this will gain momentum as more clinical text repositories are released, such as the MIMIC II and University of Pittsburgh BLU Lab corpora.       However, sustained success in the field of cNLP is hampered by the reality that clinical texts have a far more noise than do texts traditionally studied in NLP, such as newswire articles, biomedical abstracts, and discharge summaries. Noise in this context is defined by the parseability characteristics of the language and the linguistic structures that appear in text. Clinical texts come in a striking variety of note types, with the best studied types being discharge summaries, radiology reports, and pathology reports. These note types share an important feature: they are written to communicate care issues between healthcare providers and hence typically are well-composed, well-edited, and often are dictated. But the vast majority of notes in the electronic health record are written primarily to document care issues. They communicate as well, of course, but much less care is used in their creation than with discharge summaries and reports. As a result they are often ungrammatical; are composed of short, telegraphic phrases; are replete with misspellings and shorthand (e.g., abbreviations); are ill-formatted with templates and liberal use of white space; and are embedded with ""non-prose"" (e.g., strings of laboratory values). All of these sources of noise complicate otherwise straightforward NLP tasks like tokenization, sentence segmentation, and ultimately information extraction itself.       We propose a systematic study of ways to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in clinical narratives to improve cNLP. This work extends our preliminary research (under the POET project) and has the following aims:        o Develop and implement a suite of parseability improvement tools designed for all clinical note types from multiple healthcare institutions.     o Evaluate the empirical and the functional success of the parseability improvement tools.     o Design and implement a HIPAA-compliant UlMA-based pipeline cNLP framework for use in a typical high-performance, multi-processor computing environment.              Project Narrative We can see in the multi-billion dollar investment in electronic health records (EHRs) by the ARRA that mining clinical data electronically will continue to be essential to informatics research. Most data in the EHR resides as unstructured text, and POET2 provides a means to unlock that data through combining a new, HIPAA- complaint high-performance computing architecture with sophisticated text preprocessing.",POET-2: High-performance computing for advanced clinical narrative preprocessing,8326648,R01LM010981,"['Abbreviations', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Authorization documentation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Occupations', 'Outpatients', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Proliferating', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Report (document)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Shorthand', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Summary Reports', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voting', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'data mining', 'design', 'improved', 'meetings', 'novel', 'phrases', 'pressure', 'repaired', 'repository', 'research study', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web services']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2012,318393,0.017207269079588156
"An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records Observational epidemiological studies are effective methods for identifying  factors affecting the health and illness of populations, as well as for determining optimal  treatments for diseases, such as cancers. However, conventional epidemiological  research usually involves personnel-intensive effort (such as manual chart and public  records review) and can be very time consuming before conclusive results are obtained.  Recently, a large amount of detailed longitudinal clinical data has been accumulated at  hospitals' Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and it has become a valuable data  source for epidemiological studies. However, there are two obstacles that prevent the  wide usage of EMR data in epidemiological studies. First, most of the detailed clinical  information in EMRs is embedded in narrative text and it is very costly to extract that  information manually. Second, EMRs usually have data quality problems such as  selection bias and missing data, which require adaptation of conventional statistical  methods developed for randomized controlled trials.   In this study, we propose an in silico informatics-based approach for  observational epidemiological studies using EMR data. We hypothesize that existing  EMR data can be used for certain types of epidemiological studies in a very efficient  manner with the help of informatics methods. The informatics-based approach will  contain two major components. One is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) based  information extraction system that can automatically extract detailed clinical information  from EMR and another is a set of statistical and informatics methods that can be used to  analyze EMR-derived data. If the feasibility of this approach is proven, it will change the  standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research, because it has the  capability to answer an epidemiological question in a very short time at a very low cost.   The specific aim of this study is to develop an automated informatics approach to  extract both fine-grained cancer findings and general clinical information from EMRs and  use them to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies. We will perform both case-  control and cohort studies related to prevention and treatment of breast and colon  cancers using EMR data. The informatics approach will be validated on EMRs from two  major hospitals to demonstrate its generalizability. Epidemiological findings from our  study will be compared to reported findings for validation. Project Narrative  According to the American Cancer Society, about 7.6 million people died from various  types of cancer in the world during 2007. It is very important to identify risk factors of  cancers and to determine optimal treatments of cancers, and epidemiological study is  one of the methods to achieve it. This proposed study will use natural language  processing technologies to automatically extract fine-grained cancer information from  existing patient electronic medical records and use it to conduct cancer related  epidemiological studies, thus accelerating knowledge accumulation of cancer research.",An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records,8298614,R01CA141307,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American Cancer Society', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cereals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethics', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Observational Study', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic procedure', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prognostic indicator', 'public health research', 'statistics', 'treatment effect']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,56569,-0.007433026483170266
"Increasing Clinical Trial Enrollment: A Semi-Automated Patient Centered Approach  Abstract The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application. The study design is prospective observational study. Scope is limited to cancer patients. There are three specific aims for this project. The first aim is to identify concepts that overlap between the electronic medical record's (EMR) clinical notes and the free text of clinical trial announcements. The PI will use the concepts to develop mapping frames that connect concepts in the text of trial announcements to those found in clinical notes in the medical record. When he has the mapping frames he will build the NLP module for the application. In the software development work he will utilize as many publicly available software components as possible. He will experiment with UIMA, GATE, MetaMap, Stanford Parser, NegEx algorithm and others. The PI will develop the tool around the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System knowledgebase. He will use Java for programming. The second aim is to create an algorithm that automatically generates questions to request information directly from the patient if the information is not available or accessible in the records. The third aim is to evaluate the in-vitro, laboratory performance of the application. For performance evaluation purposes the PI will recruit cancer care specialists to generate the gold standard lists of eligible clinical trials for study patients. He will publicly release the developed code at the end of the grant period. This K99/R00 project will serve the foundation for future R01 grant applications. The PI is fully committed to become faculty in the Clinical Research Informatics domain with a specialization in biomedical NLP. The support of the K99/R00 grant will enable him to acquire substantial formal training in Computational Linguistics while contributing to the body of knowledge of the Clinical Research Informatics field. The five-year grant support will ensure success in his endeavor. The proposed work is highly significant because the dismal clinical trial accrual rates (2-4 % nationally) hampers timely development of new drugs. In addition, studies show that physicians have statistically significant bias against elderly and minority patients to invite participation in clinical trials. The proposed project is synergistic with physician-centered efforts but the goal is to provide individualized, EMR based clinical trial recommendations directly to the patients. The results of this research will empower the patients and elevate their role in the decision making process.

"Genetic Discovery and  Application in a Clinical Setting Continuing a Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle eMERGE project aims to bring personal genomics to practice settings by taking advantage of the extensive electronic medical record (EMR) and biorepository of Group Health Cooperative (GH), including a 33-year pharmacy database and longitudinal data on an aging population. Algorithms developed in eMERGE I will be used to combine genome-wide association studies with phenotypes mined from EMRs to discover new polymorphism-phenotype relationships. Target phenotypes are infectious disease susceptibility, specifically to Clostridium difficile diarrhea, shingles from varicella zoster virus, and fungal nail infection, responses to antihypertensive drugs, serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, and statins, including adverse events. A new algorithm will follow longitudinal glycemia and hematocrit trajectories, and a novel automated method will detect karyotype abnormalities for assessing correlation to myelodysplasia and leukemia. Data will also support phenotypes investigated at other eMERGE sites. To create a model for introducing genomics into clinical practice, successful needs assessment methods from eMERGE I will engage stakeholders in guiding development of prototype EMR user interfaces in a clinical decision support format. The test case will be human leukocyte antigen-typing for an adverse drug reaction and the setting will be the patient-centered medical home care model developed at GH. This proposal provides the eMERGE network and its collaborators with the Seattle team's unique expertise in using natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from EMRs, and assisting in adoption of NLP methods. To disseminate eMERGE results and foster collaborations, it takes advantage of leadership positions of the investigators, including partners within eMERGE, other consortia and the HMO Research network, especially the potential for developments supported by the NIH Director's Common Fund in biobanking and megaepidemiology. Completion of the aims will reveal new, medically useful markers, improve the linking of high-throughput genomic methods to EMR data, and develop policies and practices for bringing individualized evidence-based medicine to communities.       RELEVANCE (See instrucfions): To advance personalized medicine-treatment and preventive care based on individual traits; this project matches small differences in DNA to infectious disease susceptibility and response to statins, serotonin- specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and blood pressure medications.

"Integration of an NLP-based application to support medication management     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An accurate and complete medication list on a patient's electronic health record (EHR) is critical to prevent prescribing and administration errors. Stage 1 of Meaningful Use requires certified EHRs to be capable of providing a user with the ability to perform medication reconciliation. However, most previous studies have taken place in the inpatient setting, while medication reconciliation in the outpatient setting is importnt and challenging. In addition, clinical notes contain critical medication information that also need to be reconciled. Our goal of this study is to develop novel methods and a system using natural language processing (NLP) and other technologies to facilitate the medication reconciliation process in the ambulatory setting. Our specific aims are to : 1) identify the requirements, use cases, work flow issues, barriers to and facilitators of using clinical notes and a NLP-based system in the medication reconciliation process; 2) design a generic system architecture and an application that integrates an NLP system and a web-based user interface within an existing medication reconciliation system; 3) pilot this study in two primary care clinics and measure the utilization, usability, performance and feasibility of the proposed methods and the tool; and 4) distribute our methods and the tool and to make them widely available to other researchers and healthcare institutions for non-commercial use.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An accurate and complete medication list on a patient's electronic health record (EHR) is critical to prevent prescribing and administration errors.

"Translational refinement of adaptive communication system for locked-in patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proliferation of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology promises locked-in patients potential ways to communicate successfully. Most BCI systems either involve selection from among a set of simultaneously presented stimuli, requiring extensive control of the interface; or use binary stimulus selection mechanisms that fail to achieve high communication rates because of slow intent detection or a fixed (context independent) ordering of stimuli. We propose a new interface using binary selection of text input via rapid serial visual presentation of natural language components. Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from acquired neurological disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) and neurodevelopmental disorders (cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy) drive the proposed research. Four laboratories form an alliance for this translational research project: basic research (Erdogmus, engineering; Roark, computer science and natural language processing), and clinical research (Oken, neurology/neurophysiology; Fried-Oken, augmentative communication/neurogenic communication disorders). Our aims are (1) to develop an innovative EEG-based BCI that achieves increased communication rates with fewer errors and greater satisfaction for the target SSPI populations; (2) to iteratively refine the system in the laboratory with user feedback from healthy subjects and expert LIS users of marketed AAC systems; (3) to evaluate the performance of the system within the natural clinical settings of SSPI patients. The innovative BCI is the RSVP Keyboard with three essential features: (1) rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of linguistic components ranging from letters to words to phrases; (2) a detection mechanism that employs multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and/or other suitable response mechanisms that can reliably indicate the binary intent of the user and adapt based on individualized neurophysiologic data of the user; and (3) an open-vocabulary natural language model with a capability for accurate predictions of upcoming text. Theoretical framework is based on a solid Bayesian foundation; clinical usability is based on the WHO ICF (WHO, 2001) and an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) model of participation. Rigorous experimental scrutiny in both clinical laboratory and natural settings will be obtained with able-bodied subjects and SSPI patients. Measures of learning rate, speed of message production, error rate and user satisfaction for different iterations of the RSVP keyboard will be obtained using an hypothesis-driven crossover design for 36 healthy subjects, and alternating treatment randomization design for 40 patients with SSPI. Descriptions of the motor, cognitive, and language skills of LIS patients using the novel system in their natural environments will inform clinical guidelines and functional device adaptations to better individualize treatment for children and adults with SSPI. The collaborative nature of the proposed translational research is expected to yield new knowledge for both BCI development and clinical AAC use.    Relevance: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life.

"Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key prerequisite for high-quality healthcare delivery is effective communication within and across healthcare settings. However, communication can be hampered by the pervasive use of abbreviations in clinical notes. Clinicians use abbreviations to save time during documentation. While abbreviations may seem unambiguous to their authors, they often cause confusion to other readers, including healthcare providers, patients, and natural language processing (NLP) systems attempting to extract clinical terms from text. While the understanding that abbreviations can cause errors is widespread, few have deployed pragmatic solutions for this important problem. The proposed project will develop, evaluate, and share a systematic approach to Clinical Abbreviation Recognition and Disambiguation (CARD), and in doing so substantially aims to benefit existing NLP systems and to improve computer-based documentation systems by reducing ambiguities in electronic records in real-time. The study includes the following five Specific Aims: 1) Develop automated methods to detect abbreviations and their senses from clinical text corpora and build a comprehensive knowledge base of clinical abbreviations; 2) Develop and evaluate three automated word sense disambiguation (WSD) classifiers, and establish methods to combine those classifiers to maximize both their performance and coverage; 3) Develop the CARD system, and demonstrate its effectiveness by integrating it with two established NLP systems (MedLEE and KnowledgeMap); 4) Integrate CARD with an institutional clinical documentation system (Vanderbilt's StarNotes) and evaluate its ability to expand abbreviations in real-time as clinicians generate records; 5) Distribute the CARD knowledge base and software for non-commercial uses.              Project Narrative Abbreviations are widely used throughout all types of clinical documents and they cause confusion to both healthcare providers and patients and limit effective communications within and across care settings. This proposed study will develop informatics methods to automatically detect abbreviations and their possible meanings from large clinical text and to disambiguate abbreviations that have multiple meanings.

However, conventional epidemiological  research usually involves personnel-intensive effort (such as manual chart and public  records review) and can be very time consuming before conclusive results are obtained.  Recently, a large amount of detailed longitudinal clinical data has been accumulated at  hospitals' Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and it has become a valuable data  source for epidemiological studies. However, there are two obstacles that prevent the  wide usage of EMR data in epidemiological studies. First, most of the detailed clinical  information in EMRs is embedded in narrative text and it is very costly to extract that  information manually. Second, EMRs usually have data quality problems such as  selection bias and missing data, which require adaptation of conventional statistical  methods developed for randomized controlled trials.   In this study, we propose an in silico informatics-based approach for  observational epidemiological studies using EMR data. We hypothesize that existing  EMR data can be used for certain types of epidemiological studies in a very efficient  manner with the help of informatics methods. The informatics-based approach will  contain two major components. One is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) based  information extraction system that can automatically extract detailed clinical information  from EMR and another is a set of statistical and informatics methods that can be used to  analyze EMR-derived data. If the feasibility of this approach is proven, it will change the  standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research, because it has the  capability to answer an epidemiological question in a very short time at a very low cost.   The specific aim of this study is to develop an automated informatics approach to  extract both fine-grained cancer findings and general clinical information from EMRs and  use them to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies. We will perform both case-  control and cohort studies related to prevention and treatment of breast and colon  cancers using EMR data. The informatics approach will be validated on EMRs from two  major hospitals to demonstrate its generalizability. Epidemiological findings from our  study will be compared to reported findings for validation. Project Narrative  According to the American Cancer Society, about 7.6 million people died from various  types of cancer in the world during 2007. It is very important to identify risk factors of  cancers and to determine optimal treatments of cancers, and epidemiological study is  one of the methods to achieve it. This proposed study will use natural language  processing technologies to automatically extract fine-grained cancer information from  existing patient electronic medical records and use it to conduct cancer related  epidemiological studies, thus accelerating knowledge accumulation of cancer research.",An insilico method for epidemiological studies using Electonic Medical Records,8589201,R01CA141307,[' '],NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2012,195838,-0.011090345228962973
"Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        	Epidemiologic analyses of health care data can provide critical evidence on the effectiveness and safety of therapeutics. This is particularly vital during the transition from the point of regulatory approval through the early marketing of new drugs, a time when physicians, regulators and payers are all struggling with incomplete data. Health plans pay for these drugs without knowing how their effectiveness and safety compares with established alternatives, as new compounds are tested against placebos rather than active agents, and tested only in selected patients. Non-randomized studies in large healthcare databases can provide fast and less costly evidence on drug effects. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a small number of investigator-specified confounders often fail and may produce biased results.     We propose and have preliminary evidence that employing modern medical informatics algorithms that structure and search databases to empirically identify thousands of new covariates. These will then enter established propensity score-based models and so make far more effective use of the information contained in health care databases and electronic medical records (EMRs), resulting in more valid causal interpretations of treatment effects. We will:    - Develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims and EMR databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. The performance of these approaches will be evaluated in 6 example studies encompassing recent drug safety and comparative effectiveness problems, and will be implemented in multiple large claims databases supplemented by such data as lab values and EMR information in subgroups.    -- Develop novel methods for confounding adjustment based on textual information found in EMRs.    -- Expand the newly developed mining algorithms into a framework that integrates distributed database networks with uneven information content, similar to the Sentinel Network recently initiated by FDA.                            This project is likely to produce groundbreaking results at the interface of medicine, biomedical informatics, and epidemiologic methods. After completion of this project a library of documented and validated algorithms will be available to significantly improve confounder control in a range of healthcare databases. The theoretical foundation and the ready-to-use algorithms will likely lead to a fundamental shift in how databases contribute to the fast and accurate assessment of newly-marketed medications.            Large healthcare databases are used to assess the safety and effectiveness of drugs. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a limited number of investigator-specific covariates often fail to produce unbiased results. We will develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims data and electronic medical records databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. This will result in improved causal inference on the comparative safety and effectiveness of newly marketed medications that is both less susceptible to investigator omissions and faster than conventional approaches.",Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects,8318797,R01LM010213,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Distributed Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly woman', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Head', 'Health Planning', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Marketing', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Scoring Method', 'Sentinel', 'Severity of illness', 'Solid', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'data mining', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lectures', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'routine care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2012,383445,-0.008267808452077823
"Near Miss Narratives from the Fire Service: A Bayesian Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will analyze the narrative text fields in all National Fire Fighter Near-Miss Reporting System (NFFNMRS) reports submitted since the system was created in 2005 (3,695 reports as of September 30, 2009). Near miss reporting systems have made major contributions to safety in such industries as aviation, nuclear power, petrochemical processing, steel production, and military operations, because the same patterns of causes of failure and their relations precede both adverse events and near misses. However, firefighters and researchers lack a scientific system to fully analyze the near miss data collected each year. This innovative effort will advance knowledge in firefighter safety by applying novel Bayesian methods of analysis to the narrative text fields of a new data source that has not yet been rigorously investigated. The proposal has 3 aims:  I. to use recently developed auto coding methods to characterize firefighter near miss narratives and classify these narratives into mechanisms of risk/injury. This analysis will apply the International Classification of External Cause of Injuries (ICECI) using Bayesian machine learning techniques to identify the various mechanisms captured in the near miss narratives and their relative prevalence.  II. To identify the correlation between each mechanism of risk/injury and each of the ""Contributing Factors"" listed on the NFFNMRS reporting form. The results will reveal any patterns and trends in the distribution of the contributing factors among the mechanisms, creating a deeper understanding of near miss circumstances, as well as a basis for improving the quality of future near miss data collection.  III. To use manual coding to identify actual injury incidents contained within a random sample of 1,000 near miss narratives and correlate these injuries with the ""Loss Potential"" categories on the NFFNMRS reporting form. The results will demonstrate how actual injuries are distributed within the reporting form's ""Loss Potential"" categories. This proposed study of the near miss narrative text in combination with coded data has the potential to reveal new insights that can strengthen firefighter safety through primary prevention. This study addresses a major gap in firefighter safety knowledge, i.e. the insufficient understanding of near miss events, and will have a high impact on efforts to improve the occupational health and safety of firefighters.

"USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF COPING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of action is key to improving psychosocial interventions for cancer and other chronic disease conditions. In cancer, emotional expression has been identified as one possible mediator of the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient-reported outcomes. However, scientific evaluations of psychological mechanisms of adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases are constrained by limitations associated with self-report measures. Because self-care resources, peer-to-peer networks, and more recent forms of psychosocial intervention are increasingly being delivered online, linguistic and behavioral data can be used to characterize internal coping processes, social interactions, and other manifest behaviors. Few tools are currently available for harnessing text as a potential data source, and signal detection indices of existing tools leave room for considerable improvement in these methodologies (Bantum & Owen, 2009). In the present study, natural language processing and other tools of computational linguistics will be used to develop a machine-learning classifier to identify emotional expression in electronic text data. The aims of the study are: 1) to annotate a large text corpus from cancer survivors using an objective and reliable emotion-coding procedure, 2) to incorporate linguistic and psychological features into a machine-learning classification method and identify which of these features are most strongly associated with codes assigned by trained human raters, and 3) to develop combined psychological and natural language processing (NLP) methods for identifying linguistic markers of emotional coping behaviors. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive corpus of emotionally-laden cancer communications will be developed from 5 existing linguistic datasets. Five raters will be selected and undergo a rigorous training procedure for coding emotional expression using an emotion-coding system previously developed by the research. Coding will take place using an Internet-based coding interface that will allow the investigators to continuously monitor inter-rater reliability. Simultaneous with the coding process, the investigators will link the electronic text data with key linguistic and psychological features, including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), WordNet, part of speech tags, patterns of capitalization and punctuation, emoticons, and textual context. A machine-learning classifier, using tools of natural language processing, will then be applied to the text/feature data and validated against human-rated emotion codes. The long-term objective of this research is to advance a methodology for objectively identifying coping behavior, particularly emotional expression, in order to supplement self-report measures and improve scientific understanding of adjustment to chronic disease, trauma, or other psychological conditions. This work is essential for identifying mechanisms of action in psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors and others and has significance for the fields of medicine, psychology, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being. To date, the study of these factors as mechanisms of action has been limited to self-report measures that may not correlate well with other more objective indicators. The proposed study will improve our ability to identify mechanisms of action by supplementing self-report measures with objectively identified markers of coping behaviors such as emotional expression in natural language used by individuals living with cancer.           Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being.

"Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key prerequisite for high-quality healthcare delivery is effective communication within and across healthcare settings. However, communication can be hampered by the pervasive use of abbreviations in clinical notes. Clinicians use abbreviations to save time during documentation. While abbreviations may seem unambiguous to their authors, they often cause confusion to other readers, including healthcare providers, patients, and natural language processing (NLP) systems attempting to extract clinical terms from text. While the understanding that abbreviations can cause errors is widespread, few have deployed pragmatic solutions for this important problem. The proposed project will develop, evaluate, and share a systematic approach to Clinical Abbreviation Recognition and Disambiguation (CARD), and in doing so substantially aims to benefit existing NLP systems and to improve computer-based documentation systems by reducing ambiguities in electronic records in real-time. The study includes the following five Specific Aims: 1) Develop automated methods to detect abbreviations and their senses from clinical text corpora and build a comprehensive knowledge base of clinical abbreviations; 2) Develop and evaluate three automated word sense disambiguation (WSD) classifiers, and establish methods to combine those classifiers to maximize both their performance and coverage; 3) Develop the CARD system, and demonstrate its effectiveness by integrating it with two established NLP systems (MedLEE and KnowledgeMap); 4) Integrate CARD with an institutional clinical documentation system (Vanderbilt's StarNotes) and evaluate its ability to expand abbreviations in real-time as clinicians generate records; 5) Distribute the CARD knowledge base and software for non-commercial uses.              Project Narrative Abbreviations are widely used throughout all types of clinical documents and they cause confusion to both healthcare providers and patients and limit effective communications within and across care settings. This proposed study will develop informatics methods to automatically detect abbreviations and their possible meanings from large clinical text and to disambiguate abbreviations that have multiple meanings. We will also integrate those methods with clinical documentation systems so that abbreviations will be expanded in real-time when physicians entering clinical notes, thus to improve the quality of health records.",Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes,8077875,R01LM010681,"['Abbreviations', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Confusion', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Frequencies', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nitroglycerin', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Reader', 'Records', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'acronyms', 'base', 'health care delivery', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'phrases', 'satisfaction']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,374000,0.04536975836684075
"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats.

"Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance patient safety and reduce the cost of medical care by discovering novel adverse drug events (ADEs) through use of automated methods. We will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and data mining methodologies on vast quantities of clinical data in electronic health records (EHRs) to detect novel ADE signals. ADEs are major problems world-wide and cause hospitalizations, deaths, and incur a huge cost to health care. Therefore, continued post-marketing surveillance encompassing large and varied patient populations is crucial for patient safety. EHRs contain a comprehensive amount of clinical information, which if harnessed properly, would be invaluable for pharmacovigilance. We have already demonstrated that we can accurately encode information in clinical reports using the NLP system MedLEE, and that we can accurately detect associations among clinical events using statistical methods that we developed. Therefore, this is an excellent opportunity to continue our research accomplishments and to advance the state of the art in pharmacovigilance.       More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map comprehensive clinical information in the EHR to codified data, and then statistical methods will be used to generate an extensive knowledge base of disease-symptom, disease-drug, drug-drug, and drug-symptom associations, which will be used to discover new ADEs. Additionally, we will develop methods to determine the correct sequence of drug, disease, and symptom events, which is critical for detecting ADEs. We will also develop methods to map fine-grained concepts into higher level concepts, which is important for optimizing the statistical methods. The performance of our discovery methods will be evaluated by testing the methods using drugs currently in use with known ADEs, and also by using historical rollback. We will first focus on discovery of short-term events using inpatient records, and then longer-term events using outpatient office visits.       This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods based on spontaneous reporting databases and administrative databases. We are confident the methods will be effective because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in this proposal presents an excellent chance to dramatically improve patient safety and reduce costs.               This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by developing effective methods for the discovery of new adverse drug events. The use of natural language processing on vast quantities of EHR records will result in the harnessing of comprehensive clinical information for this purpose, overcoming some of the limitations of current methods that rely on spontaneous reporting and administrative databases.","Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR",8105502,R01LM010016,"['Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Back', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Office Visits', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'administrative database', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'drug testing', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'statistics', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2011,333575,0.0493364498779268
"Using medical records repositories to improve the alert system design    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Rapid and accurate alerting of concerning patient events and conditions remains an important problem in clinical practice. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into the monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming and costly to extract and codify such knowledge; hence such systems are typically built to cover only very specific conditions. In addition, it is difficult for an expert to foresee the performance of the deployed systems and their potential drawbacks, especially their false alarm rates. It is not uncommon that computer alerting systems are discarded or must undergo multiple costly modification cycles before they reach clinically acceptable levels of performance.    Electronic health record (EHR) repositories today provide an opportunity to test various theories and develop new computational solutions to various clinical problems. The objective of this project is to investigate methods for using the data in such repositories to assist in the development of alerting systems. The project goals include the building of an evidence-driven framework for the evaluation and optimization of alerting systems with the help of past data. The framework will be able to provide early feedback and future performance estimates of an alerting system before it is deployed, which is anticipated to decrease the expert effort required to design such a system and lead to a shorter alerting system design cycle. The evidence-driven framework will be tested and evaluated on multiple clinical conditions and compared to the performance of alerting rules currently deployed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). The project investigators consist of a multidisciplinary team with expertise in rule-based alerting in the hospital setting, clinical pharmacy, laboratory medicine, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, and knowledge based systems.           Project Narrative: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors by sending computer-based reminders and alerts to clinicians.

"Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers. Me    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Computer-assisted medicine is at a crossroads: medical care requires accurate data, but making such data widely available can create unacceptable risks to the privacy of individual patients. This tension between utility and privacy is especially acute in predictive personalized medicine (PPM). PPM holds the promise of making treatment decisions tailored to the individual based on her or his particular genetics and clinical history. Making PPM a reality requires running statistical, data mining and machine learning algorithms on combined genetic, clinical and demographic data to construct predictive models. Access to such data directly competes with the need for healthcare providers to protect the privacy of each patient's data, thus creating a tradeoff between model efficacy and privacy. Thus we find ourselves in an unfortunate standoff: significant medical advances that would result from more powerful mining of the data by a wider variety of researchers are hindered by significant privacy concerns on behalf of the patients represented in the data set. In this proposed work, we seek to develop and evaluate technology to resolve this standoff, enabling health practitioners and researchers to compute on privacy-sensitive medical records in order to make treatment decisions or create accurate models, while protecting patient privacy. We will evaluate our approach on a de-identified actual electronic medical record, with an average of 29 years of clinical history on each patient, and with detailed genetic data (650K SNPs) available for a subset of 5000 of the patients. This data set is available to us now through the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative, but only on a computer at the Marshfield Clinic. If successful our approach will make possible the sharing of this cutting-edge data set, and others like it that are now in development, including our ability to analyze this data at UW-Madison where we have thousands of processors available in our Condor pool.

"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening. The ultimate goal is to accelerate scientific discovery of more effective treatments for illness.",Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data,8055880,R01LM009886,"['Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Drug Formulations', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'eligible participant', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'novel', 'repository', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2011,328942,0.00795350699336474
"Annotation, development and evaluation for clinical information extraction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much of the clinical information required for accurate clinical research, active decision support, and broad-coverage surveillance is locked in text files in an electronic medical record (EMR). The only feasible way to leverage this information for translational science is to extract and encode the information using natural language processing (NLP). Over the last two decades, several research groups have developed NLP tools for clinical notes, but a major bottleneck preventing progress in clinical NLP is the lack of standard, annotated data sets for training and evaluating NLP applications. Without these standards, individual NLP applications abound without the ability to train different algorithms on standard annotations, share and integrate NLP modules, or compare performance. We propose to develop standards and infrastructure that can enable technology to extract scientific information from textual medical records, and we propose the research as a collaborative effort involving NLP experts across the U.S. To accomplish this goal, we will address three specific aims: Aim 1: Extend existing standards and develop new consensus standards for annotating clinical text in a way that is interoperable, extensible, and usable. Aim 2: Apply existing methods and tools, and develop new methods and tools where necessary for manually annotating a set of publicly available clinical texts in a way that is efficient and accurate. Aim 3: Develop a publicly available toolkit for automatically annotating clinical text and perform a shared evaluation to evaluate the toolkit, using evaluation metrics that are multidimensional and flexible.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research. We will experiment with methods for increasing the efficiency of annotation and will annotate de-identified reports of nine types for linguistic and clinical information. In addition, we will create an NLP toolkit that can be shared and will evaluate it against other NLP systems in a shared task evaluation with the community.           Project narrative: In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research.

"Interactive Search and Review of Clinical Records with Multi-layered Semantic Ann    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A critical element of translating science into practice is the ability to find patient populations for clinical research. Many studies rely on administrative data for selecting relevant patients for studies of comparative effectiveness, but the limitations of administrative data is well-known. Much of the information critical for clinical research is locked in free-text dictated reports, such as history and physical exams and radiology reports. Data repositories, such as the Medical Archival Retrieval System (MARS) at the University of Pittsburgh, are useful for identifying supersets of patients for clinical research studies through indexed word searches. However, simple text-based queries are also limited in their effectiveness, and researchers are often left reading through hundreds or thousands of reports to filter out false positive cases. Current processes are time-consuming and extraordinarily expensive. They lead to long delays between the development of a testable hypothesis and the ability to share findings with the medical community at large.       A potential solution to this problem is pre-annotating de-identified clinical reports to facilitate more intelligent and sophisticated retrieval and review. Clinical reports are rich in meaning and structure and can be annotated at many different levels using natural language processing technology. It is not clear, however, what types of annotations would be most helpful to a clinical researcher, nor is it clear how to display the annotations to best assist manual review of reports. There is interdependence between the annotation schema used by an NLP system and the user interface for assisting researchers in retrieving data for retrospective studies. In this proposal, we will interactively revise an NLP annotation schema as well as explore various methods for annotation display based on feedback from users reviewing patient data for specific research studies.       We hypothesize that an interactive search application that relies on NLP-annotated clinical text will increase the accuracy and efficiency of finding patients for clinical research studies and will support visualization techniques for viewing the data in a way that improves a researcher's ability to review patient data.              Narrative We will develop a novel review application for this proposal that will facilitate translational research from secondary use of EHR data by assisting researchers in more efficiently finding retrospective populations of patients for clinical research studies. The application will rely both on multi-layered annotation of the textual data, using natural langauge processing, and on coordinated views of the patient data.",Interactive Search and Review of Clinical Records with Multi-layered Semantic Ann,8022026,R01LM010964,"['Automated Annotation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Feedback', 'Imagery', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'base', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computer human interaction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'research study', 'success']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2011,591195,0.021814631317176942
"An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records DESCRIPTION: Observational epidemiological studies are effective methods for identifying factors affecting the health and illness of populations, as well as for determining optimal treatments for diseases, such as cancers. However, conventional epidemiological research usually involves personnel-intensive effort (such as manual chart and public records review) and can be very time consuming before conclusive results are obtained. Recently, a large amount of detailed longitudinal clinical data has been accumulated at hospitals' Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and it has become a valuable data source for epidemiological studies. However, there are two obstacles that prevent the wide usage of EMR data in epidemiological studies. First, most of the detailed clinical information in EMRs is embedded in narrative text and it is very costly to extract that information manually. Second, EMRs usually have data quality problems such as selection bias and missing data, which require adaptation of conventional statistical methods developed for randomized controlled trials.   In this study, we propose an in silico informatics-based approach for observational epidemiological studies using EMR data. We hypothesize that existing EMR data can be used for certain types of epidemiological studies in a very efficient manner with the help of informatics methods. The informatics-based approach will contain two major components. One is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) based information extraction system that can automatically extract detailed clinical information from EMR and another is a set of statistical and informatics methods that can be used to analyze EMR-derived data. If the feasibility of this approach is proven, it will change the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research, because it has the capability to answer an epidemiological question in a very short time at a very low cost. The specific aim of this study is to develop an automated informatics approach to extract both fine-grained cancer findings and general clinical information from EMRs and use them to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies. We will perform both casecontrol and cohort studies related to prevention and treatment of breast and colon cancers using EMR data. The informatics approach will be validated on EMRs from two major hospitals to demonstrate its generalizability. Epidemiological findings from our study will be compared to reported findings for validation.  Project Narrative According to the American Cancer Society, about 7.6 million people died from various types of cancer in the world during 2007. It is very important to identify risk factors of cancers and to determine optimal treatments of cancers, and epidemiological study is one of the methods to achieve it. This proposed study will use natural language processing technologies to automatically extract fine-grained cancer information from existing patient electronic medical records and use it to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies, thus accelerating knowledge accumulation of cancer research.",An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records,8110041,R01CA141307,"['Affect', 'American Cancer Society', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cereals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection Bias', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cost', 'prevent']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,252298,-0.007204886106538769
"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.           Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2) Project Narrative When completed successfully, the eTfor2 project will enable researchers at disparate institutions to extract from their respective EMR systems a shared ""target"" set of common phenomic descriptors, in a standard, reproducible manner.

"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors. We subscribe to a vision of Personalized Medicine in which genomic and other patient-specific information drives personalized, predictive, preemptive, and participatory health care, and VGER represents an important step in that direction.           n/a",Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project,8306467,U01HG004603,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Ethics', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Ethics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'endophenotype', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rhythm', 'indexing', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'repository', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2011,13000,0.03980435374933291
"POET-2: High-performance computing for advanced clinical narrative preprocessing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This project focuses on clinical natural language processing (cNLP), a field of emerging importance in informatics. Starting with the Linguistic String Project's Medical Language Processor (New York University) in the 1970s, researchers have made steady gains in cNLP through empirical studies and by building sophisticated high-level cNLP software applications (e.g., Columbia's MedLEE). There are no fewer than four scientific conferences devoted exclusively to biomedical/clinical NLP. The cNLP literature has been growing over the past decade, and this will gain momentum as more clinical text repositories are released, such as the MIMIC II and University of Pittsburgh BLU Lab corpora.       However, sustained success in the field of cNLP is hampered by the reality that clinical texts have a far more noise than do texts traditionally studied in NLP, such as newswire articles, biomedical abstracts, and discharge summaries. Noise in this context is defined by the parseability characteristics of the language and the linguistic structures that appear in text. Clinical texts come in a striking variety of note types, with the best studied types being discharge summaries, radiology reports, and pathology reports. These note types share an important feature: they are written to communicate care issues between healthcare providers and hence typically are well-composed, well-edited, and often are dictated. But the vast majority of notes in the electronic health record are written primarily to document care issues. They communicate as well, of course, but much less care is used in their creation than with discharge summaries and reports. As a result they are often ungrammatical; are composed of short, telegraphic phrases; are replete with misspellings and shorthand (e.g., abbreviations); are ill-formatted with templates and liberal use of white space; and are embedded with ""non-prose"" (e.g., strings of laboratory values). All of these sources of noise complicate otherwise straightforward NLP tasks like tokenization, sentence segmentation, and ultimately information extraction itself.       We propose a systematic study of ways to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in clinical narratives to improve cNLP. This work extends our preliminary research (under the POET project) and has the following aims:        o Develop and implement a suite of parseability improvement tools designed for all clinical note types from multiple healthcare institutions.     o Evaluate the empirical and the functional success of the parseability improvement tools.     o Design and implement a HIPAA-compliant UlMA-based pipeline cNLP framework for use in a typical high-performance, multi-processor computing environment.              Project Narrative We can see in the multi-billion dollar investment in electronic health records (EHRs) by the ARRA that mining clinical data electronically will continue to be essential to informatics research. Most data in the EHR resides as unstructured text, and POET2 provides a means to unlock that data through combining a new, HIPAA- complaint high-performance computing architecture with sophisticated text preprocessing.",POET-2: High-performance computing for advanced clinical narrative preprocessing,8182025,R01LM010981,"['Abbreviations', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Authorization documentation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Occupations', 'Outpatients', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Proliferating', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Report (document)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Shorthand', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Summary Reports', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voting', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'data mining', 'design', 'improved', 'meetings', 'novel', 'phrases', 'pressure', 'repaired', 'repository', 'research study', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web services']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2011,325163,0.017207269079588156
"Genetic Discovery and  Application in a Clinical Setting Continuing a Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle eMERGE project aims to bring personal genomics to practice settings by taking advantage of the extensive electronic medical record (EMR) and biorepository of Group Health Cooperative (GH), including a 33-year pharmacy database and longitudinal data on an aging population. Algorithms developed in eMERGE I will be used to combine genome-wide association studies with phenotypes mined from EMRs to discover new polymorphism-phenotype relationships. Target phenotypes are infectious disease susceptibility, specifically to Clostridium difficile diarrhea, shingles from varicella zoster virus, and fungal nail infection, responses to antihypertensive drugs, serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, and statins, including adverse events. A new algorithm will follow longitudinal glycemia and hematocrit trajectories, and a novel automated method will detect karyotype abnormalities for assessing correlation to myelodysplasia and leukemia. Data will also support phenotypes investigated at other eMERGE sites. To create a model for introducing genomics into clinical practice, successful needs assessment methods from eMERGE I will engage stakeholders in guiding development of prototype EMR user interfaces in a clinical decision support format. The test case will be human leukocyte antigen-typing for an adverse drug reaction and the setting will be the patient-centered medical home care model developed at GH. This proposal provides the eMERGE network and its collaborators with the Seattle team's unique expertise in using natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from EMRs, and assisting in adoption of NLP methods.

"Translational refinement of adaptive communication system for locked-in patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proliferation of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology promises locked-in patients potential ways to communicate successfully. Most BCI systems either involve selection from among a set of simultaneously presented stimuli, requiring extensive control of the interface; or use binary stimulus selection mechanisms that fail to achieve high communication rates because of slow intent detection or a fixed (context independent) ordering of stimuli. We propose a new interface using binary selection of text input via rapid serial visual presentation of natural language components. Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from acquired neurological disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) and neurodevelopmental disorders (cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy) drive the proposed research. Four laboratories form an alliance for this translational research project: basic research (Erdogmus, engineering; Roark, computer science and natural language processing), and clinical research (Oken, neurology/neurophysiology; Fried-Oken, augmentative communication/neurogenic communication disorders). Our aims are (1) to develop an innovative EEG-based BCI that achieves increased communication rates with fewer errors and greater satisfaction for the target SSPI populations; (2) to iteratively refine the system in the laboratory with user feedback from healthy subjects and expert LIS users of marketed AAC systems; (3) to evaluate the performance of the system within the natural clinical settings of SSPI patients. The innovative BCI is the RSVP Keyboard with three essential features: (1) rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of linguistic components ranging from letters to words to phrases; (2) a detection mechanism that employs multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and/or other suitable response mechanisms that can reliably indicate the binary intent of the user and adapt based on individualized neurophysiologic data of the user; and (3) an open-vocabulary natural language model with a capability for accurate predictions of upcoming text. Theoretical framework is based on a solid Bayesian foundation; clinical usability is based on the WHO ICF (WHO, 2001) and an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) model of participation. Rigorous experimental scrutiny in both clinical laboratory and natural settings will be obtained with able-bodied subjects and SSPI patients. Measures of learning rate, speed of message production, error rate and user satisfaction for different iterations of the RSVP keyboard will be obtained using an hypothesis-driven crossover design for 36 healthy subjects, and alternating treatment randomization design for 40 patients with SSPI. Descriptions of the motor, cognitive, and language skills of LIS patients using the novel system in their natural environments will inform clinical guidelines and functional device adaptations to better individualize treatment for children and adults with SSPI. The collaborative nature of the proposed translational research is expected to yield new knowledge for both BCI development and clinical AAC use.    Relevance: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily care giving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The RSVP keyboard and proposed language models are innovative technological discoveries that are being applied to clinical augmentative communication tools so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care.

"Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        	Epidemiologic analyses of health care data can provide critical evidence on the effectiveness and safety of therapeutics. This is particularly vital during the transition from the point of regulatory approval through the early marketing of new drugs, a time when physicians, regulators and payers are all struggling with incomplete data. Health plans pay for these drugs without knowing how their effectiveness and safety compares with established alternatives, as new compounds are tested against placebos rather than active agents, and tested only in selected patients. Non-randomized studies in large healthcare databases can provide fast and less costly evidence on drug effects. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a small number of investigator-specified confounders often fail and may produce biased results.     We propose and have preliminary evidence that employing modern medical informatics algorithms that structure and search databases to empirically identify thousands of new covariates. These will then enter established propensity score-based models and so make far more effective use of the information contained in health care databases and electronic medical records (EMRs), resulting in more valid causal interpretations of treatment effects. We will:    - Develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims and EMR databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. The performance of these approaches will be evaluated in 6 example studies encompassing recent drug safety and comparative effectiveness problems, and will be implemented in multiple large claims databases supplemented by such data as lab values and EMR information in subgroups.    -- Develop novel methods for confounding adjustment based on textual information found in EMRs.    -- Expand the newly developed mining algorithms into a framework that integrates distributed database networks with uneven information content, similar to the Sentinel Network recently initiated by FDA.                            This project is likely to produce groundbreaking results at the interface of medicine, biomedical informatics, and epidemiologic methods. After completion of this project a library of documented and validated algorithms will be available to significantly improve confounder control in a range of healthcare databases. The theoretical foundation and the ready-to-use algorithms will likely lead to a fundamental shift in how databases contribute to the fast and accurate assessment of newly-marketed medications.            Large healthcare databases are used to assess the safety and effectiveness of drugs. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a limited number of investigator-specific covariates often fail to produce unbiased results. We will develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims data and electronic medical records databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. This will result in improved causal inference on the comparative safety and effectiveness of newly marketed medications that is both less susceptible to investigator omissions and faster than conventional approaches.",Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects,8143550,R01LM010213,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Distributed Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly woman', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Head', 'Health Planning', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Marketing', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Scoring Method', 'Sentinel', 'Severity of illness', 'Solid', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'data mining', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lectures', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'routine care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2011,389385,-0.008267808452077823

"Near Miss Narratives from the Fire Service: A Bayesian Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will analyze the narrative text fields in all National Fire Fighter Near-Miss Reporting System (NFFNMRS) reports submitted since the system was created in 2005 (3,695 reports as of September 30, 2009). Near miss reporting systems have made major contributions to safety in such industries as aviation, nuclear power, petrochemical processing, steel production, and military operations, because the same patterns of causes of failure and their relations precede both adverse events and near misses. However, firefighters and researchers lack a scientific system to fully analyze the near miss data collected each year. This innovative effort will advance knowledge in firefighter safety by applying novel Bayesian methods of analysis to the narrative text fields of a new data source that has not yet been rigorously investigated. The proposal has 3 aims:  I. to use recently developed auto coding methods to characterize firefighter near miss narratives and classify these narratives into mechanisms of risk/injury. This analysis will apply the International Classification of External Cause of Injuries (ICECI) using Bayesian machine learning techniques to identify the various mechanisms captured in the near miss narratives and their relative prevalence.  II. To identify the correlation between each mechanism of risk/injury and each of the ""Contributing Factors"" listed on the NFFNMRS reporting form. The results will reveal any patterns and trends in the distribution of the contributing factors among the mechanisms, creating a deeper understanding of near miss circumstances, as well as a basis for improving the quality of future near miss data collection.  III. To use manual coding to identify actual injury incidents contained within a random sample of 1,000 near miss narratives and correlate these injuries with the ""Loss Potential"" categories on the NFFNMRS reporting form. The results will demonstrate how actual injuries are distributed within the reporting form's ""Loss Potential"" categories. This proposed study of the near miss narrative text in combination with coded data has the potential to reveal new insights that can strengthen firefighter safety through primary prevention. This study addresses a major gap in firefighter safety knowledge, i.e. the insufficient understanding of near miss events, and will have a high impact on efforts to improve the occupational health and safety of firefighters.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This study will analyze the narrative text fields in all National Fire Fighter Near-Miss Reporting System (NFFNMRS) reports submitted since the system was created in 2005 (3,695 reports as of September 30, 2009).

"USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF COPING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of action is key to improving psychosocial interventions for cancer and other chronic disease conditions. In cancer, emotional expression has been identified as one possible mediator of the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient-reported outcomes. However, scientific evaluations of psychological mechanisms of adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases are constrained by limitations associated with self-report measures. Because self-care resources, peer-to-peer networks, and more recent forms of psychosocial intervention are increasingly being delivered online, linguistic and behavioral data can be used to characterize internal coping processes, social interactions, and other manifest behaviors. Few tools are currently available for harnessing text as a potential data source, and signal detection indices of existing tools leave room for considerable improvement in these methodologies (Bantum & Owen, 2009). In the present study, natural language processing and other tools of computational linguistics will be used to develop a machine-learning classifier to identify emotional expression in electronic text data. The aims of the study are: 1) to annotate a large text corpus from cancer survivors using an objective and reliable emotion-coding procedure, 2) to incorporate linguistic and psychological features into a machine-learning classification method and identify which of these features are most strongly associated with codes assigned by trained human raters, and 3) to develop combined psychological and natural language processing (NLP) methods for identifying linguistic markers of emotional coping behaviors. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive corpus of emotionally-laden cancer communications will be developed from 5 existing linguistic datasets. Five raters will be selected and undergo a rigorous training procedure for coding emotional expression using an emotion-coding system previously developed by the research. Coding will take place using an Internet-based coding interface that will allow the investigators to continuously monitor inter-rater reliability. Simultaneous with the coding process, the investigators will link the electronic text data with key linguistic and psychological features, including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), WordNet, part of speech tags, patterns of capitalization and punctuation, emoticons, and textual context. A machine-learning classifier, using tools of natural language processing, will then be applied to the text/feature data and validated against human-rated emotion codes. The long-term objective of this research is to advance a methodology for objectively identifying coping behavior, particularly emotional expression, in order to supplement self-report measures and improve scientific understanding of adjustment to chronic disease, trauma, or other psychological conditions. This work is essential for identifying mechanisms of action in psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors and others and has significance for the fields of medicine, psychology, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being. To date, the study of these factors as mechanisms of action has been limited to self-report measures that may not correlate well with other more objective indicators. The proposed study will improve our ability to identify mechanisms of action by supplementing self-report measures with objectively identified markers of coping behaviors such as emotional expression in natural language used by individuals living with cancer.           Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being.

"A Hybrid General Natural Language Processing Architecture    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic medical records and exchanges offer new opportunities for the analysis of population health data; however, new methods in natural language processing (NLP) must first be developed to structure and codify these records, since most medical data is in the form of free text which cannot be stored and manipulated by computers. Once this is accomplished, population health data can be analyzed which will lead to better treatment guidelines, targeted drug therapy, and more cost effective care. Logical Semantics, Inc. (LSI) proposes to develop new statistical NLP methods for analyzing large scale medical domains. These methods will leverage LSI's semantic annotation technology, which has created the largest semantically annotated clinical corpus in the world.

"Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key prerequisite for high-quality healthcare delivery is effective communication within and across healthcare settings. However, communication can be hampered by the pervasive use of abbreviations in clinical notes. Clinicians use abbreviations to save time during documentation. While abbreviations may seem unambiguous to their authors, they often cause confusion to other readers, including healthcare providers, patients, and natural language processing (NLP) systems attempting to extract clinical terms from text. While the understanding that abbreviations can cause errors is widespread, few have deployed pragmatic solutions for this important problem. The proposed project will develop, evaluate, and share a systematic approach to Clinical Abbreviation Recognition and Disambiguation (CARD), and in doing so substantially aims to benefit existing NLP systems and to improve computer-based documentation systems by reducing ambiguities in electronic records in real-time. The study includes the following five Specific Aims: 1) Develop automated methods to detect abbreviations and their senses from clinical text corpora and build a comprehensive knowledge base of clinical abbreviations; 2) Develop and evaluate three automated word sense disambiguation (WSD) classifiers, and establish methods to combine those classifiers to maximize both their performance and coverage; 3) Develop the CARD system, and demonstrate its effectiveness by integrating it with two established NLP systems (MedLEE and KnowledgeMap); 4) Integrate CARD with an institutional clinical documentation system (Vanderbilt's StarNotes) and evaluate its ability to expand abbreviations in real-time as clinicians generate records; 5) Distribute the CARD knowledge base and software for non-commercial uses.              Project Narrative Abbreviations are widely used throughout all types of clinical documents and they cause confusion to both healthcare providers and patients and limit effective communications within and across care settings. This proposed study will develop informatics methods to automatically detect abbreviations and their possible meanings from large clinical text and to disambiguate abbreviations that have multiple meanings. We will also integrate those methods with clinical documentation systems so that abbreviations will be expanded in real-time when physicians entering clinical notes, thus to improve the quality of health records.",Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes,7866149,R01LM010681,"['Abbreviations', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Confusion', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Frequencies', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nitroglycerin', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Reader', 'Records', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'acronyms', 'base', 'health care delivery', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'phrases', 'satisfaction']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,387500,0.04536975836684075
"Natural Language Processing to Study Epidemiology of Statin Side Effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-101: Informatics for post-marketing surveillance. The overall goal of this study is to develop a generalizable framework for studying medication side effects recorded in narrative medical documents. We will implement and test this system on the example of epidemiologic characterization of side effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (a.k.a. statins). Statins are the most commonly used class of medications for treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the U.S. In randomized clinical trials statins are associated only with a slight increase in adverse reactions and no increase in discontinuation of treatment compared to placebo. However, in clinical practice the rates of side effects and discontinuation appear significantly higher and represent a major barrier to a critical, potentially lifesaving therapy. For example, myalgias are reported to be relatively rare in clinical trials but are thought to be more common in clinical practice. Additionally, a number of other statin-associated complaints reported anecdotally but not well elucidated in clinical trials include depression, irritability, and memory loss among others. Most of these have been poorly epidemiologically characterized and their prevalence and risk factors remain unknown. Structured electronic medical record (EMR) and administrative data have been used to study medication side effects. However, structured data have important limitations. They may not contain temporal or causative information necessary to link particular problems to medications and may not be sufficiently granular to identify specific adverse reactions. Narrative EMR data, such as provider notes, can provide documentation of causative links between medication and adverse events at high levels of granularity. Natural language processing (NLP) is an emerging technology that enables computational abstraction of information from narrative medical documents. In prior work we have successfully applied natural language processing to abstract medication information from narrative provider notes, including medication intensification, medication non-adherence and medication discontinuation. We will leverage these tools and the extensive EMR infrastructure at Partners HealthCare to develop and test a natural language processing system to study medication side effects. We will validate this system on the example of studying epidemiology of adverse reactions to statins. The findings of this project will lay the foundation for an open-source system that can be used for post-marketing surveillance of medication side effects using narrative EMR data.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Frequency and risk factors for side effects of statins (medications used to treat high cholesterol) in everyday medical practice (as opposed to research studies) are not known.

"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats.

"Natural Language Processing for Cancer Research Network Surveillance Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses Broad Challenge Area: (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic: 10-CA-107 Expand Spectrum of Cancer Surveillance through Informatics Approaches. The proposed project launches a collaborative effort to advance adoption within the HMO Cancer Research Network (CRN) of ""industrial-strength"" natural language processing (NLP) systems useful for mining valuable, research-grade information from unstructured clinical text. Such text is available for processing, now in the electronic medical record (EMR) systems of affiliated CRN health plans. The proposed NLP methods   will create ongoing capacity to tap what has recently been described as ""a treasure trove of historical   unstructured data that provides essential information for the study of disease progression, treatment   effectiveness and long-term outcomes"" (5). The vision of advancing widespread NLP capacity across the CRN, as well as the approach we present here for implementing it, grew out of an in-depth strategic planning effort we completed in December 2008. That effort involved participants from six CRN sites guided by a blue-ribbon panel of NLP experts from three of the nation's leading centers of clinical NLP research: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Vanderbilt University, and Mayo Clinic. The vision is to deploy a powerful NLP system locally, manage it with newly hired and trained local NLP technical staff, and conduct NLP-based research projects initiated by local investigators, in consultation with higher-level external NLP experts. Our planning efforts suggest this collaborative model is feasible; we will test the model in the context of the proposed project. An important development in April 2009 yielded what we believe is a potentially transformative opportunity to accelerate adoption of NLP capacity in applied research settings: release of the open-source Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) software. This software was the result of a collaborative effort between IBM and Mayo Clinic. Built on the same framework Mayo Clinic currently uses to process its repository of over 40 million clinical documents, cTAKES dramatically lowers the cost of adopting a comprehensive and flexible NLP system. Deployment and use of such systems was previously only feasible in institutions with large, academically-oriented biomedical informatics research programs.   Still, other deployment challenges and the need to acquire NLP training for local staff present residual   barriers to adopting comprehensive NLP systems such as cTAKES. In collaboration with five other CRN sites the proposed project mitigates these challenges in two ways: 1) it develops configurable open-source software modules needed to streamline and therefore reduce the cost of deploying cTAKES, and 2) it presents and tests a model for training local staff through hands-on NLP projects overseen by outside NLP expert consultants. The potential impact of this project is evident most clearly in the vast untapped opportunities for text mining represented in CRN-affiliated health plans, where EMR systems have been in place since at least 2005, and whose patients represent 4% of the U.S. population. Clinical text mining offers the potential to provide new or improved data elements for cancer surveillance and other types of research requiring information about patient functional status, medication side-effects, details of therapeutic approaches, and differential information about clinical findings. Another significant impact of this project is its plan to integrate into the cTAKES system   an open-source de-identification tool based on state of the art, best of breed NLP approaches developed by the MITRE Corporation. De-identification of clinical text will make it easier for researchers to get access to clinical text, and will also facilitate multi-site collaborations while protecting patient privacy. Finally, if successful, the NLP algorithm we propose as a proof-of-principle project at Group Health-which will classify sets of patient charts as either containing or not containing a diagnosis of recurrent breast cancer-could dramatically reduce the cost of research in this area; currently all recurrent breast cancer endpoints must be established through costly manual chart abstraction.   Novel aspects of the proposed project include its talented and transdisciplinary research team,   including national experts in NLP, and its resourceful strategy for building the technical resources and ""human capital"" needed to support an ongoing program of applied NLP research. Natural language processing is itself a highly innovative technology; when successfully established in multiple CRN in the future it will represent a watershed moment in the CRN's already impressive history of exploiting data systems to support innovative research. Newly hired staff positions total approximately 2.0 FTE in each project year, most of which we anticipate will be supported by ongoing new research programs after the proposed project concludes. Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches. Because these methods are generic they will potentially contribute to public health by advancing research in a wide variety of areas. The ""proof of principle"" algorithm developed in the project to identify recurrent breast cancer diagnoses will advance epidemiologic and clinical research pertaining to the 2.5 million women currently living with breast cancer.           Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches.

"Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance patient safety and reduce the cost of medical care by discovering novel adverse drug events (ADEs) through use of automated methods. We will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and data mining methodologies on vast quantities of clinical data in electronic health records (EHRs) to detect novel ADE signals. ADEs are major problems world-wide and cause hospitalizations, deaths, and incur a huge cost to health care. Therefore, continued post-marketing surveillance encompassing large and varied patient populations is crucial for patient safety. EHRs contain a comprehensive amount of clinical information, which if harnessed properly, would be invaluable for pharmacovigilance. We have already demonstrated that we can accurately encode information in clinical reports using the NLP system MedLEE, and that we can accurately detect associations among clinical events using statistical methods that we developed. Therefore, this is an excellent opportunity to continue our research accomplishments and to advance the state of the art in pharmacovigilance.       More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map comprehensive clinical information in the EHR to codified data, and then statistical methods will be used to generate an extensive knowledge base of disease-symptom, disease-drug, drug-drug, and drug-symptom associations, which will be used to discover new ADEs. Additionally, we will develop methods to determine the correct sequence of drug, disease, and symptom events, which is critical for detecting ADEs. We will also develop methods to map fine-grained concepts into higher level concepts, which is important for optimizing the statistical methods. The performance of our discovery methods will be evaluated by testing the methods using drugs currently in use with known ADEs, and also by using historical rollback. We will first focus on discovery of short-term events using inpatient records, and then longer-term events using outpatient office visits.       This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods based on spontaneous reporting databases and administrative databases. We are confident the methods will be effective because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in this proposal presents an excellent chance to dramatically improve patient safety and reduce costs.               This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by developing effective methods for the discovery of new adverse drug events. The use of natural language processing on vast quantities of EHR records will result in the harnessing of comprehensive clinical information for this purpose, overcoming some of the limitations of current methods that rely on spontaneous reporting and administrative databases.","Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR",7779983,R01LM010016,"['Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Arts', 'Back', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Office Visits', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'administrative database', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'drug testing', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'statistics', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2010,343397,0.0493364498779268
"Using medical records repositories to improve the alert system design    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Rapid and accurate alerting of concerning patient events and conditions remains an important problem in clinical practice. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into the monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming and costly to extract and codify such knowledge; hence such systems are typically built to cover only very specific conditions. In addition, it is difficult for an expert to foresee the performance of the deployed systems and their potential drawbacks, especially their false alarm rates. It is not uncommon that computer alerting systems are discarded or must undergo multiple costly modification cycles before they reach clinically acceptable levels of performance.    Electronic health record (EHR) repositories today provide an opportunity to test various theories and develop new computational solutions to various clinical problems. The objective of this project is to investigate methods for using the data in such repositories to assist in the development of alerting systems. The project goals include the building of an evidence-driven framework for the evaluation and optimization of alerting systems with the help of past data. The framework will be able to provide early feedback and future performance estimates of an alerting system before it is deployed, which is anticipated to decrease the expert effort required to design such a system and lead to a shorter alerting system design cycle. The evidence-driven framework will be tested and evaluated on multiple clinical conditions and compared to the performance of alerting rules currently deployed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). The project investigators consist of a multidisciplinary team with expertise in rule-based alerting in the hospital setting, clinical pharmacy, laboratory medicine, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, and knowledge based systems.           Project Narrative: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors by sending computer-based reminders and alerts to clinicians.

"Integrated discovery and hypothesis testing of new associations in rare diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rare diseases are studied in isolated laboratories, forgotten by main stream pharmacological companies, and considered almost academic curiosities. Finding variables that correlate/cause rare diseases (a condition is rare when it affects less than 1 person per 2,000) is a difficult task. The low number of cases and the sparse nature of the reports make it difficult to obtain significant/meaningful statistical results. There are two ways to avoid these problems. The first is to integrate reported cases and associations to generate enough statistical power. The second way is to have an independent data set, big enough to cover rare cases. Each of the two methods has intrinsic problems. For instance, the search in the literature puts together different studies, each of them with their own biases in population, methodology and objectives. On the other hand, blind searches for associations in big databases introduce a large number of false positives due to multiple hypothesis testing.       These problems could be avoided by developing innovative methods that allow the integration of information and methodologies in the literature and longitudinal databases. To achieve this goal, we propose a team that combines expertise in natural language processing systems (Carol Friedman), electronic health records (George Hripcsak), statistics in combined databases and computational virology (Raul Rabadan). This team will generate an interdisciplinary approach to mine and integrate the literature and the dataset collected at Columbia/New York Presbyterian hospital. Identifying unusual correlations in rare diseases is the first step to understanding the origin of the diseases and to finding a cure for them. We hypothesize that we will develop effective methods aimed at improving our understanding of rare diseases by combining hypothesis testing and hypothesis discovery, and by integrating information from the literature and from the patient record to obtain increased statistical power.

"An NLP Approach to Generating Patient Record Summaries :  The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the manner in which physicians access, process and marshal medical information by providing them with an automatically generated, comprehensive, and up-to date summary of the information appearing in a patient record. At the point of patient care, physicians must often rapidly process a potentially overwhelming quantity of information pertaining to a patient. Failure to do so effectively may lead to provision of suboptimal care. Some electronic health record systems provide an automatically produced “cover sheet” geared to help physicians with a broad overview of a given patient, but the information is derived from the structured data fields in the patient record, ignoring the valuable narrative text entered by clinicians over time. We are building upon our prior work in summarization and natural language processing and leveraging our expertise in cognitive research studying information needs and decision making of clinicians to build a patient record summarizer that gathers information narrative (unstructured) as well as structured parts in the record. We focus on producing a summary for patients with kidney disease, as they often have a complex medical history with numerous conditions, procedures and medications. Providing a holistic, up-to-date summary of their chart would prove valuable to physicians in general and nephrologists in particular. The following three aims will be carried out: (1) conduct a formative study to determine how physicians prioritize and mentally represent relevant information when reviewing a patient chart; (2) create a set of automated methods to select salient pieces of information in the patient record and organize them into a coherent summary; and (3) evaluate the efficacy, efficiency and physician-user satisfaction associated with the use of the summarizer. A primary strength of this proposal is that we are addressing the problem of information overload, a bottleneck in the use of electronic health records, and evaluate the impact of our solution on clinicians’ actions and patients’ health outcomes. Furthermore, we propose to use novel natural language processing, knowledge-based and data mining methods to extract and organize salient information. Finally, we contribute to informatics research by extending the electronic health record functionalities to go beyond a simple documentation-entry system towards a useful reference and decision-making tool for physicians  Project Narrative We propose to design an automatically generated, comprehensive, and up-to-date summary of the information appearing in a patient record.

"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text.

Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports.

"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap.

"Annotation, development and evaluation for clinical information extraction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much of the clinical information required for accurate clinical research, active decision support, and broad-coverage surveillance is locked in text files in an electronic medical record (EMR). The only feasible way to leverage this information for translational science is to extract and encode the information using natural language processing (NLP). Over the last two decades, several research groups have developed NLP tools for clinical notes, but a major bottleneck preventing progress in clinical NLP is the lack of standard, annotated data sets for training and evaluating NLP applications. Without these standards, individual NLP applications abound without the ability to train different algorithms on standard annotations, share and integrate NLP modules, or compare performance. We propose to develop standards and infrastructure that can enable technology to extract scientific information from textual medical records, and we propose the research as a collaborative effort involving NLP experts across the U.S. To accomplish this goal, we will address three specific aims: Aim 1: Extend existing standards and develop new consensus standards for annotating clinical text in a way that is interoperable, extensible, and usable. Aim 2: Apply existing methods and tools, and develop new methods and tools where necessary for manually annotating a set of publicly available clinical texts in a way that is efficient and accurate. Aim 3: Develop a publicly available toolkit for automatically annotating clinical text and perform a shared evaluation to evaluate the toolkit, using evaluation metrics that are multidimensional and flexible.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research. We will experiment with methods for increasing the efficiency of annotation and will annotate de-identified reports of nine types for linguistic and clinical information. In addition, we will create an NLP toolkit that can be shared and will evaluate it against other NLP systems in a shared task evaluation with the community.           Project narrative: In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research.

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.           Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2) Project Narrative When completed successfully, the eTfor2 project will enable researchers at disparate institutions to extract from their respective EMR systems a shared ""target"" set of common phenomic descriptors, in a standard, reproducible manner.

"An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records DESCRIPTION: Observational epidemiological studies are effective methods for identifying factors affecting the health and illness of populations, as well as for determining optimal treatments for diseases, such as cancers. However, conventional epidemiological research usually involves personnel-intensive effort (such as manual chart and public records review) and can be very time consuming before conclusive results are obtained. Recently, a large amount of detailed longitudinal clinical data has been accumulated at hospitals' Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and it has become a valuable data source for epidemiological studies. However, there are two obstacles that prevent the wide usage of EMR data in epidemiological studies. First, most of the detailed clinical information in EMRs is embedded in narrative text and it is very costly to extract that information manually. Second, EMRs usually have data quality problems such as selection bias and missing data, which require adaptation of conventional statistical methods developed for randomized controlled trials.   In this study, we propose an in silico informatics-based approach for observational epidemiological studies using EMR data. We hypothesize that existing EMR data can be used for certain types of epidemiological studies in a very efficient manner with the help of informatics methods. The informatics-based approach will contain two major components. One is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) based information extraction system that can automatically extract detailed clinical information from EMR and another is a set of statistical and informatics methods that can be used to analyze EMR-derived data. If the feasibility of this approach is proven, it will change the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research, because it has the capability to answer an epidemiological question in a very short time at a very low cost. The specific aim of this study is to develop an automated informatics approach to extract both fine-grained cancer findings and general clinical information from EMRs and use them to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies. We will perform both casecontrol and cohort studies related to prevention and treatment of breast and colon cancers using EMR data. The informatics approach will be validated on EMRs from two major hospitals to demonstrate its generalizability. Epidemiological findings from our study will be compared to reported findings for validation. Narrative: According to the American Cancer Society, about 7.6 million people died from various types of cancer in the world during 2007. It is very important to identify risk factors of  cancers and to determine optimal treatments of cancers, and epidemiological study is  one of the methods to achieve it. This proposed study will use natural language  processing technologies to automatically extract fine-grained cancer information from  existing patient electronic medical records and use it to conduct cancer related  epidemiological studies, thus accelerating knowledge accumulation of cancer research.",An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records,7925776,R01CA141307,"['Affect', 'American Cancer Society', 'Breast', 'Cereals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection Bias', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cost', 'prevent']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,259993,-0.007221809259965854

"Online Social Networking as an Alternative Information Source for Clinical Resear    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical trials and patient records have been the main information sources for clinical research. While well- designed clinical trials can produce high quality data, they are generally very expensive and time consuming. Prior studies have also shown that patients enrolled in clinical trials are not necessarily representative of the general patient population. Chart reviews, which rely on the patient records, avoid some of the drawbacks of the clinical trials approach. Although chart review studies are more labor intensive, new developments in structured data entry and natural language processing (NLP) are helping to automate the process. However, studies which use chart reviews are limited by the accuracy and completeness of the data in the records.       In the past decade, online social networks have grown exponentially. Some health-focused social network sites have attracted large numbers of users and begun accumulating large quantities of detailed clinical information. The PatientsLikeMe site, for instance, has about 3,200 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients worldwide, and includes about 5% of the ALS population in the US. Information gathered by online social networks is primarily intended for patients to share with each other. Such information has also begun to attract the attention of medical researchers.[3, 4]       Because using information from online social networks for medical research is a fairly new phenomenon, the value and limitation of this type of information source have not been systematically examined. To do so, we propose to conduct a comparison study of patient-contributed information from PatientsLikeMe and records from a large medical record data repository - the Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) of the Partners Healthcare Systems. The proposed study will focus on ALS, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). The general goal is to explore how the medical record and online networking data differ, and if and how online networking data could complement the medical record data. The specific aims are:    1) Extract symptom and treatment information from the two different data sources.    2) Compare the prevalence of symptoms and treatments from the two information sources and analyze the difference.    3) Extract treatment response of prescription medications from PatientsLikeMe and analyze the confounding effect of the misunderstanding of medication indication.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will investigate an emerging data source for clinical research: online social network. This data source may complement and supplement the data from clinical trials and medical records, with a unique emphasis on patients' experience and perspectives.           The proposed project will investigate an emerging data source for clinical research: online social network.

"Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The goals of our project are as follows:     1. Create a corpus of temporally annotated data. Under the supervision of our consultants Dr. Frank Sacks, Dr. Vincent Carey, and two Registered Nurses, we will create a gold-standard annotation of events and temporal information within patient narratives from de- identified Electronic Health Record data using the CLEF and TimeML guidelines. We will use the framework of the Brandeis Annotation Tool, a system we have designed to facilitate the quick construction of accurately annotated corpora against a specified guideline. Extensions to the current event library and lexicon with medical event references will be made during the annotation process, under the guidance of the Registered Nurses.          2. Adapt the TARSQI Toolkit (TTK) to targeted temporal properties and relations in the EHR domain. We will use the TARSQI toolkit, a robust set of temporal processing algorithms we have designed for parsing natural language text, to automatically annotate the events and temporal information in EHR data. Combined with the Brandeis AcroMed Medical Abbreviation Server and those terms introduced in part 1, we will employ the Specialist Lexicon and other medical resources to extend the toolkit capabilities for recognizing and interpreting medical event information. Algorithms for identifying events, temporal expressions, and event anchorings and orderings will be trained against the gold standard created in Aim 1, and tested against held-out data.     3. Create a cross-document temporal database of medical events. Using the recognition algorithms introduced in Aim 2, we will create a searchable, temporally ordered database of medical events such as diseases, symptoms, surgeries/interventions, and test results.

"Voice Based, Workflow Enhancing, Primary Care Medical Data Input System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) in hospitals and physician offices has been widely promoted as a single solution to a wide variety of health care issues. Yet 84% of small and medium business (SMB) physician practices in the US have not adopted EHR systems. Interventional Dynamics Corporation (IDC) has conducted more than 200 primary care physician interviews, finding that the major disincentives to adoption are workflow delay and expense. The single greatest factor in the reduction of workflow speed is the data input process. IDC's proposed project has this specific aim: Utilize an innovative voice entry technique and open source code systems to develop a low-cost, automated solution to allow primary care physicians to complete a primary care note entirely during the patient examination process. The narrative speech input will be analyzed in a context-sensitive, domain-restricted manner to produce structured clinical data that can be readily integrated into standards-compliant electronic medical records. By using speech inputs that are converted directly to relevant EHR entries, physicians can increase the accuracy of their notes, eliminate third party transcription errors and avoid workflow delays. The project approach will include:    Further testing and final development of DocTalk, the IDC patent pending speech system that allows accurate natural language processing of structured medical information; Development of a proof-of-concept data system that converts physician voice input from voice to text to structured text to EHR data using domain enhanced open source code; The evaluation of the effectiveness of the proof-of-concept system against traditional EHR  input methods with the following goals: Achieve 50% or more reduction in charting time,  achieve 90% or more accuracy in output, and score greater than 4 of 5 on subjective  metrics including learnability, workflow fit, usability, and overall satisfaction. Successful completion of the proposed program will provide IDC with a viable technology platform that can immediately be useful to primary care physicians in generating structured documents for use with their current EHR platforms. Furthermore, the technology developed and refined within this program can be expanded in multiple ways.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The IDC technology is designed to circumvent the normal barriers to adoption in the SMB market and allow for quick increases in workflow and quality of patient care at a minimal price point. IDC will provide physicians who currently use pen and paper a more natural and faster way to input clinical data, eliminating time spent on hunt-and-peck keyboard entry or complicated EHR screen navigation. The system will generate structured clinical data that enables the exchange of health information, the portability of patient records, billing, data analytics (both local practice and public health), marketing, and other benefits, resulting in the reduction of overall healthcare costs.           Narrative The IDC technology is designed to circumvent the normal barriers to adoption in the SMB market and allow for quick increases in workflow and quality of patient care at a minimal price point.

"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors. We subscribe to a vision of Personalized Medicine in which genomic and other patient-specific information drives personalized, predictive, preemptive, and participatory health care, and VGER represents an important step in that direction.           n/a",Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project,7893787,U01HG004603,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Ethics', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Ethics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'egg', 'endophenotype', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rhythm', 'indexing', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'repository', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2010,1512082,0.03980435374933291
"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4. Perform a series of GWA analyses in the GHC biorepository and linked biorepositories. 4a: Alzheimer's disease (AD). 4b: Carotid artery atherosclerotic disease (CAAD). 4c: Complications of statin use, including elevations of CPK and muscle pain.       Through cooperation with other investigators and the NHGRI, this work will facilitate development of policies and procedures to realize the incredible potential of EMR-linked biorepositories for GWA studies to improve understanding, prevention and treatment of chronic diseases and illnesses. Specific GWA research will allow us to explore both etiologic research (AD and CAAD progression) and pharmacogenetics (statin therapy).

"Translational refinement of adaptive communication system for locked-in patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proliferation of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology promises locked-in patients potential ways to communicate successfully. Most BCI systems either involve selection from among a set of simultaneously presented stimuli, requiring extensive control of the interface; or use binary stimulus selection mechanisms that fail to achieve high communication rates because of slow intent detection or a fixed (context independent) ordering of stimuli. We propose a new interface using binary selection of text input via rapid serial visual presentation of natural language components. Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from acquired neurological disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) and neurodevelopmental disorders (cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy) drive the proposed research. Four laboratories form an alliance for this translational research project: basic research (Erdogmus, engineering; Roark, computer science and natural language processing), and clinical research (Oken, neurology/neurophysiology; Fried-Oken, augmentative communication/neurogenic communication disorders). Our aims are (1) to develop an innovative EEG-based BCI that achieves increased communication rates with fewer errors and greater satisfaction for the target SSPI populations; (2) to iteratively refine the system in the laboratory with user feedback from healthy subjects and expert LIS users of marketed AAC systems; (3) to evaluate the performance of the system within the natural clinical settings of SSPI patients. The innovative BCI is the RSVP Keyboard with three essential features: (1) rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of linguistic components ranging from letters to words to phrases; (2) a detection mechanism that employs multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and/or other suitable response mechanisms that can reliably indicate the binary intent of the user and adapt based on individualized neurophysiologic data of the user; and (3) an open-vocabulary natural language model with a capability for accurate predictions of upcoming text. Theoretical framework is based on a solid Bayesian foundation; clinical usability is based on the WHO ICF (WHO, 2001) and an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) model of participation. Rigorous experimental scrutiny in both clinical laboratory and natural settings will be obtained with able-bodied subjects and SSPI patients. Measures of learning rate, speed of message production, error rate and user satisfaction for different iterations of the RSVP keyboard will be obtained using an hypothesis-driven crossover design for 36 healthy subjects, and alternating treatment randomization design for 40 patients with SSPI. Descriptions of the motor, cognitive, and language skills of LIS patients using the novel system in their natural environments will inform clinical guidelines and functional device adaptations to better individualize treatment for children and adults with SSPI. The collaborative nature of the proposed translational research is expected to yield new knowledge for both BCI development and clinical AAC use.    Relevance: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily care giving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The RSVP keyboard and proposed language models are innovative technological discoveries that are being applied to clinical augmentative communication tools so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care. The proposed project stresses the translation of basic computer science into clinical care, supporting the proposed NIH Roadmap and public health initiatives.              Public health relevance statement: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life.

"Enhancing Clinical Effectiveness Research with Natural Language Processing of EMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To successfully use large linked clinical databases for comparative effectiveness research (CER) requires addressing some key informatics challenges associated with distributed, heterogeneous clinical data. Electronic networks of researchers are part of the solution because they can bridge the physical and organizational divides created by distinct health systems' individual electronic medical records (EMRs). In addition, informatics research has demonstrated the feasibility of automatically coding clinical text, enhancing the capacity to integrate both unstructured and non-standardized clinical data from EMRs. With this study, we propose to develop CER infrastructure, make broadly available the proven MediClass technology for automated classification of EMRs containing both coded data and text clinical notes, and demonstrate the potential of this infrastructure for addressing CER questions within the asthma and tobacco-using patient populations of 6 diverse health systems. Asthma and smoking each impose huge and modifiable burdens on the healthcare system, and multiple morbidities related to asthma and smoking have been targeted by the IOM and AHRQ as priority areas in efforts to improve the healthcare system through comparative effectiveness research. We propose to develop, deploy, operate and evaluate the CER HUB, an Internet-based platform for conducting CER, and to demonstrate its utility in studying clinical interventions in asthma and smoking. Researchers who register to use the HUB, beginning with the research team from the 6 participating study sites, will be able to use a secure website to configure and download MediClass applications addressing CER questions within their respective healthcare organizations, to contribute these IRB-approved, processed datasets back to a centralized data coordinating center to be pooled with data similarly processed from other healthcare organizations, and to use the pooled database to answer diverse comparative effectiveness questions of large, real-world populations. A central function of the CER HUB will be facilitating (through online, interactive tools) development of a shared library of MediClass knowledge modules that afford uniform, standardized coding of EMR data. This shared library of knowledge modules could permit researchers to assess effectiveness in multiple areas of healthcare and gain access to data otherwise locked away in text clinical notes. A goal of the CER HUB is to accelerate creation of standardized knowledge used to normalize heterogeneous EMR data as representations of clinical events for CER. During the project period we will conduct 2 studies using this infrastructure to address the effectiveness of interventions for asthmatics and tobacco users across the 6 participating health systems. As an ongoing resource, the HUB will provide a collaborative development platform for enhancing comparative effectiveness research in potentially any health care domain.      CER researchers can build software applications that will process their EMRs, creating standardized datasets permitting CER using a secure website to configure and download MediClass applications addressing CER questions within their respective healthcare organizations, to contribute these IRB-approved, processed datasets back to a centralized data coordinating center to be pooled with data similarly processed from other healthcare organizations, and to use the pooled database to answer diverse comparative effectiveness questions of large, real-world populations      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Comparative effectiveness research (CER) requires that clinical data be in standard forms allowing multiple, large databases to be efficiently combined, and requires that all of the data be coded so that automated summarization of the data is possible. However, much of the clinical data necessary for CER is in the text clinical notes written by clinicians when caring for patients. We will build a centralized website where CER researchers can build software applications that will process their electronic medical records, including both the text and coded data, creating standardized datasets permitting comparative effectiveness research.

"Improving Outpatient Medication Lists Using Temporal Reasoning and Clinical Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accurate and complete medication lists are critical inputs to effective medication reconciliation to prevent medication prescribing and administration errors. Previous research aggregated structured medication data form multiple sources to generate and maintain a reconciled medication list. Medications documented in clinical texts also need to be reconciled. However, most reconciliation methods currently have limited capability to process textual data and temporal information (e.g., dates, duration and status). Our goal is to pilot and test methodologies and applications in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and temporal reasoning to facilitate the use of electronic clinical texts in order to improve the ""correctness"" and ""completeness"" of medication lists. Clinic notes and free-text ""comments"" fields in medication lists in an ambulatory electronic medical record system will be considered in the study. An NLP system and a temporal reasoning system will be adapted to automatically extract medication and associated temporal information from clinical texts and encode the medications using a controlled terminology. Multiple knowledge bases will be used to develop a mechanism to represent the timing of medication use, detect the changes (e.g., active or inactive), and then to organize medications into appropriate groups (e.g., by ingredient or by status). The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed methods and tools in improving the process of medication   reconciliation will be assessed. Domain experts will serve as judges to assess the success of capturing, coding, and organizing the medications and temporal information and also to evaluate whether our methods are complementary to those currently used for medication management.           Accurate and complete medication information at the point of care is crucial for delivery of high-quality care and prevention of adverse events. Most previous studies aggregated structured medication data from EMR and CPOE (Computerized Physician Order Entry) systems to generate and maintain a reconciled medication list. However, medications in non-structured narrative sources (such as clinic notes and free-text comments) must also be reconciled. Structured data presented in a standard, predictable form can be easily processed by a computer. By contrast, narrative data does not have a well-defined structure, so processing such data is very challenging. Our goal is to pilot and test methodologies and applications in the fields of natural language processing (any system that manipulates text) and temporal reasoning (e.g., identifying the timing of medication use) to facilitate the use of electronic clinical texts in order to improve the ""correctness"" and ""completeness"" of medication lists.

"Annotation, development and evaluation for clinical information extraction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much of the clinical information required for accurate clinical research, active decision support, and broad-coverage surveillance is locked in text files in an electronic medical record (EMR). The only feasible way to leverage this information for translational science is to extract and encode the information using natural language processing (NLP). Over the last two decades, several research groups have developed NLP tools for clinical notes, but a major bottleneck preventing progress in clinical NLP is the lack of standard, annotated data sets for training and evaluating NLP applications. Without these standards, individual NLP applications abound without the ability to train different algorithms on standard annotations, share and integrate NLP modules, or compare performance. We propose to develop standards and infrastructure that can enable technology to extract scientific information from textual medical records, and we propose the research as a collaborative effort involving NLP experts across the U.S. To accomplish this goal, we will address three specific aims: Aim 1: Extend existing standards and develop new consensus standards for annotating clinical text in a way that is interoperable, extensible, and usable. Aim 2: Apply existing methods and tools, and develop new methods and tools where necessary for manually annotating a set of publicly available clinical texts in a way that is efficient and accurate. Aim 3: Develop a publicly available toolkit for automatically annotating clinical text and perform a shared evaluation to evaluate the toolkit, using evaluation metrics that are multidimensional and flexible.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research.

"Data Structuring and Visualization System for Neuro-oncology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The medical record for a neuro-oncology patient is complex, consisting of typically a large number of both text and imaging data. It includes descriptions of prior observations, interpretations, and interventions which need to be integrated into decisions regarding current patient care. An appropriate review of a patient's medical record often requires that a physician review multiple clinical documents while mentally noting issues related to what the findings were, the chronology of events, spatial/temporal patterns of disease progression, the effects of interventions, and the possible causal lines of explanation of observed findings. Additionally, imaging data and imaging- derived conclusions are poorly integrated into patient care and management decisions. The physician also needs to filter out those pieces of information not related to the current clinical context of care. Given the time constraints, data complexity and data volume associated with chronic patient cases, an appropriate review of a patient's chart is in reality rarely performed. Additionally, the lack of tools for formalizing the representation of the accounts of current and prior cases impedes the development of clinical databases that can be ultimately used to learn patterns of disease.       This proposal addresses the development of a system for facilitating the review of clinical patient data intended to promote an orderly process of medical problem understanding and care. The specific aims of the proposal are summarized as follows: 1) Development of a backend tool to facilitate the structured representation of observations, events, and inferences stated within medical reports. 2) Development of an application interface for visualizing, navigating, and editing structured patient data. 3) Evaluation of the effectiveness of the application in the domain of neuro-oncology.       Relation to public health. If the goals of this proposal can be realized, neuro-oncologist should be able to more easily seek desired patient data and detect patterns of evidence as compared to the current mode of operation (HIS, RIS, PACS). The structuring tools should lead to improvements in the quality of clinical research databases.           Narrative Medical records for neuro-oncology patients are difficult to review due to volume and complexity of information.

Health plans pay for these drugs without knowing how their effectiveness and safety compares with established alternatives, as new compounds are tested against placebos rather than active agents, and tested only in selected patients. Non-randomized studies in large healthcare databases can provide fast and less costly evidence on drug effects. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a small number of investigator-specified confounders often fail and may produce biased results.     We propose and have preliminary evidence that employing modern medical informatics algorithms that structure and search databases to empirically identify thousands of new covariates. These will then enter established propensity score-based models and so make far more effective use of the information contained in health care databases and electronic medical records (EMRs), resulting in more valid causal interpretations of treatment effects. We will:    - Develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims and EMR databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. The performance of these approaches will be evaluated in 6 example studies encompassing recent drug safety and comparative effectiveness problems, and will be implemented in multiple large claims databases supplemented by such data as lab values and EMR information in subgroups.    -- Develop novel methods for confounding adjustment based on textual information found in EMRs.    -- Expand the newly developed mining algorithms into a framework that integrates distributed database networks with uneven information content, similar to the Sentinel Network recently initiated by FDA.                            This project is likely to produce groundbreaking results at the interface of medicine, biomedical informatics, and epidemiologic methods. After completion of this project a library of documented and validated algorithms will be available to significantly improve confounder control in a range of healthcare databases. The theoretical foundation and the ready-to-use algorithms will likely lead to a fundamental shift in how databases contribute to the fast and accurate assessment of newly-marketed medications.            Large healthcare databases are used to assess the safety and effectiveness of drugs. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a limited number of investigator-specific covariates often fail to produce unbiased results. We will develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims data and electronic medical records databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. This will result in improved causal inference on the comparative safety and effectiveness of newly marketed medications that is both less susceptible to investigator omissions and faster than conventional approaches.",Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects,7940855,R01LM010213,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Distributed Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Head', 'Health Planning', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Marketing', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Scoring Method', 'Sentinel', 'Severity of illness', 'Solid', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'data mining', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lectures', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'routine care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2010,417999,-0.008267808452077823
"Increasing Clinical Trial Enrollment: A Semi-Automated Patient Centered Approach No abstract available  Relevance The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application.

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ongoing goal of our project, ""Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,"" is to develop and apply methods to exploit electronic medical record data for decision support, with an emphasis on narrative data. Since the inception of our project as an R29 in 1994, we have been developing methods for preparing raw electronic medical record data, applying and evaluating natural language processing, developing data mining techniques including machine learning, and putting the results to use for clinical care and research.       In this competing continuation, we propose to address the temporal information in the electronic medical record and to apply natural language processing and temporal processing to the task of syndromic surveillance in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH).       We have begun work on a temporal processing system. It extracts temporal assertions stated in narrative reports, uses the MedLEE natural language processor to parse the non-temporal information, infers implicit temporal assertions based on a knowledge base, and produces the information in the form of a simple temporal constraint satisfaction problem. The latter can be used to answer questions about the time of events and the temporal relation between pairs of events. We propose to complete the system, expand the knowledge base, speed computation, address the uncertainty of temporal assertions, incorporate temporal information from structured data, and evaluate the system.       NYC DOHMH has a mature syndromic surveillance system that watches over almost eight million persons, and it has as-yet unexploited data sources in the form of narrative and structured electronic medical records. We propose to apply natural language processing and our proposed temporal processing to convert the data to a form appropriate for surveillance. We will evaluate the incremental benefit of structured data, narrative data, and temporally processed narrative data.           n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,7933293,R01LM006910,"['Address', 'Area', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Persons', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'data mining', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'satisfaction', 'syndromic surveillance']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,152617,0.047804324770905106
"Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Reports    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Analyzing and processing free-text medical reports for data mining and clinical data interchange is one of the most challenging problems in medical informatics, yet it is crucial for continued research advances and improvements in clinical care. Natural language processing (NLP) is an important enabling technology, but has been held back because it is difficult to understand human language, since it requires extensive domain knowledge. In Phase I, we developed new statistical and machine learning methods that apply domain specific knowledge to the semantic analysis of free-text radiology reports. The methods enabled the creation of two new prototype applications - a SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine--Clinical Terms) coding service called SnomedCoder, and a text mining tool for analyzing a large corpus of medical reports, called DataMiner. In Phase II, we will accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Improve the semantic extraction methods developed in Phase I, 2) Expand the semantic knowledge base and classify at least two million new unique sentences from multiple medical institutions, 3) Provide a SNOMED CT auto coding service (alpha service) to participating Indiana Health Information Exchange hospitals, and 4) Build a commercial version of the DataMiner software, and test its functionality using researchers at the Regenstrief Institute.       These scientific innovations will revolutionize the ability of health care researchers to analyze vast repositories of clinical information currently locked up in electronic medical records, and correlate this data with new biomedical discoveries in proteonomics and genomics. The ability to codify text rapidly will extend the potential for clinical decision support beyond its narrow base of numeric and structured medical data, and enable SNOMED CT to become a useful coding standard. Phase III will offer coding and data mining services to healthcare payers (both private and government), pharmaceuticals, and academic researchers. A key advantage of our approach over other NLP systems is that we attempt to codify all the information in the report and not just a limited subset, and insist on expert validation which provides a high degree of confidence in the accuracy of the coded data.Project Narrative           n/a",Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Reports,7554153,R44RR024929,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body of uterus', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Paper', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Trees', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical care', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'novel strategies', 'patient safety', 'prototype', 'repository', 'research and development', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCRR,"LOGICAL SEMANTICS, INC.",R44,2009,422728,0.015877683496977147
"Natural Language Processing to Study Epidemiology of Statin Side Effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-101: Informatics for post-marketing surveillance. The overall goal of this study is to develop a generalizable framework for studying medication side effects recorded in narrative medical documents. We will implement and test this system on the example of epidemiologic characterization of side effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (a.k.a. statins). Statins are the most commonly used class of medications for treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the U.S. In randomized clinical trials statins are associated only with a slight increase in adverse reactions and no increase in discontinuation of treatment compared to placebo. However, in clinical practice the rates of side effects and discontinuation appear significantly higher and represent a major barrier to a critical, potentially lifesaving therapy. For example, myalgias are reported to be relatively rare in clinical trials but are thought to be more common in clinical practice. Additionally, a number of other statin-associated complaints reported anecdotally but not well elucidated in clinical trials include depression, irritability, and memory loss among others. Most of these have been poorly epidemiologically characterized and their prevalence and risk factors remain unknown. Structured electronic medical record (EMR) and administrative data have been used to study medication side effects. However, structured data have important limitations. They may not contain temporal or causative information necessary to link particular problems to medications and may not be sufficiently granular to identify specific adverse reactions. Narrative EMR data, such as provider notes, can provide documentation of causative links between medication and adverse events at high levels of granularity. Natural language processing (NLP) is an emerging technology that enables computational abstraction of information from narrative medical documents. In prior work we have successfully applied natural language processing to abstract medication information from narrative provider notes, including medication intensification, medication non-adherence and medication discontinuation. We will leverage these tools and the extensive EMR infrastructure at Partners HealthCare to develop and test a natural language processing system to study medication side effects. We will validate this system on the example of studying epidemiology of adverse reactions to statins. The findings of this project will lay the foundation for an open-source system that can be used for post-marketing surveillance of medication side effects using narrative EMR data.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Frequency and risk factors for side effects of statins (medications used to treat high cholesterol) in everyday medical practice (as opposed to research studies) are not known. In this project we will design a system for analyzing the information about statin side effects in the electronic medical records.

"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats.

"Natural Language Processing for Cancer Research Network Surveillance Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses Broad Challenge Area: (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic: 10-CA-107 Expand Spectrum of Cancer Surveillance through Informatics Approaches. The proposed project launches a collaborative effort to advance adoption within the HMO Cancer Research Network (CRN) of ""industrial-strength"" natural language processing (NLP) systems useful for mining valuable, research-grade information from unstructured clinical text. Such text is available for processing, now in the electronic medical record (EMR) systems of affiliated CRN health plans. The proposed NLP methods   will create ongoing capacity to tap what has recently been described as ""a treasure trove of historical   unstructured data that provides essential information for the study of disease progression, treatment   effectiveness and long-term outcomes"" (5). The vision of advancing widespread NLP capacity across the CRN, as well as the approach we present here for implementing it, grew out of an in-depth strategic planning effort we completed in December 2008. That effort involved participants from six CRN sites guided by a blue-ribbon panel of NLP experts from three of the nation's leading centers of clinical NLP research: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Vanderbilt University, and Mayo Clinic. The vision is to deploy a powerful NLP system locally, manage it with newly hired and trained local NLP technical staff, and conduct NLP-based research projects initiated by local investigators, in consultation with higher-level external NLP experts. Our planning efforts suggest this collaborative model is feasible; we will test the model in the context of the proposed project. An important development in April 2009 yielded what we believe is a potentially transformative opportunity to accelerate adoption of NLP capacity in applied research settings: release of the open-source Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) software. This software was the result of a collaborative effort between IBM and Mayo Clinic. Built on the same framework Mayo Clinic currently uses to process its repository of over 40 million clinical documents, cTAKES dramatically lowers the cost of adopting a comprehensive and flexible NLP system. Deployment and use of such systems was previously only feasible in institutions with large, academically-oriented biomedical informatics research programs.   Still, other deployment challenges and the need to acquire NLP training for local staff present residual   barriers to adopting comprehensive NLP systems such as cTAKES. In collaboration with five other CRN sites the proposed project mitigates these challenges in two ways: 1) it develops configurable open-source software modules needed to streamline and therefore reduce the cost of deploying cTAKES, and 2) it presents and tests a model for training local staff through hands-on NLP projects overseen by outside NLP expert consultants. The potential impact of this project is evident most clearly in the vast untapped opportunities for text mining represented in CRN-affiliated health plans, where EMR systems have been in place since at least 2005, and whose patients represent 4% of the U.S. population. Clinical text mining offers the potential to provide new or improved data elements for cancer surveillance and other types of research requiring information about patient functional status, medication side-effects, details of therapeutic approaches, and differential information about clinical findings. Another significant impact of this project is its plan to integrate into the cTAKES system   an open-source de-identification tool based on state of the art, best of breed NLP approaches developed by the MITRE Corporation. De-identification of clinical text will make it easier for researchers to get access to clinical text, and will also facilitate multi-site collaborations while protecting patient privacy. Finally, if successful, the NLP algorithm we propose as a proof-of-principle project at Group Health-which will classify sets of patient charts as either containing or not containing a diagnosis of recurrent breast cancer-could dramatically reduce the cost of research in this area; currently all recurrent breast cancer endpoints must be established through costly manual chart abstraction.   Novel aspects of the proposed project include its talented and transdisciplinary research team,   including national experts in NLP, and its resourceful strategy for building the technical resources and ""human capital"" needed to support an ongoing program of applied NLP research. Natural language processing is itself a highly innovative technology; when successfully established in multiple CRN in the future it will represent a watershed moment in the CRN's already impressive history of exploiting data systems to support innovative research. Newly hired staff positions total approximately 2.0 FTE in each project year, most of which we anticipate will be supported by ongoing new research programs after the proposed project concludes.

Because these methods are generic they will potentially contribute to public health by advancing research in a wide variety of areas.

"Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance patient safety and reduce the cost of medical care by discovering novel adverse drug events (ADEs) through use of automated methods. We will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and data mining methodologies on vast quantities of clinical data in electronic health records (EHRs) to detect novel ADE signals. ADEs are major problems world-wide and cause hospitalizations, deaths, and incur a huge cost to health care. Therefore, continued post-marketing surveillance encompassing large and varied patient populations is crucial for patient safety. EHRs contain a comprehensive amount of clinical information, which if harnessed properly, would be invaluable for pharmacovigilance. We have already demonstrated that we can accurately encode information in clinical reports using the NLP system MedLEE, and that we can accurately detect associations among clinical events using statistical methods that we developed. Therefore, this is an excellent opportunity to continue our research accomplishments and to advance the state of the art in pharmacovigilance.       More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map comprehensive clinical information in the EHR to codified data, and then statistical methods will be used to generate an extensive knowledge base of disease-symptom, disease-drug, drug-drug, and drug-symptom associations, which will be used to discover new ADEs. Additionally, we will develop methods to determine the correct sequence of drug, disease, and symptom events, which is critical for detecting ADEs. We will also develop methods to map fine-grained concepts into higher level concepts, which is important for optimizing the statistical methods. The performance of our discovery methods will be evaluated by testing the methods using drugs currently in use with known ADEs, and also by using historical rollback. We will first focus on discovery of short-term events using inpatient records, and then longer-term events using outpatient office visits.       This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods based on spontaneous reporting databases and administrative databases. We are confident the methods will be effective because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in this proposal presents an excellent chance to dramatically improve patient safety and reduce costs.               This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by developing effective methods for the discovery of new adverse drug events. The use of natural language processing on vast quantities of EHR records will result in the harnessing of comprehensive clinical information for this purpose, overcoming some of the limitations of current methods that rely on spontaneous reporting and administrative databases.","Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR",7870862,R01LM010016,"['Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Arts', 'Back', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Office Visits', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'administrative database', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'drug testing', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'statistics', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,172278,0.0493364498779268
"Investigating the generalizability of natural language processing of EMR data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The electronic medical record (EMR) offers impressive opportunities for increasing care quality, but challenges stand in the way of realizing this vision. For example, coded EMR data readily available for analysis typically are incomplete (due to the prevalence of free-text clinical notes in EMR implementations), and data from different EMRs are often incommensurate due to differences in standard vocabularies and system implementations. While informatics research has shown the feasibility of automatically coding specific aspects of clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP), challenges remain for translating these informatics developments into large-scale care quality assessments. To date, successful NLP solutions for automated quality assessment have tended to be applications that are specific to (a) the target problem or clinical focus, (b) the EMR data system, and (c) the person or team that implements the NLP solution. In this study, we propose to begin addressing the problem of implementation team specificity by developing, evaluating, and making freely available a generalizable NLP development tool suite. The tools will enable widespread adoption of NLP systems to extract and code data from free text clinical notes. The Knowledge Editing Toolkit will simplify development of problem-specific knowledge by helping the user define the rules, concepts, and terms that constitute a domain-specific knowledge module, thus allowing any informaticist to develop an NLP application. The NLP Application Validation Toolkit will allow rapid testing and evaluation of the application against a gold standard of independently-coded test records from any EMR. To evaluate the effects of the toolkits on NLP generalizability, we will have three clinical informaticists each build two NLP applications (for a total of six distinct applications). One of their applications will identify a constellation of common clinical signs or symptoms (e.g., ""persistent cough"") that are relatively discrete concepts using simple language terms for many different clinical purposes.

"Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance patient safety and reduce the cost of medical care by discovering novel adverse drug events (ADEs) through use of automated methods. We will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and data mining methodologies on vast quantities of clinical data in electronic health records (EHRs) to detect novel ADE signals.

We have already demonstrated that we can accurately encode information in clinical reports using the NLP system MedLEE, and that we can accurately detect associations among clinical events using statistical methods that we developed. Therefore, this is an excellent opportunity to continue our research accomplishments and to advance the state of the art in pharmacovigilance.       More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map comprehensive clinical information in the EHR to codified data, and then statistical methods will be used to generate an extensive knowledge base of disease-symptom, disease-drug, drug-drug, and drug-symptom associations, which will be used to discover new ADEs. Additionally, we will develop methods to determine the correct sequence of drug, disease, and symptom events, which is critical for detecting ADEs. We will also develop methods to map fine-grained concepts into higher level concepts, which is important for optimizing the statistical methods.

"Investigating the generalizability of natural language processing of EMR data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The electronic medical record (EMR) offers impressive opportunities for increasing care quality, but challenges stand in the way of realizing this vision. For example, coded EMR data readily available for analysis typically are incomplete (due to the prevalence of free-text clinical notes in EMR implementations), and data from different EMRs are often incommensurate due to differences in standard vocabularies and system implementations. While informatics research has shown the feasibility of automatically coding specific aspects of clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP), challenges remain for translating these informatics developments into large-scale care quality assessments. To date, successful NLP solutions for automated quality assessment have tended to be applications that are specific to (a) the target problem or clinical focus, (b) the EMR data system, and (c) the person or team that implements the NLP solution. In this study, we propose to begin addressing the problem of implementation team specificity by developing, evaluating, and making freely available a generalizable NLP development tool suite. The tools will enable widespread adoption of NLP systems to extract and code data from free text clinical notes. The Knowledge Editing Toolkit will simplify development of problem-specific knowledge by helping the user define the rules, concepts, and terms that constitute a domain-specific knowledge module, thus allowing any informaticist to develop an NLP application. The NLP Application Validation Toolkit will allow rapid testing and evaluation of the application against a gold standard of independently-coded test records from any EMR. To evaluate the effects of the toolkits on NLP generalizability, we will have three clinical informaticists each build two NLP applications (for a total of six distinct applications). One of their applications will identify a constellation of common clinical signs or symptoms (e.g., ""persistent cough"") that are relatively discrete concepts using simple language terms for many different clinical purposes. Their second application will assess behavioral counseling (e.g., ""alcohol counseling""), which uses complex language constructs for dedicated clinical purposes. We will describe and evaluate the accuracy of the solutions against independently coded test sets of medical records. We will quantify and compare the difficulty of creating these solutions as measured by the time, number of iterations required to build the applications, and the number of concepts and rules employed, as well as analyze variability in content and accuracy of the solutions created. In addition, we will use qualitative techniques to assess the ease of using the development tools; the difficulty in learning the tools; and specific types of problems, limitations, and bugs encountered.

"Using medical records repositories to improve the alert system design    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Rapid and accurate alerting of concerning patient events and conditions remains an important problem in clinical practice. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into the monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming and costly to extract and codify such knowledge; hence such systems are typically built to cover only very specific conditions. In addition, it is difficult for an expert to foresee the performance of the deployed systems and their potential drawbacks, especially their false alarm rates. It is not uncommon that computer alerting systems are discarded or must undergo multiple costly modification cycles before they reach clinically acceptable levels of performance.    Electronic health record (EHR) repositories today provide an opportunity to test various theories and develop new computational solutions to various clinical problems. The objective of this project is to investigate methods for using the data in such repositories to assist in the development of alerting systems. The project goals include the building of an evidence-driven framework for the evaluation and optimization of alerting systems with the help of past data. The framework will be able to provide early feedback and future performance estimates of an alerting system before it is deployed, which is anticipated to decrease the expert effort required to design such a system and lead to a shorter alerting system design cycle. The evidence-driven framework will be tested and evaluated on multiple clinical conditions and compared to the performance of alerting rules currently deployed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). The project investigators consist of a multidisciplinary team with expertise in rule-based alerting in the hospital setting, clinical pharmacy, laboratory medicine, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, and knowledge based systems.           Project Narrative: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors by sending computer-based reminders and alerts to clinicians. This project investigates a novel combination of past patient data stored in electronic form and statistical machine-learning methods to help develop and refine computer-based alerts, which are expected to improve healthcare quality and reduce costs.",Using medical records repositories to improve the alert system design,7784403,R01LM010019,"['Amiodarone', 'Archives', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expert Opinion', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heparin', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Information Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physicians', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'evaluation/testing', 'flexibility', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2009,370642,0.02625625000747358
"An NLP Approach to Generating Patient Record Summaries :  The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the manner in which physicians access, process and marshal medical information by providing them with an automatically generated, comprehensive, and up-to date summary of the information appearing in a patient record. At the point of patient care, physicians must often rapidly process a potentially overwhelming quantity of information pertaining to a patient. Failure to do so effectively may lead to provision of suboptimal care. Some electronic health record systems provide an automatically produced “cover sheet” geared to help physicians with a broad overview of a given patient, but the information is derived from the structured data fields in the patient record, ignoring the valuable narrative text entered by clinicians over time. We are building upon our prior work in summarization and natural language processing and leveraging our expertise in cognitive research studying information needs and decision making of clinicians to build a patient record summarizer that gathers information narrative (unstructured) as well as structured parts in the record. We focus on producing a summary for patients with kidney disease, as they often have a complex medical history with numerous conditions, procedures and medications. Providing a holistic, up-to-date summary of their chart would prove valuable to physicians in general and nephrologists in particular. The following three aims will be carried out: (1) conduct a formative study to determine how physicians prioritize and mentally represent relevant information when reviewing a patient chart; (2) create a set of automated methods to select salient pieces of information in the patient record and organize them into a coherent summary; and (3) evaluate the efficacy, efficiency and physician-user satisfaction associated with the use of the summarizer. A primary strength of this proposal is that we are addressing the problem of information overload, a bottleneck in the use of electronic health records, and evaluate the impact of our solution on clinicians’ actions and patients’ health outcomes. Furthermore, we propose to use novel natural language processing, knowledge-based and data mining methods to extract and organize salient information. Finally, we contribute to informatics research by extending the electronic health record functionalities to go beyond a simple documentation-entry system towards a useful reference and decision-making tool for physicians  Project Narrative We propose to design an automatically generated, comprehensive, and up-to-date summary of the information appearing in a patient record.

"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS.

"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text.

"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports.

"Integrated discovery and hypothesis testing of new associations in rare diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rare diseases are studied in isolated laboratories, forgotten by main stream pharmacological companies, and considered almost academic curiosities. Finding variables that correlate/cause rare diseases (a condition is rare when it affects less than 1 person per 2,000) is a difficult task. The low number of cases and the sparse nature of the reports make it difficult to obtain significant/meaningful statistical results. There are two ways to avoid these problems. The first is to integrate reported cases and associations to generate enough statistical power. The second way is to have an independent data set, big enough to cover rare cases. Each of the two methods has intrinsic problems. For instance, the search in the literature puts together different studies, each of them with their own biases in population, methodology and objectives. On the other hand, blind searches for associations in big databases introduce a large number of false positives due to multiple hypothesis testing.       These problems could be avoided by developing innovative methods that allow the integration of information and methodologies in the literature and longitudinal databases. To achieve this goal, we propose a team that combines expertise in natural language processing systems (Carol Friedman), electronic health records (George Hripcsak), statistics in combined databases and computational virology (Raul Rabadan). This team will generate an interdisciplinary approach to mine and integrate the literature and the dataset collected at Columbia/New York Presbyterian hospital. Identifying unusual correlations in rare diseases is the first step to understanding the origin of the diseases and to finding a cure for them. We hypothesize that we will develop effective methods aimed at improving our understanding of rare diseases by combining hypothesis testing and hypothesis discovery, and by integrating information from the literature and from the patient record to obtain increased statistical power. This will involve using natural language processing and statistical methods to mine both the literature and the electronic health record (EHR).           Project Narrative We will test reported associations in rare diseases and discover new ones by integrating information from the literature and from Electronic Health Records in hospitals.",Integrated discovery and hypothesis testing of new associations in rare diseases,7727710,R01LM010140,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Case Study', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hospitals', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Informatics', 'Information Theory', 'Kaposi Sarcoma', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Liver diseases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Rare Diseases', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Transplantation', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'blind', 'data mining', 'forgetting', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'longitudinal database', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'repository', 'research study', 'statistics', 'text searching', 'tool', 'virology', 'web site']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,533007,0.01498943942596698
"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening. The ultimate goal is to accelerate scientific discovery of more effective treatments for illness.",Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data,7653874,R01LM009886,"['Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Drug Formulations', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'eligible participant', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'novel', 'repository', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,357875,0.00795350699336474

"Online Social Networking as an Alternative Information Source for Clinical Resear    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical trials and patient records have been the main information sources for clinical research. While well- designed clinical trials can produce high quality data, they are generally very expensive and time consuming. Prior studies have also shown that patients enrolled in clinical trials are not necessarily representative of the general patient population. Chart reviews, which rely on the patient records, avoid some of the drawbacks of the clinical trials approach. Although chart review studies are more labor intensive, new developments in structured data entry and natural language processing (NLP) are helping to automate the process. However, studies which use chart reviews are limited by the accuracy and completeness of the data in the records.       In the past decade, online social networks have grown exponentially. Some health-focused social network sites have attracted large numbers of users and begun accumulating large quantities of detailed clinical information. The PatientsLikeMe site, for instance, has about 3,200 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients worldwide, and includes about 5% of the ALS population in the US. Information gathered by online social networks is primarily intended for patients to share with each other. Such information has also begun to attract the attention of medical researchers.[3, 4]       Because using information from online social networks for medical research is a fairly new phenomenon, the value and limitation of this type of information source have not been systematically examined. To do so, we propose to conduct a comparison study of patient-contributed information from PatientsLikeMe and records from a large medical record data repository - the Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) of the Partners Healthcare Systems. The proposed study will focus on ALS, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). The general goal is to explore how the medical record and online networking data differ, and if and how online networking data could complement the medical record data. The specific aims are:    1) Extract symptom and treatment information from the two different data sources.    2) Compare the prevalence of symptoms and treatments from the two information sources and analyze the difference.    3) Extract treatment response of prescription medications from PatientsLikeMe and analyze the confounding effect of the misunderstanding of medication indication.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will investigate an emerging data source for clinical research: online social network. This data source may complement and supplement the data from clinical trials and medical records, with a unique emphasis on patients' experience and perspectives.           The proposed project will investigate an emerging data source for clinical research: online social network.

"Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The goals of our project are as follows:     1. Create a corpus of temporally annotated data. Under the supervision of our consultants Dr. Frank Sacks, Dr. Vincent Carey, and two Registered Nurses, we will create a gold-standard annotation of events and temporal information within patient narratives from de- identified Electronic Health Record data using the CLEF and TimeML guidelines. We will use the framework of the Brandeis Annotation Tool, a system we have designed to facilitate the quick construction of accurately annotated corpora against a specified guideline. Extensions to the current event library and lexicon with medical event references will be made during the annotation process, under the guidance of the Registered Nurses.          2. Adapt the TARSQI Toolkit (TTK) to targeted temporal properties and relations in the EHR domain. We will use the TARSQI toolkit, a robust set of temporal processing algorithms we have designed for parsing natural language text, to automatically annotate the events and temporal information in EHR data. Combined with the Brandeis AcroMed Medical Abbreviation Server and those terms introduced in part 1, we will employ the Specialist Lexicon and other medical resources to extend the toolkit capabilities for recognizing and interpreting medical event information. Algorithms for identifying events, temporal expressions, and event anchorings and orderings will be trained against the gold standard created in Aim 1, and tested against held-out data.     3. Create a cross-document temporal database of medical events. Using the recognition algorithms introduced in Aim 2, we will create a searchable, temporally ordered database of medical events such as diseases, symptoms, surgeries/interventions, and test results. Events referred to multiple times in the data will be merged using a constraint- satisfaction analysis in order to create a more coherent narrative for a single patient over multiple records.           Project Narrative It is becoming increasingly common for medical researchers to use Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as a primary source of data for researching correlations between various medical issues and concepts. However, EHRs typically contain unstructured text, making them difficult to mine.

"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs.

"Increasing Clinical Trial Enrollment: A Semi-Automated Patient Centered Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application. The study design is prospective observational study. Scope is limited to cancer patients. There are three specific aims for this project. The first aim is to identify concepts that overlap between the electronic medical record's (EMR) clinical notes and the free text of clinical trial announcements. The PI will use the concepts to develop mapping frames that connect concepts in the text of trial announcements to those found in clinical notes in the medical record. When he has the mapping frames he will build the NLP module for the application. In the software development work he will utilize as many publicly available software components as possible. He will experiment with UIMA, GATE, MetaMap, Stanford Parser, NegEx algorithm and others. The PI will develop the tool around the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System knowledgebase. He will use Java for programming. The second aim is to create an algorithm that automatically generates questions to request information directly from the patient if the information is not available or accessible in the records. The third aim is to evaluate the in-vitro, laboratory performance of the application. For performance evaluation purposes the PI will recruit cancer care specialists to generate the gold standard lists of eligible clinical trials for study patients. He will publicly release the developed code at the end of the grant period. This K99/R00 project will serve the foundation for future R01 grant applications. The PI is fully committed to become faculty in the Clinical Research Informatics domain with a specialization in biomedical NLP. The support of the K99/R00 grant will enable him to acquire substantial formal training in Computational Linguistics while contributing to the body of knowledge of the Clinical Research Informatics field. The five-year grant support will ensure success in his endeavor. The proposed work is highly significant because the dismal clinical trial accrual rates (2-4 % nationally) hampers timely development of new drugs. In addition, studies show that physicians have statistically significant bias against elderly and minority patients to invite participation in clinical trials. The proposed project is synergistic with physician-centered efforts but the goal is to provide individualized, EMR based clinical trial recommendations directly to the patients. The results of this research will empower the patients and elevate their role in the decision making process.           Relevance The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application.

"Early Warning Method and Technologies for Improving Cancer Care and Targeted Inte    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substantial evidence gathered over the last 50 years shows that adherence poses a crucial barrier to effective treatment and survival for cancer and other chronic diseases. At least one in five cancer patients do not adhere to treatment regimen, with much higher disease-specific rates. This non-adherence, or deviation from the recommended and expected clinical path, can dramatically increase costs of care, hospitalizations, adverse outcomes and the chance of preventable death. What causes non-adherence to treatment regimens is currently not rigorously understood. Current adherence research methods largely rely on survey instruments that have limited scale and scope, provide lagging information that inhibits timely intervention, and offer little actionable information to help patients to adhere to their care regimens. Further, the nature and timing of intervention to improve adherence have not been researched in depth. With continuous changes in cancer treatment, newer proactive approaches and methods for surveillance of patient adherence and targeted interventions are needed. In this project, we examine the feasibility and validity of a novel approach that uses a computational model to glean fine-grained attributes of cancer patients from standard electronic medical records. Our preliminary work has shown that electronic records to contain free-form text describing patient sentiment, vitals, medical condition, side effects, social history and family status written by physicians, nurses, medical assistants, and other staff during every visit encounter. With the steady adoption of electronic medical records by clinicians across the US (currently 29% and rising at 12% per year), clinical notes found in electronic records offer a tantalizing source of insight into patient adherence and behavior. Current adherence research has not tapped this rich source of data, even though many disciplines including biomedical informatics have employed natural language processing and text-mining techniques to glean patterns in semi- structured biomedical data. We aim to employ similar but novel, scalable computational models to glean a rich set of risk factors for patient non-adherence from 1 million patient encounter records, corresponding to 24,050 patients that span a 10 year time-horizon. Our objectives are to estimate the risk of a patient's ability to adhere to a prescribed regimen and enable targeted and timely interventions by using computational analysis of unstructured and structured fields in standard clinical documentation.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We aim to show the feasibility of an early warning system that detects and estimates a cancer patient's risk of non-adherence to treatment regimens by analyzing unstructured text in standard medical records. This technology has tremendous relevance for improved quality of care, proactive management of chronic diseases and patient safety.                        Project Narrative We aim to show the feasibility of an early warning system that detects and estimates a cancer patient's risk of non-adherence to treatment regimens by analyzing unstructured text in standard medical records.

"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype.

"Translational refinement of adaptive communication system for locked-in patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proliferation of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology promises locked-in patients potential ways to communicate successfully. Most BCI systems either involve selection from among a set of simultaneously presented stimuli, requiring extensive control of the interface; or use binary stimulus selection mechanisms that fail to achieve high communication rates because of slow intent detection or a fixed (context independent) ordering of stimuli. We propose a new interface using binary selection of text input via rapid serial visual presentation of natural language components. Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from acquired neurological disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) and neurodevelopmental disorders (cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy) drive the proposed research. Four laboratories form an alliance for this translational research project: basic research (Erdogmus, engineering; Roark, computer science and natural language processing), and clinical research (Oken, neurology/neurophysiology; Fried-Oken, augmentative communication/neurogenic communication disorders). Our aims are (1) to develop an innovative EEG-based BCI that achieves increased communication rates with fewer errors and greater satisfaction for the target SSPI populations; (2) to iteratively refine the system in the laboratory with user feedback from healthy subjects and expert LIS users of marketed AAC systems; (3) to evaluate the performance of the system within the natural clinical settings of SSPI patients. The innovative BCI is the RSVP Keyboard with three essential features: (1) rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of linguistic components ranging from letters to words to phrases; (2) a detection mechanism that employs multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and/or other suitable response mechanisms that can reliably indicate the binary intent of the user and adapt based on individualized neurophysiologic data of the user; and (3) an open-vocabulary natural language model with a capability for accurate predictions of upcoming text. Theoretical framework is based on a solid Bayesian foundation; clinical usability is based on the WHO ICF (WHO, 2001) and an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) model of participation. Rigorous experimental scrutiny in both clinical laboratory and natural settings will be obtained with able-bodied subjects and SSPI patients. Measures of learning rate, speed of message production, error rate and user satisfaction for different iterations of the RSVP keyboard will be obtained using an hypothesis-driven crossover design for 36 healthy subjects, and alternating treatment randomization design for 40 patients with SSPI. Descriptions of the motor, cognitive, and language skills of LIS patients using the novel system in their natural environments will inform clinical guidelines and functional device adaptations to better individualize treatment for children and adults with SSPI. The collaborative nature of the proposed translational research is expected to yield new knowledge for both BCI development and clinical AAC use.    Relevance: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily care giving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The RSVP keyboard and proposed language models are innovative technological discoveries that are being applied to clinical augmentative communication tools so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care. The proposed project stresses the translation of basic computer science into clinical care, supporting the proposed NIH Roadmap and public health initiatives.              Public health relevance statement: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life.

"NLP Foundational Studies & Ontologies for Syndromic Surveillance from ED Reports    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Many NLP applications have been successfully developed to extract information from text. Most of the   applications have focused on identifying individual clinical conditions in textual records, which is the first step in making the conditions available to computerized applications. However, identifying individual instances of clinical conditions is not sufficient for many medical informatics tasks - the context surrounding the condition is crucial for integrating the information within the text to determine the clinical state of a patient. We propose to perform in-depth studies on NLP issues requiring knowledge of the context of clinical conditions in clinical records. We will focus our research by using syndromic surveillance from emergency department (ED) reports as a case study.      For this proposal, we will test the following hypothesis: An NLP system that indexes clinical concepts and integrates contextual information modifying the concepts can identify acute clinical conditions from ED reports as well as physicians can.      We will identify clinical concepts necessary for surveillance of seven syndromes, including respiratory,   gastrointestinal, neurological, rash, hemorrhagic, constitutional, and botulinic. To evaluate the hypothesis, we will perform the following specific aims:      Aim 1. Perform in-depth, foundational studies on four NLP topics to gain a deeper understanding of the      pertinent NLP research capabilities required for identification of acute clinical conditions from ED reports, including negation, uncertainty, temporal discrimination, and finding validation;      Aim 2. Apply the knowledge learned from the foundational studies to develop and evaluate an automated application for ED reports that will determine the values for clinical variables relevant to identifying patients with any of seven syndromes.      The research is innovative, because it will generate an in-depth study of multiple NLP topics crucial to   understanding a patient's clinical state from textual records and will focus on contextual understanding and analysis. The research will be guided by linguistic principles, by the semantics and discourse structure of ED reports, and by the application area of biosurveillance. Because we will develop research methods and tools that are customized to a particular domain, we will constrain the research space, which will provide direction and enhance the chance for success.

"Improving Outpatient Medication Lists Using Temporal Reasoning and Clinical Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accurate and complete medication lists are critical inputs to effective medication reconciliation to prevent medication prescribing and administration errors. Previous research aggregated structured medication data form multiple sources to generate and maintain a reconciled medication list. Medications documented in clinical texts also need to be reconciled. However, most reconciliation methods currently have limited capability to process textual data and temporal information (e.g., dates, duration and status). Our goal is to pilot and test methodologies and applications in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and temporal reasoning to facilitate the use of electronic clinical texts in order to improve the ""correctness"" and ""completeness"" of medication lists. Clinic notes and free-text ""comments"" fields in medication lists in an ambulatory electronic medical record system will be considered in the study. An NLP system and a temporal reasoning system will be adapted to automatically extract medication and associated temporal information from clinical texts and encode the medications using a controlled terminology. Multiple knowledge bases will be used to develop a mechanism to represent the timing of medication use, detect the changes (e.g., active or inactive), and then to organize medications into appropriate groups (e.g., by ingredient or by status). The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed methods and tools in improving the process of medication   reconciliation will be assessed. Domain experts will serve as judges to assess the success of capturing, coding, and organizing the medications and temporal information and also to evaluate whether our methods are complementary to those currently used for medication management.           Accurate and complete medication information at the point of care is crucial for delivery of high-quality care and prevention of adverse events. Most previous studies aggregated structured medication data from EMR and CPOE (Computerized Physician Order Entry) systems to generate and maintain a reconciled medication list. However, medications in non-structured narrative sources (such as clinic notes and free-text comments) must also be reconciled. Structured data presented in a standard, predictable form can be easily processed by a computer. By contrast, narrative data does not have a well-defined structure, so processing such data is very challenging. Our goal is to pilot and test methodologies and applications in the fields of natural language processing (any system that manipulates text) and temporal reasoning (e.g., identifying the timing of medication use) to facilitate the use of electronic clinical texts in order to improve the ""correctness"" and ""completeness"" of medication lists.

"Data Structuring and Visualization System for Neuro-oncology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The medical record for a neuro-oncology patient is complex, consisting of typically a large number of both text and imaging data. It includes descriptions of prior observations, interpretations, and interventions which need to be integrated into decisions regarding current patient care. An appropriate review of a patient's medical record often requires that a physician review multiple clinical documents while mentally noting issues related to what the findings were, the chronology of events, spatial/temporal patterns of disease progression, the effects of interventions, and the possible causal lines of explanation of observed findings. Additionally, imaging data and imaging- derived conclusions are poorly integrated into patient care and management decisions. The physician also needs to filter out those pieces of information not related to the current clinical context of care. Given the time constraints, data complexity and data volume associated with chronic patient cases, an appropriate review of a patient's chart is in reality rarely performed. Additionally, the lack of tools for formalizing the representation of the accounts of current and prior cases impedes the development of clinical databases that can be ultimately used to learn patterns of disease.       This proposal addresses the development of a system for facilitating the review of clinical patient data intended to promote an orderly process of medical problem understanding and care. The specific aims of the proposal are summarized as follows: 1) Development of a backend tool to facilitate the structured representation of observations, events, and inferences stated within medical reports. 2) Development of an application interface for visualizing, navigating, and editing structured patient data. 3) Evaluation of the effectiveness of the application in the domain of neuro-oncology.       Relation to public health. If the goals of this proposal can be realized, neuro-oncologist should be able to more easily seek desired patient data and detect patterns of evidence as compared to the current mode of operation (HIS, RIS, PACS). The structuring tools should lead to improvements in the quality of clinical research databases.           Narrative Medical records for neuro-oncology patients are difficult to review due to volume and complexity of information. A novel system for partitioning data along the information axes of space, time, existence, and causality is proposed to improve navigation and assimilation of data within the medical record.",Data Structuring and Visualization System for Neuro-oncology,7567140,R01LM009961,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Assimilations', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Effectiveness', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Metric', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncologist', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'abstracting', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'open source', 'physical state', 'satisfaction', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2009,953185,0.016719380120384517
"POET: Consolidated, Comprehensive Clinical Text Preprocessing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       As electronic health records (EHRs) continue their expansion into clinical settings, there has been a corresponding increase in interest in mining the data they contain, both for research as well as for clinical decision support. Informaticists are increasingly studying ways to mine EHR textual content. This is an important trend, because there is a wealth of information contained in clinical text not represented anywhere else in the EHR. There is a low level text-as-data issue which presents a significant obstacle to the widespread use of available medical NLP systems: hand-typed clinical narratives in EHRs are usually ungrammatical; short or telegraphic in style; full of abbreviations, acronyms, and misspellings; formatted in a templated or pseudo-tabular form; and contain embedded non-text such as a list of laboratory values cut-and-pasted from elsewhere in the EHR. As we show in the Preliminary Studies Section, this makes high-level processing by popular tools like MedLEE and MetaMap effectively useless for all but a few ""clean"" document types like discharge summaries or consult reports (e.g., pathology or radiology reports). This in turn explains why there is so little published about what is certainly the preponderance of clinical texts, those that are not as well-behaved lexically and syntactically as a discharge summary.       In this application we distinguish clinical narratives (e.g., a progress note) from biomedical narratives (e.g., a PubMed abstract). We are interested in texts that arise in the clinical or research setting; texts that are composed by clinicians and researchers directly into a computer system. We propose to build and publish a tool called POET (Parsable Output Extracted from Text). POET will be designed to accept unstructured textual documents and return structured, linguistic equivalents that are, to the extent possible, parsable by higher-level NLP engines. POET will have an architecture is modular, extensible, and based on open-source platforms and sources (e.g., Java, Perl, UMLS, NegEx, the Stanford Parser, HL7 Clinical Document Architecture, caGRID, etc.). To implement POET, we will collect, program, and evaluate published as well as novel algorithms for: acronym/abbreviation resolution; spelling correction; template and pseudo-table re-writing; and removal of embedded non-text. To test POET we will use a large corpus of cross-discipline (e.g., medical, nursing, pharmacy, etc.) clinical note types, as well as the clinical research texts MedWatch reports and IRB adverse event reports. The development of POET will combine the best practices found in the literature and new research efforts as part of the project. To validate the fidelity of POET processing we plan a formal analysis of information loss and information gain pre- and post-process. To ensure broad access to the tools, POET will be released under an open-source license. Finally, we plan to assess the feasibility of offering POET as a Web service for remote processing.           Public Health Relevance This project attempts the construction of POET, a low-level preprocessing system for full text that can be used to open up large portions of the electronic health record (EHR) to high-level NLP systems. The potential public health implications are: 1) POET will allow the expansion of the use of well-proven clinical NLP systems  (currently limited to only a few document types found in the EHR) to the entire  clinical text record; with the entirety of the clinical record accessible to NLP,  serious and realistic attempts at real-time clinical text surveillance can be  mounted to improve patient safety and quality of care; 2) POET will be made available through open source distribution and other means  to encourage the practical deployment of innovative decision support systems  using large healthcare network EHRs across the country; 3) POET meets an important translational public health informatics need by solving  persistent low-level barriers to effective data mining of clinical marriages in the  EHR.

"Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        	Epidemiologic analyses of health care data can provide critical evidence on the effectiveness and safety of therapeutics. This is particularly vital during the transition from the point of regulatory approval through the early marketing of new drugs, a time when physicians, regulators and payers are all struggling with incomplete data. Health plans pay for these drugs without knowing how their effectiveness and safety compares with established alternatives, as new compounds are tested against placebos rather than active agents, and tested only in selected patients. Non-randomized studies in large healthcare databases can provide fast and less costly evidence on drug effects. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a small number of investigator-specified confounders often fail and may produce biased results.     We propose and have preliminary evidence that employing modern medical informatics algorithms that structure and search databases to empirically identify thousands of new covariates. These will then enter established propensity score-based models and so make far more effective use of the information contained in health care databases and electronic medical records (EMRs), resulting in more valid causal interpretations of treatment effects. We will:    - Develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims and EMR databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. The performance of these approaches will be evaluated in 6 example studies encompassing recent drug safety and comparative effectiveness problems, and will be implemented in multiple large claims databases supplemented by such data as lab values and EMR information in subgroups.    -- Develop novel methods for confounding adjustment based on textual information found in EMRs.    -- Expand the newly developed mining algorithms into a framework that integrates distributed database networks with uneven information content, similar to the Sentinel Network recently initiated by FDA.                            This project is likely to produce groundbreaking results at the interface of medicine, biomedical informatics, and epidemiologic methods. After completion of this project a library of documented and validated algorithms will be available to significantly improve confounder control in a range of healthcare databases. The theoretical foundation and the ready-to-use algorithms will likely lead to a fundamental shift in how databases contribute to the fast and accurate assessment of newly-marketed medications.            Large healthcare databases are used to assess the safety and effectiveness of drugs. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a limited number of investigator-specific covariates often fail to produce unbiased results. We will develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims data and electronic medical records databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. This will result in improved causal inference on the comparative safety and effectiveness of newly marketed medications that is both less susceptible to investigator omissions and faster than conventional approaches.",Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects,7767483,R01LM010213,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Distributed Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Head', 'Health Planning', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Marketing', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Scoring Method', 'Sentinel', 'Severity of illness', 'Solid', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'data mining', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lectures', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'routine care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2009,314000,-0.008267808452077823
"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ongoing goal of our project, ""Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,"" is to develop and apply methods to exploit electronic medical record data for decision support, with an emphasis on narrative data. Since the inception of our project as an R29 in 1994, we have been developing methods for preparing raw electronic medical record data, applying and evaluating natural language processing, developing data mining techniques including machine learning, and putting the results to use for clinical care and research.       In this competing continuation, we propose to address the temporal information in the electronic medical record and to apply natural language processing and temporal processing to the task of syndromic surveillance in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH).       We have begun work on a temporal processing system. It extracts temporal assertions stated in narrative reports, uses the MedLEE natural language processor to parse the non-temporal information, infers implicit temporal assertions based on a knowledge base, and produces the information in the form of a simple temporal constraint satisfaction problem. The latter can be used to answer questions about the time of events and the temporal relation between pairs of events. We propose to complete the system, expand the knowledge base, speed computation, address the uncertainty of temporal assertions, incorporate temporal information from structured data, and evaluate the system.       NYC DOHMH has a mature syndromic surveillance system that watches over almost eight million persons, and it has as-yet unexploited data sources in the form of narrative and structured electronic medical records. We propose to apply natural language processing and our proposed temporal processing to convert the data to a form appropriate for surveillance. We will evaluate the incremental benefit of structured data, narrative data, and temporally processed narrative data.           n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,7495030,R01LM006910,"['Address', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Persons', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'data mining', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'satisfaction', 'syndromic surveillance']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2008,338600,0.047804324770905106
"Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Reports    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Analyzing and processing free-text medical reports for data mining and clinical data interchange is one of the most challenging problems in medical informatics, yet it is crucial for continued research advances and improvements in clinical care. Natural language processing (NLP) is an important enabling technology, but has been held back because it is difficult to understand human language, since it requires extensive domain knowledge. In Phase I, we developed new statistical and machine learning methods that apply domain specific knowledge to the semantic analysis of free-text radiology reports. The methods enabled the creation of two new prototype applications - a SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine--Clinical Terms) coding service called SnomedCoder, and a text mining tool for analyzing a large corpus of medical reports, called DataMiner. In Phase II, we will accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Improve the semantic extraction methods developed in Phase I, 2) Expand the semantic knowledge base and classify at least two million new unique sentences from multiple medical institutions, 3) Provide a SNOMED CT auto coding service (alpha service) to participating Indiana Health Information Exchange hospitals, and 4) Build a commercial version of the DataMiner software, and test its functionality using researchers at the Regenstrief Institute.       These scientific innovations will revolutionize the ability of health care researchers to analyze vast repositories of clinical information currently locked up in electronic medical records, and correlate this data with new biomedical discoveries in proteonomics and genomics. The ability to codify text rapidly will extend the potential for clinical decision support beyond its narrow base of numeric and structured medical data, and enable SNOMED CT to become a useful coding standard. Phase III will offer coding and data mining services to healthcare payers (both private and government), pharmaceuticals, and academic researchers. A key advantage of our approach over other NLP systems is that we attempt to codify all the information in the report and not just a limited subset, and insist on expert validation which provides a high degree of confidence in the accuracy of the coded data.Project Narrative           n/a",Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Reports,7394699,R44RR024929,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body of uterus', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Paper', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Speed', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Trees', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Validation', 'base', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'novel strategies', 'patient safety', 'prototype', 'repository', 'research and development', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCRR,"LOGICAL SEMANTICS, INC.",R44,2008,429955,0.015877683496977147
"Feasibility of a Natural Language Processing-based Dental Charting Application    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The absence of a flexible, robust, and accurate natural language interface is a significant barrier to the direct use of computer-based patient records by dental clinicians. While providing patient care, dentists, hygienists and assistants are handicapped in using a keyboard and mouse to interact with a computer, primarily because of infection control concerns. The objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a prototype dental charting system with a speech-driven interface that will allow the dentist to chart dental conditions using natural language. The system will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract the key concepts associated with 16 dental conditions from transcribed dental examinations. These concepts, coded using the standardized terminologies, would provide a structured summary of a patient's initial dental exam. The proposal has two aims: 1) evaluate the accuracy of speech recognition technology for clinical dental examinations; and 2) develop and evaluate an NLP application for mapping transcribed text to a structured dental chart. This proposal describes a new, exploratory and innovative research project that could radically impact the practice of dental charting. Expected outcomes for this proposal include: 1) an understanding of the accuracy of speech recognition for real-time dictated dental exams; and 2) NLP-based tools to automatically chart restorative and periodontal conditions for each tooth into a structured dental chart. This developmental work will provide a strong foundation for developing a chairside NLP-based dental charting application that would automatically generate a structured dental chart suitable for chairside decision support.          n/a",Feasibility of a Natural Language Processing-based Dental Charting Application,7478824,R21DE018158,"['Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Dental Dictionaries', 'Dental General Practice', 'Dental Hygienists', 'Dental Informatics', 'Dental Offices', 'Dental Records', 'Dentistry', 'Dentists', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Documentation', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Infection Control', 'Language', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Transcription', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Services', 'Speech', 'Speech Recognition Software', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'concept', 'dental structure', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handicapping condition', 'improved', 'innovation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'restoration', 'speech recognition', 'tool']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2008,177729,0.006289493353646398
"Investigating the generalizability of natural language processing of EMR data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The electronic medical record (EMR) offers impressive opportunities for increasing care quality, but challenges stand in the way of realizing this vision. For example, coded EMR data readily available for analysis typically are incomplete (due to the prevalence of free-text clinical notes in EMR implementations), and data from different EMRs are often incommensurate due to differences in standard vocabularies and system implementations. While informatics research has shown the feasibility of automatically coding specific aspects of clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP), challenges remain for translating these informatics developments into large-scale care quality assessments. To date, successful NLP solutions for automated quality assessment have tended to be applications that are specific to (a) the target problem or clinical focus, (b) the EMR data system, and (c) the person or team that implements the NLP solution. In this study, we propose to begin addressing the problem of implementation team specificity by developing, evaluating, and making freely available a generalizable NLP development tool suite. The tools will enable widespread adoption of NLP systems to extract and code data from free text clinical notes. The Knowledge Editing Toolkit will simplify development of problem-specific knowledge by helping the user define the rules, concepts, and terms that constitute a domain-specific knowledge module, thus allowing any informaticist to develop an NLP application. The NLP Application Validation Toolkit will allow rapid testing and evaluation of the application against a gold standard of independently-coded test records from any EMR. To evaluate the effects of the toolkits on NLP generalizability, we will have three clinical informaticists each build two NLP applications (for a total of six distinct applications). One of their applications will identify a constellation of common clinical signs or symptoms (e.g., ""persistent cough"") that are relatively discrete concepts using simple language terms for many different clinical purposes. Their second application will assess behavioral counseling (e.g., ""alcohol counseling""), which uses complex language constructs for dedicated clinical purposes. We will describe and evaluate the accuracy of the solutions against independently coded test sets of medical records. We will quantify and compare the difficulty of creating these solutions as measured by the time, number of iterations required to build the applications, and the number of concepts and rules employed, as well as analyze variability in content and accuracy of the solutions created. In addition, we will use qualitative techniques to assess the ease of using the development tools; the difficulty in learning the tools; and specific types of problems, limitations, and bugs encountered. Such an NLP development tool suite has the potential to allow simple, elegant, and reliably good NLP solutions regardless of the clinical problem domain or the person developing the solution.           n/a",Investigating the generalizability of natural language processing of EMR data,7529967,R21LM009728,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Architecture', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coughing', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Event', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Resources', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Information Technology', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Modification', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Purpose', 'Quality of Care', 'Records', 'Research', 'Running', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Vocabulary', 'care delivery', 'concept', 'cost', 'design', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'health care quality', 'stem', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development']",NLM,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2008,213300,0.06147805020815674
"Using Natural Language Processing to Monitor Product Claims Compliance for FDA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Linguastat, Inc. proposes to develop a means to automate the process of monitoring and identifying companies engaged in false advertising and deceptive practices in the marketing of drugs, dietary supplements, and/or food products. By leveraging state of the art approaches in computational linguistics such as Information Extraction and Natural Language Processing, it should be feasible, with some adaptation, to use this technology to: 1) automatically and continuously monitor the websites, TV transcripts, press releases and other electronic marketing text communications of tens of thousands of companies for various claims and product information 2) automatically ""red-flag"" instances in which claims have a high likelihood of potential harm to consumers, according to FDA priorities 3) automatically identify and extract the companies, products and claims embedded in electronic product information and electronic promotional materials to create a database easily searchable by the FDA and 4) automatically capture web-based or other electronic content for human review and store it as ""evidence."" Such automated technology would enable the FDA to significantly stretch its limited human resource to more effectively and comprehensively identify noncompliant product information, detect deceptive ads and other illegal practices, successfully prosecute offenders, and prevent harm to American consumers. For this Phase I SBIR project we propose to assess the feasibility of automated claims monitoring in three steps: In the first step, we will train information extraction and natural language processing algorithms to extract product marketing claims from text. In the second, step we will apply data mining and rules-based algorithms to assess which claims are likely to be non-compliant and merit further attention by FDA staff. In the third step, we will design and build a database of product claims that allows analysts to search, organize, and prioritize product claims based on the type of claim (e.g. what ailments does the product claim to treat), the type of product, and the likelihood of non- compliance. This technology will enable regulators and consumers to better monitor and detect cases of false, misleading, or deceptive advertising and product information. By enabling more effective enforcement of FDA regulations and giving consumers tools to make better buying decisions, the public health can be better protected by minimizing the impact of products that cause harm, give false hope, or entice consumers to forgo conventional remedies.          n/a",Using Natural Language Processing to Monitor Product Claims Compliance for FDA,7677599,R43FD003406,[' '],FDA,"LINGUASTAT, INC.",R43,2008,20000,-0.0014948805752891246
"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically. A component question type is a generic, simple question type that requires an answer strategy that is different from other component question types.       2) Develop new information retrieval models that integrate domain-specific knowledge for retrieving relevant documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       3) Extract relevant text, images, and videos from the retrieved documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       4) Integrate text, images, and videos, fusing information to generate a short and coherent multimedia summary.       5) Design a usability study to measure efficacy, accuracy and perceived ease of use of HERMES and to compare HERMES with other information systems.          n/a",HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li,7502749,R01LM009836,"['Area', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Edema', 'Erythema', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'New England', 'Numbers', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'design', 'foot', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'mecarzole', 'older men', 'patient oriented', 'response', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2008,352226,0.011337445978535284
"Evidence based anomaly detection in clinical databases.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medical errors and their timely identification remain an important problem in clinical practice. Electronic medical record repositories and electronic data processing offer an opportunity to identify such errors in time to prevent them or at least attenuate their harm.  Typical computer-based error detection methods rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that is incorporated into the monitoring and alerting systems. Alerting that is based on knowledge is generally reliable; however, it is time-consuming and costly to extract and codify such knowledge, and as a consequence such systems are relatively narrow in their scope.  We propose to develop and evaluate a data-based approach for detecting clinical outliers (anomalies) that is complementary to knowledge-based approaches. This new approach is based on comparing clinical actions, such as medications given and labs ordered, taken for the current patient to those actions taken for similar patients in the recent past, as recorded in a clinical database. If a clinical action for the current patient is highly unusual, then a cautionary alert is raised along with an explanation for why the action appears to be unusual. Key advantages of the new technique are that it works with minimal prior knowledge, and it may detect anomalies for which no rules have yet been written. Thus, this data-driven approach to clinical anomaly detection is expected to complement knowledge-based alerting methods. We propose to implement a data-driven anomaly detection method, and then evaluate it in a laboratory setting using retrospective data for the cohort of surgical cardiac patients.  The project investigators comprise a multidisciplinary team with expertise in rule-based alerting in a hospital setting, clinical pharmacy, laboratory medicine, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, knowledge based systems, and clinical data repositories.          n/a",Evidence based anomaly detection in clinical databases.,7385073,R21LM009102,"['Anticoagulants', 'Arts', 'Attenuated', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dose', 'Drops', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Flushing', 'General Population', 'Healthcare', 'Heparin', 'Hospitals', 'Imagery', 'Information Resources Management', 'Invasive', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physicians', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Practice Management', 'Procedures', 'Range', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'design', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'prophylactic', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2008,193536,0.025596088063683298
"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports.

"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors. We subscribe to a vision of Personalized Medicine in which genomic and other patient-specific information drives personalized, predictive, preemptive, and participatory health care, and VGER represents an important step in that direction.           n/a",Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project,7502672,U01HG004603,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Ethics', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Ethics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'concept', 'data modeling', 'egg', 'endophenotype', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rhythm', 'indexing', 'repository', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2008,1432331,0.03980435374933291

"NLP Foundational Studies & Ontologies for Syndromic Surveillance from ED Reports    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Many NLP applications have been successfully developed to extract information from text. Most of the   applications have focused on identifying individual clinical conditions in textual records, which is the first step in making the conditions available to computerized applications. However, identifying individual instances of clinical conditions is not sufficient for many medical informatics tasks - the context surrounding the condition is crucial for integrating the information within the text to determine the clinical state of a patient. We propose to perform in-depth studies on NLP issues requiring knowledge of the context of clinical conditions in clinical records. We will focus our research by using syndromic surveillance from emergency department (ED) reports as a case study.      For this proposal, we will test the following hypothesis: An NLP system that indexes clinical concepts and integrates contextual information modifying the concepts can identify acute clinical conditions from ED reports as well as physicians can.      We will identify clinical concepts necessary for surveillance of seven syndromes, including respiratory,   gastrointestinal, neurological, rash, hemorrhagic, constitutional, and botulinic. To evaluate the hypothesis, we will perform the following specific aims:      Aim 1. Perform in-depth, foundational studies on four NLP topics to gain a deeper understanding of the      pertinent NLP research capabilities required for identification of acute clinical conditions from ED reports, including negation, uncertainty, temporal discrimination, and finding validation;      Aim 2. Apply the knowledge learned from the foundational studies to develop and evaluate an automated application for ED reports that will determine the values for clinical variables relevant to identifying patients with any of seven syndromes.      The research is innovative, because it will generate an in-depth study of multiple NLP topics crucial to   understanding a patient's clinical state from textual records and will focus on contextual understanding and analysis. The research will be guided by linguistic principles, by the semantics and discourse structure of ED reports, and by the application area of biosurveillance. Because we will develop research methods and tools that are customized to a particular domain, we will constrain the research space, which will provide direction and enhance the chance for success. However, the methods and tools generated by this research should be extensible to other clinical report types and to other domain applications, because we will explicitly specify and study NLP concepts and relationships that are common to many application areas.             n/a",NLP Foundational Studies & Ontologies for Syndromic Surveillance from ED Reports,7469551,R01LM009427,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Area', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Condition', 'Constitutional', 'Depth', 'Detection', 'Discrimination', 'Exanthema', 'Exhibits', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Informatics Applications', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Semantics', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'computerized', 'concept', 'gastrointestinal', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'quality assurance', 'respiratory', 'success', 'syndromic surveillance', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2008,392337,0.044123078881908195
"POET: Consolidated, Comprehensive Clinical Text Preprocessing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       As electronic health records (EHRs) continue their expansion into clinical settings, there has been a corresponding increase in interest in mining the data they contain, both for research as well as for clinical decision support. Informaticists are increasingly studying ways to mine EHR textual content. This is an important trend, because there is a wealth of information contained in clinical text not represented anywhere else in the EHR. There is a low level text-as-data issue which presents a significant obstacle to the widespread use of available medical NLP systems: hand-typed clinical narratives in EHRs are usually ungrammatical; short or telegraphic in style; full of abbreviations, acronyms, and misspellings; formatted in a templated or pseudo-tabular form; and contain embedded non-text such as a list of laboratory values cut-and-pasted from elsewhere in the EHR. As we show in the Preliminary Studies Section, this makes high-level processing by popular tools like MedLEE and MetaMap effectively useless for all but a few ""clean"" document types like discharge summaries or consult reports (e.g., pathology or radiology reports). This in turn explains why there is so little published about what is certainly the preponderance of clinical texts, those that are not as well-behaved lexically and syntactically as a discharge summary.       In this application we distinguish clinical narratives (e.g., a progress note) from biomedical narratives (e.g., a PubMed abstract). We are interested in texts that arise in the clinical or research setting; texts that are composed by clinicians and researchers directly into a computer system. We propose to build and publish a tool called POET (Parsable Output Extracted from Text). POET will be designed to accept unstructured textual documents and return structured, linguistic equivalents that are, to the extent possible, parsable by higher-level NLP engines. POET will have an architecture is modular, extensible, and based on open-source platforms and sources (e.g., Java, Perl, UMLS, NegEx, the Stanford Parser, HL7 Clinical Document Architecture, caGRID, etc.). To implement POET, we will collect, program, and evaluate published as well as novel algorithms for: acronym/abbreviation resolution; spelling correction; template and pseudo-table re-writing; and removal of embedded non-text. To test POET we will use a large corpus of cross-discipline (e.g., medical, nursing, pharmacy, etc.) clinical note types, as well as the clinical research texts MedWatch reports and IRB adverse event reports. The development of POET will combine the best practices found in the literature and new research efforts as part of the project. To validate the fidelity of POET processing we plan a formal analysis of information loss and information gain pre- and post-process. To ensure broad access to the tools, POET will be released under an open-source license. Finally, we plan to assess the feasibility of offering POET as a Web service for remote processing.           Public Health Relevance This project attempts the construction of POET, a low-level preprocessing system for full text that can be used to open up large portions of the electronic health record (EHR) to high-level NLP systems. The potential public health implications are: 1) POET will allow the expansion of the use of well-proven clinical NLP systems  (currently limited to only a few document types found in the EHR) to the entire  clinical text record; with the entirety of the clinical record accessible to NLP,  serious and realistic attempts at real-time clinical text surveillance can be  mounted to improve patient safety and quality of care; 2) POET will be made available through open source distribution and other means  to encourage the practical deployment of innovative decision support systems  using large healthcare network EHRs across the country; 3) POET meets an important translational public health informatics need by solving  persistent low-level barriers to effective data mining of clinical marriages in the  EHR. The wider public health implications include promoting effective computerized decision support and data mining to improve both personal and public health outcomes.","POET: Consolidated, Comprehensive Clinical Text Preprocessing",7570254,R21LM009967,"['Abbreviations', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Body of uterus', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pharmacists', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Systems', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Hand', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Laboratories', 'Licensing', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Mind', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Output', 'Paste substance', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physical assessment', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Report (document)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'data mining', 'design', 'discrete data', 'interest', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'spelling', 'tool', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2008,169313,0.02946875948075513
"Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text emerging trend in computational linguistics is melding natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to help computers make sense of human-generated free text. The blending of these disciplines is relatively rare in biomedical inforrnatics. Past medical NLP/ML research work is biased heavily towards linguistic methods that attempt to reason about grammar and syntax aided by a domain-focal knowledge base (e.g., one for radiology or one for clinical pathology). The aim of the work proposed here takes a different tack: exploring the utility of a statistical approach to clinical NLP, one augmented by machine learning and concentrating on general progress notes from across multiple clinical domains. The specific clinical goal will be to identify adverse drug events described implicitly or explicitly in inpatient progress notes. Rather than relying on a narrow domain focus to provide enough context restriction to make text interpretation tractable, this approach will use statistical patterns in note author information (e.g., profession, note type, treating ward) and patient information (e.g., admit diagnosis, procedures performed, temporal note relationships) for context restriction. The research component of this proposal is divided into two categories: three small-scale projects designed to rapidly hone new skills developed under the training component, and a large-scale project that assesses the feasibility of cross-discipline clinical text analysis. n/a",Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text,6944955,F38LM008478,"['Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Inpatients', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Statistical Study', 'Text', 'Training', 'Work', 'Writing', 'design', 'experience', 'knowledge base', 'skills', 'syntax', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend', 'ward']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F38,2007,38768,0.012263438683053376
"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ongoing goal of our project, ""Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,"" is to develop and apply methods to exploit electronic medical record data for decision support, with an emphasis on narrative data. Since the inception of our project as an R29 in 1994, we have been developing methods for preparing raw electronic medical record data, applying and evaluating natural language processing, developing data mining techniques including machine learning, and putting the results to use for clinical care and research.       In this competing continuation, we propose to address the temporal information in the electronic medical record and to apply natural language processing and temporal processing to the task of syndromic surveillance in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH).       We have begun work on a temporal processing system. It extracts temporal assertions stated in narrative reports, uses the MedLEE natural language processor to parse the non-temporal information, infers implicit temporal assertions based on a knowledge base, and produces the information in the form of a simple temporal constraint satisfaction problem. The latter can be used to answer questions about the time of events and the temporal relation between pairs of events. We propose to complete the system, expand the knowledge base, speed computation, address the uncertainty of temporal assertions, incorporate temporal information from structured data, and evaluate the system.       NYC DOHMH has a mature syndromic surveillance system that watches over almost eight million persons, and it has as-yet unexploited data sources in the form of narrative and structured electronic medical records. We propose to apply natural language processing and our proposed temporal processing to convert the data to a form appropriate for surveillance. We will evaluate the incremental benefit of structured data, narrative data, and temporally processed narrative data.           n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,7288319,R01LM006910,"['Address', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Persons', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'data mining', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'satisfaction', 'syndromic surveillance']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,345833,0.047804324770905106
"Feasibility of a Natural Language Processing-based Dental Charting Application    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The absence of a flexible, robust, and accurate natural language interface is a significant barrier to the direct use of computer-based patient records by dental clinicians. While providing patient care, dentists, hygienists and assistants are handicapped in using a keyboard and mouse to interact with a computer, primarily because of infection control concerns. The objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a prototype dental charting system with a speech-driven interface that will allow the dentist to chart dental conditions using natural language. The system will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract the key concepts associated with 16 dental conditions from transcribed dental examinations. These concepts, coded using the standardized terminologies, would provide a structured summary of a patient's initial dental exam. The proposal has two aims: 1) evaluate the accuracy of speech recognition technology for clinical dental examinations; and 2) develop and evaluate an NLP application for mapping transcribed text to a structured dental chart. This proposal describes a new, exploratory and innovative research project that could radically impact the practice of dental charting. Expected outcomes for this proposal include: 1) an understanding of the accuracy of speech recognition for real-time dictated dental exams; and 2) NLP-based tools to automatically chart restorative and periodontal conditions for each tooth into a structured dental chart. This developmental work will provide a strong foundation for developing a chairside NLP-based dental charting application that would automatically generate a structured dental chart suitable for chairside decision support.          n/a",Feasibility of a Natural Language Processing-based Dental Charting Application,7305430,R21DE018158,"['Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Dental Dictionaries', 'Dental General Practice', 'Dental Hygienists', 'Dental Informatics', 'Dental Offices', 'Dental Records', 'Dentistry', 'Dentists', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Documentation', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Infection Control', 'Language', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Transcription', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Services', 'Speech', 'Speech Recognition Software', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'concept', 'dental structure', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handicapping condition', 'improved', 'innovation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'restoration', 'speech recognition', 'tool']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2007,229030,0.006289493353646398
"Using Natural Language Processing to Monitor Product Claims Compliance for FDA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Linguastat, Inc. proposes to develop a means to automate the process of monitoring and identifying companies engaged in false advertising and deceptive practices in the marketing of drugs, dietary supplements, and/or food products. By leveraging state of the art approaches in computational linguistics such as Information Extraction and Natural Language Processing, it should be feasible, with some adaptation, to use this technology to: 1) automatically and continuously monitor the websites, TV transcripts, press releases and other electronic marketing text communications of tens of thousands of companies for various claims and product information 2) automatically ""red-flag"" instances in which claims have a high likelihood of potential harm to consumers, according to FDA priorities 3) automatically identify and extract the companies, products and claims embedded in electronic product information and electronic promotional materials to create a database easily searchable by the FDA and 4) automatically capture web-based or other electronic content for human review and store it as ""evidence."" Such automated technology would enable the FDA to significantly stretch its limited human resource to more effectively and comprehensively identify noncompliant product information, detect deceptive ads and other illegal practices, successfully prosecute offenders, and prevent harm to American consumers. For this Phase I SBIR project we propose to assess the feasibility of automated claims monitoring in three steps: In the first step, we will train information extraction and natural language processing algorithms to extract product marketing claims from text. In the second, step we will apply data mining and rules-based algorithms to assess which claims are likely to be non-compliant and merit further attention by FDA staff. In the third step, we will design and build a database of product claims that allows analysts to search, organize, and prioritize product claims based on the type of claim (e.g. what ailments does the product claim to treat), the type of product, and the likelihood of non- compliance. This technology will enable regulators and consumers to better monitor and detect cases of false, misleading, or deceptive advertising and product information. By enabling more effective enforcement of FDA regulations and giving consumers tools to make better buying decisions, the public health can be better protected by minimizing the impact of products that cause harm, give false hope, or entice consumers to forgo conventional remedies.          n/a",Using Natural Language Processing to Monitor Product Claims Compliance for FDA,7326883,R43FD003406,[' '],FDA,"LINGUASTAT, INC.",R43,2007,99773,-0.0014948805752891246
"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically. A component question type is a generic, simple question type that requires an answer strategy that is different from other component question types.       2) Develop new information retrieval models that integrate domain-specific knowledge for retrieving relevant documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       3) Extract relevant text, images, and videos from the retrieved documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       4) Integrate text, images, and videos, fusing information to generate a short and coherent multimedia summary.       5) Design a usability study to measure efficacy, accuracy and perceived ease of use of HERMES and to compare HERMES with other information systems.          n/a",HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li,7380099,R01LM009836,"['Area', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Edema', 'Erythema', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'New England', 'Numbers', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'design', 'foot', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'mecarzole', 'older men', 'patient oriented', 'response', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2007,383550,0.011337445978535284
"Evidence based anomaly detection in clinical databases.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medical errors and their timely identification remain an important problem in clinical practice. Electronic medical record repositories and electronic data processing offer an opportunity to identify such errors in time to prevent them or at least attenuate their harm.  Typical computer-based error detection methods rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that is incorporated into the monitoring and alerting systems. Alerting that is based on knowledge is generally reliable; however, it is time-consuming and costly to extract and codify such knowledge, and as a consequence such systems are relatively narrow in their scope.  We propose to develop and evaluate a data-based approach for detecting clinical outliers (anomalies) that is complementary to knowledge-based approaches. This new approach is based on comparing clinical actions, such as medications given and labs ordered, taken for the current patient to those actions taken for similar patients in the recent past, as recorded in a clinical database. If a clinical action for the current patient is highly unusual, then a cautionary alert is raised along with an explanation for why the action appears to be unusual. Key advantages of the new technique are that it works with minimal prior knowledge, and it may detect anomalies for which no rules have yet been written. Thus, this data-driven approach to clinical anomaly detection is expected to complement knowledge-based alerting methods. We propose to implement a data-driven anomaly detection method, and then evaluate it in a laboratory setting using retrospective data for the cohort of surgical cardiac patients.

"Automated Detection of Medical Errors DESCRIPTION:    The long-term goal of this proposal is to use the electronic medical record, including narrative text, to understand and encode the process of care for individual patients in order to improve patient safety.   Achieving this goal has the potential to help detect adverse events, and to differentiate medical errors from appropriately tailored care. The specific aims for this proposal are as follows: 1) To understand and encode the process of care for individual patients using data in the electronic medical record, including narrative text.   2) To use a more detailed understanding of patients' processes of care to improve automated adverse event detection. 3) To match processes of care for individual patients against accepted care pathways in order to identify discrepancies. We will capitalize on three core technologies that are in active use by clinicians and researchers in our busy clinical setting: 1) a Web-based clinical information system and its associated clinical data repository (WebCIS), 2) a full medical language parser (MedLEE), and 3) a semi-structured, electronic physician documentation system built by the applicant specifically to support this project (eNote).   Methods will include evaluating the performance (sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value) of our system, DETER+MINE (DETecting ERrors Mining Narrative Electronically), to model the care process and detect adverse events and pathway deviations. We will utilize explicit process criteria and manual, retrospective chart review as a gold standard.   This research is intended to provide proof of concept that combining natural language processing of clinical narrative with traditional sources of coded data is required for effective screening with automated defection systems. This approach has the potential to impact significantly on our ability to detect and investigate medical errors, adverse medical events, and pathway deviations by reducing reliance on costly and slow manual chart reviews. n/a",Automated Detection of Medical Errors,7282343,K22LM008805,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Applications Grants', 'Caring', 'Causations', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Language', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Negligence', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Range', 'Recommendation', 'Reliance', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source Code', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States', 'base', 'computerized', 'concept', 'experience', 'improved', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K22,2007,135000,0.03204266547481784

"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,7249382,R01EB000362,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Computer Architectures', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Geographic Locations', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Information Management', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Link', 'Management Information Systems', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Metric', 'Multimedia', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Series', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'United States', 'Urology', 'Visit', 'base', 'concept', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'peer', 'point of care', 'portability', 'research clinical testing', 'urologic', 'usability']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2007,517331,0.05775274129762711
"A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Consultation with appropriate specialists improves the quality of healthcare, particularly in patients with complicated cases or chronic illnesses. And for the majority of such patients, specialists use imaging studies (e.g., MR, CT) to objectively document the disease process (e.g., a cancer patient on chemotherapy). However, specialists are generally not available in all communities, tending to be concentrated in academic/specialty centers. Thus, to facilitate the routine use of teleconsultations for patients when specialists are not locally present: 1) the images captured to document the patient's condition must be incorporated into the medical record to enable proper review; and 2) the remote consultant should only receive pertinent parts of the medical record to streamline the consultation process. This proposal is focused on developing and testing a ""context-sensitive"" telehealth infrastructure based on: 1) automated incorporation of clinical context (patient presentation and referring physician hypothesis) to focus the consultation process; 2) a knowledge-base derived from data mining of natural language processing (NLP) results, mapping patient presentation to select an appropriate imaging study based on anatomical region and imaging parameters; and 3) automated selection of key anatomical structures in the acquired imaging study through the use of a contrast-customizable atlas and rigid body/deformable registration algorithms. Collectively, these technologies will allow context-sensitive, automated summarization of medical records for telehealth in a real-world environment. The proposed technologies will be implemented for neurological and musculoskeletal domains, two areas that are MR imaging intensive.      Technical evaluation will be performed with experts serving as the reference standard and will focus on measuring: 1) the accuracy of the corpus based, NLP-guided knowledge-base in selecting relevant anatomical structures; and 2) the accuracy of anatomical structure delineation using the customizable atlas registration methods. Clinical evaluation will be conducted in a real-world teleconsultation environment in a before/after study design using two performance metrics: 1) the time required for consultations; and 2) the effect on the quality of the consultations. n/a",A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure,7272822,R01EB002247,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Body of uterus', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Condition', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Eating', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Label', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Oncologist', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Slice', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teleconsultations', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Upper arm', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'health care quality', 'image registration', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'size', 'telehealth']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2007,394864,0.028301737676339648
"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors. We subscribe to a vision of Personalized Medicine in which genomic and other patient-specific information drives personalized, predictive, preemptive, and participatory health care, and VGER represents an important step in that direction.           n/a",Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project,7427367,U01HG004603,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Ethics', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Ethics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'concept', 'data modeling', 'egg', 'endophenotype', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rhythm', 'indexing', 'repository', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MED CTR,U01,2007,1463449,0.03980435374933291
"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4. Perform a series of GWA analyses in the GHC biorepository and linked biorepositories. 4a: Alzheimer's disease (AD). 4b: Carotid artery atherosclerotic disease (CAAD). 4c: Complications of statin use, including elevations of CPK and muscle pain.       Through cooperation with other investigators and the NHGRI, this work will facilitate development of policies and procedures to realize the incredible potential of EMR-linked biorepositories for GWA studies to improve understanding, prevention and treatment of chronic diseases and illnesses. Specific GWA research will allow us to explore both etiologic research (AD and CAAD progression) and pharmacogenetics (statin therapy).

"Biosurveillance Utilizing SNOMED-CT Based Natural Language Processing Bioterrorism remains a significant threat to our public health. Early identification of an increased rate of occurance of patient presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism is one important method to contain bioterror attacks and effect more rapid treatment of exposed individuals. Often presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism occur in significant numbers prior to the recognition that a bioterrorism related exposure has occurred. This presents an opportunity to capture and analyze signals from patient records. We propose to provide an abstraction of automated clinical information from the clinical record (section by section) that will be coded using SNOMED-CT which can serve as the substrate for surveillance data. We believe that this data (sets of codes by section of the clinical record) which holds the important and salient medical facts (codes) regarding the patients' presentation, findings, medications, allergies and co-morbidities could be abstracted from clinical records. In this study, we will analyze SNOMED-CT's ability to provide adequate content coverage for constellations of symptoms associated with exposures to agents of bioterrorism (i.e. Anthrax, Small Pox, Ricin, and Radiation exposure). Our method builds on the considerable body of research already available within our laboratory. We have been researching methods for codifying medical content using controlled medical vocabularies since 1987. For this study, we will employ the Mayo Vocabulary Server (MVS) developed in the Mayo Laboratory of Biomedical Informatics and has been used at Mayo, Johns Hopkins University and the VA medical centers all with great success. Our performanc2 of the MVS toolkit has been validated for diagnoses where we showed a sensitivity of 99.7% and a specificity of 97.9%.

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ongoing goal of our project, ""Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,"" is to develop and apply methods to exploit electronic medical record data for decision support, with an emphasis on narrative data. Since the inception of our project as an R29 in 1994, we have been developing methods for preparing raw electronic medical record data, applying and evaluating natural language processing, developing data mining techniques including machine learning, and putting the results to use for clinical care and research.       In this competing continuation, we propose to address the temporal information in the electronic medical record and to apply natural language processing and temporal processing to the task of syndromic surveillance in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH).       We have begun work on a temporal processing system. It extracts temporal assertions stated in narrative reports, uses the MedLEE natural language processor to parse the non-temporal information, infers implicit temporal assertions based on a knowledge base, and produces the information in the form of a simple temporal constraint satisfaction problem. The latter can be used to answer questions about the time of events and the temporal relation between pairs of events. We propose to complete the system, expand the knowledge base, speed computation, address the uncertainty of temporal assertions, incorporate temporal information from structured data, and evaluate the system.       NYC DOHMH has a mature syndromic surveillance system that watches over almost eight million persons, and it has as-yet unexploited data sources in the form of narrative and structured electronic medical records. We propose to apply natural language processing and our proposed temporal processing to convert the data to a form appropriate for surveillance. We will evaluate the incremental benefit of structured data, narrative data, and temporally processed narrative data.           n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,7147611,R01LM006910,"['artificial intelligence', 'classification', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'health care facility information system', 'human data', 'information system analysis', 'method development', 'vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,372106,0.047804324770905106

"Automated Detection of Medical Errors DESCRIPTION:    The long-term goal of this proposal is to use the electronic medical record, including narrative text, to understand and encode the process of care for individual patients in order to improve patient safety.   Achieving this goal has the potential to help detect adverse events, and to differentiate medical errors from appropriately tailored care. The specific aims for this proposal are as follows: 1) To understand and encode the process of care for individual patients using data in the electronic medical record, including narrative text.   2) To use a more detailed understanding of patients' processes of care to improve automated adverse event detection. 3) To match processes of care for individual patients against accepted care pathways in order to identify discrepancies. We will capitalize on three core technologies that are in active use by clinicians and researchers in our busy clinical setting: 1) a Web-based clinical information system and its associated clinical data repository (WebCIS), 2) a full medical language parser (MedLEE), and 3) a semi-structured, electronic physician documentation system built by the applicant specifically to support this project (eNote).   Methods will include evaluating the performance (sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value) of our system, DETER+MINE (DETecting ERrors Mining Narrative Electronically), to model the care process and detect adverse events and pathway deviations. We will utilize explicit process criteria and manual, retrospective chart review as a gold standard.   This research is intended to provide proof of concept that combining natural language processing of clinical narrative with traditional sources of coded data is required for effective screening with automated defection systems. This approach has the potential to impact significantly on our ability to detect and investigate medical errors, adverse medical events, and pathway deviations by reducing reliance on costly and slow manual chart reviews. n/a",Automated Detection of Medical Errors,7124706,K22LM008805,"['automated medical record system', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'health care quality', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'information retrieval', 'medical records', 'method development', 'patient care management', 'patient safety /medical error']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K22,2006,135000,0.03204266547481784
"A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Consultation with appropriate specialists improves the quality of healthcare, particularly in patients with complicated cases or chronic illnesses. And for the majority of such patients, specialists use imaging studies (e.g., MR, CT) to objectively document the disease process (e.g., a cancer patient on chemotherapy). However, specialists are generally not available in all communities, tending to be concentrated in academic/specialty centers. Thus, to facilitate the routine use of teleconsultations for patients when specialists are not locally present: 1) the images captured to document the patient's condition must be incorporated into the medical record to enable proper review; and 2) the remote consultant should only receive pertinent parts of the medical record to streamline the consultation process. This proposal is focused on developing and testing a ""context-sensitive"" telehealth infrastructure based on: 1) automated incorporation of clinical context (patient presentation and referring physician hypothesis) to focus the consultation process; 2) a knowledge-base derived from data mining of natural language processing (NLP) results, mapping patient presentation to select an appropriate imaging study based on anatomical region and imaging parameters; and 3) automated selection of key anatomical structures in the acquired imaging study through the use of a contrast-customizable atlas and rigid body/deformable registration algorithms. Collectively, these technologies will allow context-sensitive, automated summarization of medical records for telehealth in a real-world environment. The proposed technologies will be implemented for neurological and musculoskeletal domains, two areas that are MR imaging intensive.      Technical evaluation will be performed with experts serving as the reference standard and will focus on measuring: 1) the accuracy of the corpus based, NLP-guided knowledge-base in selecting relevant anatomical structures; and 2) the accuracy of anatomical structure delineation using the customizable atlas registration methods. Clinical evaluation will be conducted in a real-world teleconsultation environment in a before/after study design using two performance metrics: 1) the time required for consultations; and 2) the effect on the quality of the consultations. n/a",A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure,7115855,R01EB002247,"['anatomy', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer data analysis', 'computer graphics /printing', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'health care quality', 'health care referral /consultation', 'human data', 'image enhancement', 'image processing', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'musculoskeletal disorder', 'nervous system disorder', 'statistics /biometry', 'telemedicine']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2006,396341,0.028301737676339648
"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.  The availability of related compatible clinical and biomolecular NLP systems, provide an exceptional opportunity to pave the way for capture, integration and organization of phenotypic and genotypic data and knowledge that will be used to radically improve patient care. n/a",Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information,7110256,R01LM007659,"['cancer information system', 'clinical research', 'data collection', 'health science research', 'human data', 'informatics', 'library', 'medical records', 'molecular biology information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,478733,0.045917436357576766
"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,7083613,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information display', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'outcomes research', 'patient care management', 'performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2006,535569,0.05775274129762711
"Natural Language Processing for Respiratory Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator in biomedical informatics research. She will dedicate her career to developing and evaluating methodologies for improving the processes and outcomes of healthcare using data locked in textual documents. This career development award will provide her with initial support for achieving her career goals.      The applicant has three goals for her career development over the next three years. First, she will compare the performance of different machine learning techniques at detecting patients with a respiratory syndrome. The proposed research will expand the state-of-the-art syndromic surveillance capabilities by integrating findings, symptoms, and diseases described in textual medical records. The product of the first research goal will be a model for respiratory syndromic case detection for monitoring natural and bioterrorism induced respiratory outbreaks. Second, she will apply existing methods and develop new techniques for extracting clinical conditions required for respiratory case detection from emergency department notes, contributing new knowledge to the medical language processing field using sentence and report level models that account for uncertainty, negation, and temporal occurrence. The product of the second goal will be a better understanding of the information required for accurate detection of respiratory related conditions from text and useful tools for automatically extracting that information. Third, she will teach, promote, and facilitate the use of natural language processing in the biomedical informatics field.

"Biosurveillance/SNOMED-CT Natural Language Processing Bioterrorism remains a significant threat to our public health. Early identification of an increased rate of occurance of patient presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism is one important method to contain bioterror attacks and effect more rapid treatment of exposed individuals. Often presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism occur in significant numbers prior to the recognition that a bioterrorism related exposure has occurred. This presents an opportunity to capture and analyze signals from patient records. We propose to provide an abstraction of automated clinical information from the clinical record (section by section) that will be coded using SNOMED-CT which can serve as the substrate for surveillance data. We believe that this data (sets of codes by section of the clinical record) which holds the important and salient medical facts (codes) regarding the patients' presentation, findings, medications, allergies and co-morbidities could be abstracted from clinical records. In this study, we will analyze SNOMED-CT's ability to provide adequate content coverage for constellations of symptoms associated with exposures to agents of bioterrorism (i.e. Anthrax, Small Pox, Ricin, and Radiation exposure). Our method builds on the considerable body of research already available within our laboratory. We have been researching methods for codifying medical content using controlled medical vocabularies since 1987. For this study, we will employ the Mayo Vocabulary Server (MVS) developed in the Mayo Laboratory of Biomedical Informatics and has been used at Mayo, Johns Hopkins University and the VA medical centers all with great success. Our performanc2 of the MVS toolkit has been validated for diagnoses where we showed a sensitivity of 99.7% and a specificity of 97.9%. This proposal deals with practical issues that lead the way toward interoperable data.

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     With the advent of improved clinical information system products (e.g., ambulatory systems, order entry  systems), improved data entry technologies (e.g., speech recognition, text processing techniques), and  further adoption of data interchange standards, more institutions are generating electronic medical records, and these records will expand in breadth, depth, and degree of coding in the future. The records are used mainly for individual patient care, but exploiting the records for clinical research and quality functions has lagged behind. Major challenges include the wide range of complex data and missing and inaccurate data.      We propose to continue our work to develop and test methods to mine a clinical data repository. A  special emphasis will be to exploit the vast amount of information in the repository (latent associations and knowledge) and to use computer intensive techniques and advances in data representation and manipulation to better interpret what is in the database and to overcome the challenges of complex, missing, and inaccurate data. We hypothesize that data mining techniques can be applied to a repository to generate accurate clinical interpretations. We further hypothesize that associations latent in a clinically rich repository can be used to improve the classification of cases in that repository.      We aim to develop methods to prepare data for mining; to characterize the information in the clinical data repository; to develop similarity measures based on manipulation of natural language processor output and on information retrieval techniques; to apply nearest neighbor technique and case-based reasoning to improve classification; to develop a statistically based method to improve classification of cases with incomplete or inaccurate data; and to apply our methods to real clinical research questions and carry out additional data mining research.      The researchers in the Department of Medical Informatics at Columbia University are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (data mining, statistics, health data organization, health knowledge representation, natural language processing), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data. n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,6892934,R01LM006910,"['artificial intelligence', 'classification', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'health care facility information system', 'human data', 'information system analysis', 'method development', 'vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2005,384538,0.02444278725297686

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     With the advent of improved clinical information system products (e.g., ambulatory systems, order entry  systems), improved data entry technologies (e.g., speech recognition, text processing techniques), and  further adoption of data interchange standards, more institutions are generating electronic medical records, and these records will expand in breadth, depth, and degree of coding in the future. The records are used mainly for individual patient care, but exploiting the records for clinical research and quality functions has lagged behind. Major challenges include the wide range of complex data and missing and inaccurate data.      We propose to continue our work to develop and test methods to mine a clinical data repository. A  special emphasis will be to exploit the vast amount of information in the repository (latent associations and knowledge) and to use computer intensive techniques and advances in data representation and manipulation to better interpret what is in the database and to overcome the challenges of complex, missing, and inaccurate data. We hypothesize that data mining techniques can be applied to a repository to generate accurate clinical interpretations. We further hypothesize that associations latent in a clinically rich repository can be used to improve the classification of cases in that repository.      We aim to develop methods to prepare data for mining; to characterize the information in the clinical data repository; to develop similarity measures based on manipulation of natural language processor output and on information retrieval techniques; to apply nearest neighbor technique and case-based reasoning to improve classification; to develop a statistically based method to improve classification of cases with incomplete or inaccurate data; and to apply our methods to real clinical research questions and carry out additional data mining research.      The researchers in the Department of Medical Informatics at Columbia University are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (data mining, statistics, health data organization, health knowledge representation, natural language processing), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data. n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,6754395,R01LM006910,"['artificial intelligence', 'classification', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'health care facility information system', 'human data', 'information system analysis', 'method development', 'vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2004,380979,0.02444278725297686
"Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     An emerging trend in computational linguistics is melding natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to help computers make sense of human-generated free text. The blending of these disciplines is relatively rare in biomedical informatics. Past medical NLP/ML research work is biased heavily towards linguistic methods that attempt to reason about grammar and syntax aided by a domain-focal knowledge base (e.g., one for radiology or one for clinical pathology). The aim of the work proposed here takes a different tack: exploring the utility of a statistical approach to clinical NLP, one augmented by machine learning and concentrating on general progress notes from across multiple clinical domains. The specific clinical goal will be to identify adverse drug events described implicitly or explicitly in inpatient progress notes. Rather than relying on a narrow domain focus to provide enough context restriction to make text interpretation tractable, this approach will use statistical patterns in note author information (e.g., profession, note type, treating ward) and patient information (e.g., admit diagnosis, procedures performed, temporal note relationships) for context restriction. The research component of this proposal is divided into two categories: three small-scale projects designed to rapidly hone new skills developed under the training component, and a large-scale project that assesses the feasibility of cross-discipline clinical text analysis. n/a",Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text,6836781,F38LM008478,"['bioinformatics', 'clinical research', 'computational biology', 'human data', 'library', 'mathematical model', 'public health', 'statistics /biometry']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F38,2004,94545,0.012466359747669773
"Preserving Privacy in Medical Data Sets Privacy is a fundamental right and needs to be protected.  For health care related d information, there are regulations for disclosure.  These regulations were motivated by the public's concern of breaches of confidentiality that might result in discrimination.  The recent progress in electronic medical record technology, the Internet, and the genetic revolution, together with media reports on violations of privacy have generated increasing interest in this topic.  A common belief is that sensitive information is more easily available with the use of networked computers. Since total lack of disclosure is not realistic, current regulations require that the ""minimal amount"" of information be given to a certain party.  A thorough study on what constitutes ""minimal"" for particular types of applications and a ""usefulness index"" is lacking.  An exact quantification of the potential for privacy breach in de-identified or anonymized databases is also lacking.  Definition and quantification of these indices is important for decision-making.  As we demonstrate, de-identified data sets can still be used for inference and therefore may disclose sensitive information.  The use of machine learning methods to verify the remaining functional dependencies in a de- identified data set leads to better understanding of the possible inferences.  Anonymization techniques based on logic, statistics, database theory, and machine learning methods can help in the protection of privacy. We will formally define and study anonymity in databases, from a theoretical and a practical standpoint.  We will develop and implement algorithms to anonymize data sets that will be in accordance with the balance of anonymity and ""usefulness"" of the disclosed data sets.  We will also develop and implement algorithms to verify the anonymity of a given data set and indicate the type of records that are at highest risk for a privacy attack.

"A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Consultation with appropriate specialists improves the quality of healthcare, particularly in patients with complicated cases or chronic illnesses. And for the majority of such patients, specialists use imaging studies (e.g., MR, CT) to objectively document the disease process (e.g., a cancer patient on chemotherapy). However, specialists are generally not available in all communities, tending to be concentrated in academic/specialty centers. Thus, to facilitate the routine use of teleconsultations for patients when specialists are not locally present: 1) the images captured to document the patient's condition must be incorporated into the medical record to enable proper review; and 2) the remote consultant should only receive pertinent parts of the medical record to streamline the consultation process. This proposal is focused on developing and testing a ""context-sensitive"" telehealth infrastructure based on: 1) automated incorporation of clinical context (patient presentation and referring physician hypothesis) to focus the consultation process; 2) a knowledge-base derived from data mining of natural language processing (NLP) results, mapping patient presentation to select an appropriate imaging study based on anatomical region and imaging parameters; and 3) automated selection of key anatomical structures in the acquired imaging study through the use of a contrast-customizable atlas and rigid body/deformable registration algorithms. Collectively, these technologies will allow context-sensitive, automated summarization of medical records for telehealth in a real-world environment. The proposed technologies will be implemented for neurological and musculoskeletal domains, two areas that are MR imaging intensive.      Technical evaluation will be performed with experts serving as the reference standard and will focus on measuring: 1) the accuracy of the corpus based, NLP-guided knowledge-base in selecting relevant anatomical structures; and 2) the accuracy of anatomical structure delineation using the customizable atlas registration methods. Clinical evaluation will be conducted in a real-world teleconsultation environment in a before/after study design using two performance metrics: 1) the time required for consultations; and 2) the effect on the quality of the consultations. n/a",A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure,6802269,R01EB002247,"['anatomy', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer data analysis', 'computer graphics /printing', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'health care quality', 'health care referral /consultation', 'human data', 'image enhancement', 'image processing', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'musculoskeletal disorder', 'nervous system disorder', 'statistics /biometry', 'telemedicine']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2004,387825,0.028301737676339648
"Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Narrative information is vital to health care, because it enables physicians to synthesize the raw facts and provide a context and interpretation for them.  Electronic medical record systems contain a wealth of clinical data, but typically lack the clinical narrative found in paper records, e.g., the patient history and progress notes.  Numerous barriers prevent the timely acquisition of narrative data, and most computer systems are unable to use such information productively.  Current approaches offer a tradeoff, capture of rich clinical data that lacks structure (using transcription services or speech technology), versus entry of structured data that lacks flexibility and expressiveness (using template systems).  Natural language processing can integrate these approaches by allowing physicians full freedom of expression while producing structured documents that preserve the richness and enable further computer processing.   This proposal seeks to capture and structure narrative in the online medical record in order to improve entry time, completeness, information content and consistency of clinical documentation.  The specific aims of this proposal are:  1) Maintain the continuity of the medical record; a lengthy medical record requires significant time to review and digest.  Many facts from past narratives remain true in the present or persist with minor changes.  By automatically bringing these facts forward into the current narrative, the system can reduce the time to enter the document, and improve the completeness of documentation by maintaining continuity of what is known about a patient; 2) Integrate the medical record:  Electronic medical records contain a vast amount of data.  However, most of these data are raw facts.  By helping the physician to connect, interpret and summarize these facts, the system can improve the usefulness of the information in the record, and reduce the time to enter documents by performing some syntheses automatically; and 3) Harmonize the medical record; the multidisciplinary nature of health care creates the potential for the differing perspectives and interpretations in the medical record, and even contradictions.  By bringing possible discrepancies to the attention of the physician, the system can help resolve the inconsistencies.     n/a",Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record,6802698,R01LM007268,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human data', 'information systems', 'medical records', 'online computer', 'primary care physician', 'vocabulary']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2004,437194,0.0608207384959382
"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.  The availability of related compatible clinical and biomolecular NLP systems, provide an exceptional opportunity to pave the way for capture, integration and organization of phenotypic and genotypic data and knowledge that will be used to radically improve patient care. n/a",Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information,6781785,R01LM007659,"['cancer information system', 'clinical research', 'data collection', 'health science research', 'human data', 'informatics', 'library', 'medical records', 'molecular biology information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2004,468590,0.045917436357576766
"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,6749459,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information display', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'outcomes research', 'patient care management', 'performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2004,594553,0.05775274129762711
"Access to distributed de-identified imaging data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The widespread adoption of picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) in radiology and the implementation and deployment of the DICOM communication standard represent an opportunity to link multiple PACS at multiple sites into a distributed data warehouse of great potential utility for investigators in oncology research and epidemiology. Where the federal HIPAA privacy regulations have largely been seen as an emerging impediment to oncology research from the creation, management and use of cancer registries to large-scale retrospective studies addressing rarer forms of neoplasia, in fact the digital nature of PACS-based imaging data lends itself to automated de-identification that could transform multiple distributed clinical information systems into a readily accessible treasure trove of research data that falls within the ""safe harbor"" provisions of HIPAA's privacy regulations. Our firm has developed a platform, originally intended for clinical use, to securely link multiple PACS and RIS from multiple vendors beneath a web interface giving users transparent access to a ""virtual archive"" spanning an arbitrary number of institutions. In this Phase I SBIR application, we propose to explore the feasibility of extending our system to grant researchers access to large volumes of dynamically de-identified imaging data while surmounting each of the major criticisms of the viability of such data for research purposes. We propose developing an open web-services architecture that will enable straightforward integration with any other information system and propose a design that adheres to existing industry standards while laying the groundwork for compliance with future standards and informatics initiatives. This study will also involve examining the regulation of re-identification through the use of threshold cryptography, as well as the feasibility of a probabilistic sampling search engine intended to prevent unauthorized identification of patients through multiple intersecting queries on narrowing criteria, while still permitting researchers to choose the appropriate resolving power of the engine to suit a particular investigation. These studies will include benchmarking the performance of these dynamic processes, quantifying the load they place on live clinical information systems, and optimizing the design to minimize such impact. Should feasibility be demonstrated, Phase II would involve a proof-of-concept demonstration across multiple academic medical institutions as well as steps to prepare for commercialization including indexing studies based on structured reporting and natural language processing, content-based information retrieval, refinement and usability testing of the web interfaces, and extension of the system to permit IRB-approved research on individually-identifiable data. Commercialization is expected as subscription service not unlike current bioinformatics databases, granting investigators access to a large-scale, globally distributed data warehouse comprised of participating PACS-enabled medical centers. n/a",Access to distributed de-identified imaging data,6777517,R43EB000608,"['archives', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'confidentiality', 'data management', 'health care policy', 'health related legal', 'human data', 'imaging /visualization /scanning', 'information systems']",NIBIB,"HX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2004,149200,0.005026762188720055
"PACS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT-BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE The broad, tong-term objective of this Program Project Grant is to develop an effective imaging-based information and health care delivery system to support clinical practice, research, and education. The specific aims of the grant are to: (1) evolve PACS into an effective infrastructure that promotes the objectification of subjective patient clinical symptoms, (2) develop methods for improving the characterization of medical data through structured data collection, natural language processing of medical reports (NLP) and parametric summarization for medical images, (3) provide flexible, patient -specific presentation methods of medical images, timelines, and structured medical data. The objectification, intelligent access, and flexible presentation of medical data provide better information, which will facilitate the evidence-based practice of medicine and enhance research and evaluation. Five integrated projects employ novel techniques to address specific elements of the system. Intelligently selected imaging protocols are used to objectify patient symptoms. Well-defined information units capture and structure diverse forms of data, whether directly or indirectly through NP for text of parametric summarization for images. Patient medical records are correlated with medical literature by content. Timelines organize the data into a format that allow medical events, their dependencies, and conditional trends to be easily visualized (Project 3). Scenario-based proxies provide up-to-date access to relevant medical information. Relaxation broadens queries to medical information when exact matches are not found. Software toolkits and user models enable user-, and domain-, and task-specific customizations. The hardware independent architecture will facilitate access to the system across different platforms and software subsystems. Together, they form a unique infrastructure that provides broad and intelligently customized access to well-defined structured data and up-to-date literature.

"UMLS ENHANCED DYNAMIC AGENTS TO MANAGE MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE   DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                             With the explosion of medical information accessible via the Internet, there         is a growing need for development of better access to the online medical             literature databases through user-friendly systems and interface.  The               proliferation of online information and the diversity of interfaces to data          collections has led to a medical information gap between medical researchers         and the accessibility of medical literature databases.  Users who need access        to such information must visit a variety of sources, which can be both               excessively time consuming and potentially dangerous if the information is           needed for treatment decisions.  In addition, information generated by using         existing search engines is often too general or inaccurate.  Particularly            frustrating is that simple queries can result in an excessive number of              documents retrieved - too many to search through to determine which are and          which are not relevant.

"Mining Complex Clinical Data for Patient Safety Research Medical errors hurt patients, cost money, and undermine the health care system. The first step to reducing errors is detecting them, for what cannot be detected cannot be managed. A number of approaches have been applied to medical error detection, including mandatory event reporting, voluntary near-miss reporting, chart review, and automated surveillance using information systems. Automated surveillance promises large-scale detection, minimal labor, and, potentially, detection in real time to prevent or recover from errors. Unfortunately, large amounts of important clinical information lie locked in narrative reports, unavailable to automated decision support systems. A number of tools have emerged from medical informatics and computer science- natural language processing, visualization tools, and machine learning- as well as methods for understanding cognitive processes. We hypothesize that the electronic medical record contains information useful for detecting errors and that natural language processing and other tools will allow us to retrieve the information. We will assemble a team skilled in natural language processing, data mining, terminology, patient safety research, and health care. We will use a clinical repository with ten years of data on two million patients. It includes administrative, laboratory, and pharmacy coded information as well as a wide range of narrative reports including discharge summaries, operative reports, outpatient notes, autopsy reports, resident signout notes, nursing notes, and reports from numerous ancillary services (radiology, pathology, etc.). We will apply a proven natural language processor called MedLEE to code the information and measure the accuracy of automated queries to detect and characterize errors. We will target several areas: explicit error reporting in the medical record, NYPORTS mandatory event reporting, clinical conflicts in record, and other sources of error information. We will use a systems approach to errors and cognitive analysis to uncover cues to improve error detection. We will incorporate the system into the hospital's current event surveillance program and assess the impact on error detection. We will adhere to strict privacy policies and security procedures.

These regulations were motivated by the public's concern of breaches of confidentiality that might result in discrimination.  The recent progress in electronic medical record technology, the Internet, and the genetic revolution, together with media reports on violations of privacy have generated increasing interest in this topic.  A common belief is that sensitive information is more easily available with the use of networked computers. Since total lack of disclosure is not realistic, current regulations require that the ""minimal amount"" of information be given to a certain party.  A thorough study on what constitutes ""minimal"" for particular types of applications and a ""usefulness index"" is lacking.  An exact quantification of the potential for privacy breach in de-identified or anonymized databases is also lacking.  Definition and quantification of these indices is important for decision-making.  As we demonstrate, de-identified data sets can still be used for inference and therefore may disclose sensitive information.  The use of machine learning methods to verify the remaining functional dependencies in a de- identified data set leads to better understanding of the possible inferences.  Anonymization techniques based on logic, statistics, database theory, and machine learning methods can help in the protection of privacy. We will formally define and study anonymity in databases, from a theoretical and a practical standpoint.  We will develop and implement algorithms to anonymize data sets that will be in accordance with the balance of anonymity and ""usefulness"" of the disclosed data sets.  We will also develop and implement algorithms to verify the anonymity of a given data set and indicate the type of records that are at highest risk for a privacy attack.  We will make our methods and documented tools freely available to researchers via the WWW. n/a",Preserving Privacy in Medical Data Sets,6620783,R01LM007273,"['Internet', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' decision making', ' health care facility information system', ' health care policy', ' human data', ' human rights', ' information dissemination', ' information retrieval', ' mathematical model', ' medical records', ' model design /development', ' patient oriented research', ' statistics /biometry']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2003,380761,0.013042471033966486
"Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Narrative information is vital to health care, because it enables physicians to synthesize the raw facts and provide a context and interpretation for them.  Electronic medical record systems contain a wealth of clinical data, but typically lack the clinical narrative found in paper records, e.g., the patient history and progress notes.  Numerous barriers prevent the timely acquisition of narrative data, and most computer systems are unable to use such information productively.  Current approaches offer a tradeoff, capture of rich clinical data that lacks structure (using transcription services or speech technology), versus entry of structured data that lacks flexibility and expressiveness (using template systems).  Natural language processing can integrate these approaches by allowing physicians full freedom of expression while producing structured documents that preserve the richness and enable further computer processing.   This proposal seeks to capture and structure narrative in the online medical record in order to improve entry time, completeness, information content and consistency of clinical documentation.  The specific aims of this proposal are:  1) Maintain the continuity of the medical record; a lengthy medical record requires significant time to review and digest.  Many facts from past narratives remain true in the present or persist with minor changes.  By automatically bringing these facts forward into the current narrative, the system can reduce the time to enter the document, and improve the completeness of documentation by maintaining continuity of what is known about a patient; 2) Integrate the medical record:  Electronic medical records contain a vast amount of data.  However, most of these data are raw facts.  By helping the physician to connect, interpret and summarize these facts, the system can improve the usefulness of the information in the record, and reduce the time to enter documents by performing some syntheses automatically; and 3) Harmonize the medical record; the multidisciplinary nature of health care creates the potential for the differing perspectives and interpretations in the medical record, and even contradictions.  By bringing possible discrepancies to the attention of the physician, the system can help resolve the inconsistencies.     n/a",Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record,6665504,R01LM007268,"['automated medical record system', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' human data', ' information systems', ' medical records', ' online computer', ' primary care physician', ' vocabulary']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2003,424735,0.0608207384959382
"A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Consultation with appropriate specialists improves the quality of healthcare, particularly in patients with complicated cases or chronic illnesses. And for the majority of such patients, specialists use imaging studies (e.g., MR, CT) to objectively document the disease process (e.g., a cancer patient on chemotherapy). However, specialists are generally not available in all communities, tending to be concentrated in academic/specialty centers. Thus, to facilitate the routine use of teleconsultations for patients when specialists are not locally present: 1) the images captured to document the patient's condition must be incorporated into the medical record to enable proper review; and 2) the remote consultant should only receive pertinent parts of the medical record to streamline the consultation process. This proposal is focused on developing and testing a ""context-sensitive"" telehealth infrastructure based on: 1) automated incorporation of clinical context (patient presentation and referring physician hypothesis) to focus the consultation process; 2) a knowledge-base derived from data mining of natural language processing (NLP) results, mapping patient presentation to select an appropriate imaging study based on anatomical region and imaging parameters; and 3) automated selection of key anatomical structures in the acquired imaging study through the use of a contrast-customizable atlas and rigid body/deformable registration algorithms. Collectively, these technologies will allow context-sensitive, automated summarization of medical records for telehealth in a real-world environment. The proposed technologies will be implemented for neurological and musculoskeletal domains, two areas that are MR imaging intensive.      Technical evaluation will be performed with experts serving as the reference standard and will focus on measuring: 1) the accuracy of the corpus based, NLP-guided knowledge-base in selecting relevant anatomical structures; and 2) the accuracy of anatomical structure delineation using the customizable atlas registration methods. Clinical evaluation will be conducted in a real-world teleconsultation environment in a before/after study design using two performance metrics: 1) the time required for consultations; and 2) the effect on the quality of the consultations. n/a",A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure,6725819,R01EB002247,"['anatomy', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer data analysis', ' computer graphics /printing', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' health care quality', ' health care referral /consultation', ' human data', ' image enhancement', ' image processing', ' magnetic resonance imaging', ' musculoskeletal disorder', ' nervous system disorder', ' statistics /biometry', ' telemedicine']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2003,383268,0.028301737676339648
"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.  The availability of related compatible clinical and biomolecular NLP systems, provide an exceptional opportunity to pave the way for capture, integration and organization of phenotypic and genotypic data and knowledge that will be used to radically improve patient care. n/a",Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information,6558664,R01LM007659,"['cancer information system', ' clinical research', ' data collection', ' health science research', ' human data', ' informatics', ' library', ' medical records', ' molecular biology information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2003,464049,0.045917436357576766
"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,6678913,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' human data', ' informatics', ' information display', ' information system analysis', ' mathematical model', ' medical records', ' outcomes research', ' patient care management', ' performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2003,572597,0.05775274129762711
"Access to distributed de-identified imaging data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The widespread adoption of picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) in radiology and the implementation and deployment of the DICOM communication standard represent an opportunity to link multiple PACS at multiple sites into a distributed data warehouse of great potential utility for investigators in oncology research and epidemiology. Where the federal HIPAA privacy regulations have largely been seen as an emerging impediment to oncology research from the creation, management and use of cancer registries to large-scale retrospective studies addressing rarer forms of neoplasia, in fact the digital nature of PACS-based imaging data lends itself to automated de-identification that could transform multiple distributed clinical information systems into a readily accessible treasure trove of research data that falls within the ""safe harbor"" provisions of HIPAA's privacy regulations. Our firm has developed a platform, originally intended for clinical use, to securely link multiple PACS and RIS from multiple vendors beneath a web interface giving users transparent access to a ""virtual archive"" spanning an arbitrary number of institutions. In this Phase I SBIR application, we propose to explore the feasibility of extending our system to grant researchers access to large volumes of dynamically de-identified imaging data while surmounting each of the major criticisms of the viability of such data for research purposes. We propose developing an open web-services architecture that will enable straightforward integration with any other information system and propose a design that adheres to existing industry standards while laying the groundwork for compliance with future standards and informatics initiatives. This study will also involve examining the regulation of re-identification through the use of threshold cryptography, as well as the feasibility of a probabilistic sampling search engine intended to prevent unauthorized identification of patients through multiple intersecting queries on narrowing criteria, while still permitting researchers to choose the appropriate resolving power of the engine to suit a particular investigation. These studies will include benchmarking the performance of these dynamic processes, quantifying the load they place on live clinical information systems, and optimizing the design to minimize such impact. Should feasibility be demonstrated, Phase II would involve a proof-of-concept demonstration across multiple academic medical institutions as well as steps to prepare for commercialization including indexing studies based on structured reporting and natural language processing, content-based information retrieval, refinement and usability testing of the web interfaces, and extension of the system to permit IRB-approved research on individually-identifiable data. Commercialization is expected as subscription service not unlike current bioinformatics databases, granting investigators access to a large-scale, globally distributed data warehouse comprised of participating PACS-enabled medical centers. n/a",Access to distributed de-identified imaging data,6694270,R43EB000608,"['archives', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' health care policy', ' health related legal', ' human data', ' imaging /visualization /scanning', ' information systems']",NIBIB,"HX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2003,250800,0.005026762188720055
"PACS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT-BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE The broad, tong-term objective of this Program Project Grant is to develop an effective imaging-based information and health care delivery system to support clinical practice, research, and education. The specific aims of the grant are to: (1) evolve PACS into an effective infrastructure that promotes the objectification of subjective patient clinical symptoms, (2) develop methods for improving the characterization of medical data through structured data collection, natural language processing of medical reports (NLP) and parametric summarization for medical images, (3) provide flexible, patient -specific presentation methods of medical images, timelines, and structured medical data. The objectification, intelligent access, and flexible presentation of medical data provide better information, which will facilitate the evidence-based practice of medicine and enhance research and evaluation. Five integrated projects employ novel techniques to address specific elements of the system. Intelligently selected imaging protocols are used to objectify patient symptoms. Well-defined information units capture and structure diverse forms of data, whether directly or indirectly through NP for text of parametric summarization for images. Patient medical records are correlated with medical literature by content. Timelines organize the data into a format that allow medical events, their dependencies, and conditional trends to be easily visualized (Project 3). Scenario-based proxies provide up-to-date access to relevant medical information. Relaxation broadens queries to medical information when exact matches are not found. Software toolkits and user models enable user-, and domain-, and task-specific customizations. The hardware independent architecture will facilitate access to the system across different platforms and software subsystems. Together, they form a unique infrastructure that provides broad and intelligently customized access to well-defined structured data and up-to-date literature. This, in addition to patient-specific relevant data, expert opinion, and similar cases with known outcome, will promote the evidence-based practice of medicine.

"DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES A real-time clinical repository contains a wealth of detailed information useful for clinical care, research, and administration.  In their raw form, however, the data are difficult to use there is too much volume, too much detail, missing values, and inaccuracies. Clinicians, researchers, and administrators require higher level interpretations that address their questions. For example, a clinician may need to know whether a patient is at sufficient risk for having active tuberculosis to warrant respiratory isolation. The answer to the question may be spread around the clinical repository in chest radiographs, laboratory tests, medication histories, vital signs, and physician's notes. Translating from these raw data to the interpretation (at risk or not) is a difficult and laborious task. The hypothesis of this proposal is that data mining techniques can be applied to a real-time clinical repository to discover knowledge and generate accurate clinical interpretations, and that these interpretations can be automated. The project differs from earlier machine learning studies in its emphasis on a real clinical repository and the use of natural language processing to supply coded clinical data. The specific aims are: (l) Select clinical domains--Several clinical domains with interesting, non-trivial clinical problems will be selected. Problems for which a gold standard answer can or has been assembled for a retrospective cohort will be chosen. (2) Prepare raw clinical data for mining--The raw data from a clinical repository will be transformed into a structure that facilitates data mining. The data will be flattened, pivoted, summarized, and mapped as needed for the domains. Narrative data will be coded using the MedLEE natural language processor. The preparation process will be automated. (3) Use data mining algorithms to discover knowledge- Several data mining algorithms will be applied to the selected clinical domains. Algorithms will include decision tree generation, rule discovery, neural networks, nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and composite algorithms (for variable reduction). The algorithms will be trained on a training set for each domain, and their predictive accuracy will be measured and compared to each other and to expert-written rules. The performance of human experts writing rules using manual data mining visualization techniques (which does not require an explicit training set) will also be measured. (4) Study the dependence of data mining on the training set--The performance of data mining algorithms depends on the data used the train them. The sensitivity of the algorithms to noise (inaccurate data), missing data, and training set size will be measured. (5) Use the discovered knowledge to generate real-time interpretations-- The output of the algorithms (decision tree, rules, neural network equation, or logistic regression equation, but not nearest neighbor) along with the necessary data preparation steps will be encoded in Arden Syntax Medical Logic Modules. They will be run against the clinical repository to verify that the interpretation can be automated in real time. (6) Disseminate the methods and results--The methods and results will be disseminated via publications and a Web site, and tools will be made available.  n/a",DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES,6538211,R01LM006910,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' health care facility information system', ' human data', ' information dissemination', ' information system analysis', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2002,403006,0.004254779661751834
"UMLS ENHANCED DYNAMIC AGENTS TO MANAGE MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE   DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                             With the explosion of medical information accessible via the Internet, there         is a growing need for development of better access to the online medical             literature databases through user-friendly systems and interface.  The               proliferation of online information and the diversity of interfaces to data          collections has led to a medical information gap between medical researchers         and the accessibility of medical literature databases.  Users who need access        to such information must visit a variety of sources, which can be both               excessively time consuming and potentially dangerous if the information is           needed for treatment decisions.  In addition, information generated by using         existing search engines is often too general or inaccurate.  Particularly            frustrating is that simple queries can result in an excessive number of              documents retrieved - too many to search through to determine which are and          which are not relevant.

Each patient's        electronic data is used for clinical patient care and contains a potential       4000 variables per record.

"Mining Complex Clinical Data for Patient Safety Research Medical errors hurt patients, cost money, and undermine the health care system. The first step to reducing errors is detecting them, for what cannot be detected cannot be managed. A number of approaches have been applied to medical error detection, including mandatory event reporting, voluntary near-miss reporting, chart review, and automated surveillance using information systems. Automated surveillance promises large-scale detection, minimal labor, and, potentially, detection in real time to prevent or recover from errors. Unfortunately, large amounts of important clinical information lie locked in narrative reports, unavailable to automated decision support systems. A number of tools have emerged from medical informatics and computer science- natural language processing, visualization tools, and machine learning- as well as methods for understanding cognitive processes. We hypothesize that the electronic medical record contains information useful for detecting errors and that natural language processing and other tools will allow us to retrieve the information. We will assemble a team skilled in natural language processing, data mining, terminology, patient safety research, and health care. We will use a clinical repository with ten years of data on two million patients. It includes administrative, laboratory, and pharmacy coded information as well as a wide range of narrative reports including discharge summaries, operative reports, outpatient notes, autopsy reports, resident signout notes, nursing notes, and reports from numerous ancillary services (radiology, pathology, etc.). We will apply a proven natural language processor called MedLEE to code the information and measure the accuracy of automated queries to detect and characterize errors. We will target several areas: explicit error reporting in the medical record, NYPORTS mandatory event reporting, clinical conflicts in record, and other sources of error information. We will use a systems approach to errors and cognitive analysis to uncover cues to improve error detection. We will incorporate the system into the hospital's current event surveillance program and assess the impact on error detection. We will adhere to strict privacy policies and security procedures.

"Preserving Privacy in Medical Data Sets Privacy is a fundamental right and needs to be protected.  For health care related d information, there are regulations for disclosure.  These regulations were motivated by the public's concern of breaches of confidentiality that might result in discrimination.  The recent progress in electronic medical record technology, the Internet, and the genetic revolution, together with media reports on violations of privacy have generated increasing interest in this topic.  A common belief is that sensitive information is more easily available with the use of networked computers. Since total lack of disclosure is not realistic, current regulations require that the ""minimal amount"" of information be given to a certain party.  A thorough study on what constitutes ""minimal"" for particular types of applications and a ""usefulness index"" is lacking.  An exact quantification of the potential for privacy breach in de-identified or anonymized databases is also lacking.  Definition and quantification of these indices is important for decision-making.  As we demonstrate, de-identified data sets can still be used for inference and therefore may disclose sensitive information.  The use of machine learning methods to verify the remaining functional dependencies in a de- identified data set leads to better understanding of the possible inferences.  Anonymization techniques based on logic, statistics, database theory, and machine learning methods can help in the protection of privacy. We will formally define and study anonymity in databases, from a theoretical and a practical standpoint.  We will develop and implement algorithms to anonymize data sets that will be in accordance with the balance of anonymity and ""usefulness"" of the disclosed data sets.  We will also develop and implement algorithms to verify the anonymity of a given data set and indicate the type of records that are at highest risk for a privacy attack.

"Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Narrative information is vital to health care, because it enables physicians to synthesize the raw facts and provide a context and interpretation for them.  Electronic medical record systems contain a wealth of clinical data, but typically lack the clinical narrative found in paper records, e.g., the patient history and progress notes.  Numerous barriers prevent the timely acquisition of narrative data, and most computer systems are unable to use such information productively.  Current approaches offer a tradeoff, capture of rich clinical data that lacks structure (using transcription services or speech technology), versus entry of structured data that lacks flexibility and expressiveness (using template systems).  Natural language processing can integrate these approaches by allowing physicians full freedom of expression while producing structured documents that preserve the richness and enable further computer processing.   This proposal seeks to capture and structure narrative in the online medical record in order to improve entry time, completeness, information content and consistency of clinical documentation.  The specific aims of this proposal are:  1) Maintain the continuity of the medical record; a lengthy medical record requires significant time to review and digest.  Many facts from past narratives remain true in the present or persist with minor changes.  By automatically bringing these facts forward into the current narrative, the system can reduce the time to enter the document, and improve the completeness of documentation by maintaining continuity of what is known about a patient; 2) Integrate the medical record:  Electronic medical records contain a vast amount of data.  However, most of these data are raw facts.  By helping the physician to connect, interpret and summarize these facts, the system can improve the usefulness of the information in the record, and reduce the time to enter documents by performing some syntheses automatically; and 3) Harmonize the medical record; the multidisciplinary nature of health care creates the potential for the differing perspectives and interpretations in the medical record, and even contradictions.  By bringing possible discrepancies to the attention of the physician, the system can help resolve the inconsistencies.     n/a",Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record,6535939,R01LM007268,"['automated medical record system', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' human data', ' information systems', ' medical records', ' online computer', ' primary care physician', ' vocabulary']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2002,395391,0.0608207384959382

"UNLOCKING DATA FROM MEDICAL RECORDS WITH TEXT PROCESSING   DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                              The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP)        to help realize the full potential of the Electronic Medical Record (EMR).           Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to: 1) extract and encode              information in textual reports; 2) map terms to an authoritative vocabulary;         3) obtain comprehensive domain coverage based on the processing of domain            corpora; and 4) facilitate vocabulary development by providing visualization         tools using the Extensible Markup Language (XML).  It has already been               demonstrated that MedLEE, the NLP system we developed, accurately extracts and       codifies information in the EMR.  This current project builds upon our               experience with MedLEE and uses it to accomplish the latter three goals              concerning vocabulary development and standardization.                                                                                                                    More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map source terms to UMLS concepts.         MedLEE will process and structure the source terms and candidate UMLS                concepts.  Suitable matches will be found based on structural similarity             between components of the source term and candidate concepts.  This should           enhance current methods because knowledge of the type of modifiers that match        should improve the quality of the matches.  We will also use MedLEE to process       a large corpus and generate structured output in XML format.  Statistics based       on the structured output will be computed, and then clinically relevant              composite terms will be detected based on frequencies of the structures              containing the more elementary terms.  Our method differs from other discovery       methods because we use NLP techniques that identify semantic modifiers and           complex relations even if the terms are distant from each other, whereas other       methods use statistical co-occurrence data based on adjacency.  The individual       XML structures and statistics will be combined and mapped into a single XML          tree.  It will be possible to visualize the tree and frequencies using an XML        tree viewer, to navigate the tree, to manipulate the tree, and to reorganize         the tree according to different axes (i.e., procedure, body location,                finding).                                                                                                                                                                 The use of a sophisticated NLP system, such as MedLEE, is ideal as a                 foundation for our proposed work in vocabulary development and                       standardization; medical terminology is an integral part of medical language         and a state of the art NLP system is especially equipped to handle the               inherent complexities of language. n/a",UNLOCKING DATA FROM MEDICAL RECORDS WITH TEXT PROCESSING,6490773,R01LM006274,"['abstracting', ' automated medical record system', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' human data', ' information retrieval', ' method development', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,QUEENS COLLEGE,R01,2002,288252,0.0425015246607493
"PACS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT-BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE The broad, tong-term objective of this Program Project Grant is to develop an effective imaging-based information and health care delivery system to support clinical practice, research, and education. The specific aims of the grant are to: (1) evolve PACS into an effective infrastructure that promotes the objectification of subjective patient clinical symptoms, (2) develop methods for improving the characterization of medical data through structured data collection, natural language processing of medical reports (NLP) and parametric summarization for medical images, (3) provide flexible, patient -specific presentation methods of medical images, timelines, and structured medical data. The objectification, intelligent access, and flexible presentation of medical data provide better information, which will facilitate the evidence-based practice of medicine and enhance research and evaluation. Five integrated projects employ novel techniques to address specific elements of the system. Intelligently selected imaging protocols are used to objectify patient symptoms. Well-defined information units capture and structure diverse forms of data, whether directly or indirectly through NP for text of parametric summarization for images. Patient medical records are correlated with medical literature by content. Timelines organize the data into a format that allow medical events, their dependencies, and conditional trends to be easily visualized (Project 3). Scenario-based proxies provide up-to-date access to relevant medical information. Relaxation broadens queries to medical information when exact matches are not found. Software toolkits and user models enable user-, and domain-, and task-specific customizations. The hardware independent architecture will facilitate access to the system across different platforms and software subsystems. Together, they form a unique infrastructure that provides broad and intelligently customized access to well-defined structured data and up-to-date literature. This, in addition to patient-specific relevant data, expert opinion, and similar cases with known outcome, will promote the evidence-based practice of medicine.

"DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES A real-time clinical repository contains a wealth of detailed information useful for clinical care, research, and administration.  In their raw form, however, the data are difficult to use there is too much volume, too much detail, missing values, and inaccuracies. Clinicians, researchers, and administrators require higher level interpretations that address their questions. For example, a clinician may need to know whether a patient is at sufficient risk for having active tuberculosis to warrant respiratory isolation. The answer to the question may be spread around the clinical repository in chest radiographs, laboratory tests, medication histories, vital signs, and physician's notes. Translating from these raw data to the interpretation (at risk or not) is a difficult and laborious task. The hypothesis of this proposal is that data mining techniques can be applied to a real-time clinical repository to discover knowledge and generate accurate clinical interpretations, and that these interpretations can be automated. The project differs from earlier machine learning studies in its emphasis on a real clinical repository and the use of natural language processing to supply coded clinical data. The specific aims are: (l) Select clinical domains--Several clinical domains with interesting, non-trivial clinical problems will be selected. Problems for which a gold standard answer can or has been assembled for a retrospective cohort will be chosen. (2) Prepare raw clinical data for mining--The raw data from a clinical repository will be transformed into a structure that facilitates data mining. The data will be flattened, pivoted, summarized, and mapped as needed for the domains. Narrative data will be coded using the MedLEE natural language processor. The preparation process will be automated. (3) Use data mining algorithms to discover knowledge- Several data mining algorithms will be applied to the selected clinical domains. Algorithms will include decision tree generation, rule discovery, neural networks, nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and composite algorithms (for variable reduction). The algorithms will be trained on a training set for each domain, and their predictive accuracy will be measured and compared to each other and to expert-written rules. The performance of human experts writing rules using manual data mining visualization techniques (which does not require an explicit training set) will also be measured. (4) Study the dependence of data mining on the training set--The performance of data mining algorithms depends on the data used the train them. The sensitivity of the algorithms to noise (inaccurate data), missing data, and training set size will be measured. (5) Use the discovered knowledge to generate real-time interpretations-- The output of the algorithms (decision tree, rules, neural network equation, or logistic regression equation, but not nearest neighbor) along with the necessary data preparation steps will be encoded in Arden Syntax Medical Logic Modules. They will be run against the clinical repository to verify that the interpretation can be automated in real time. (6) Disseminate the methods and results--The methods and results will be disseminated via publications and a Web site, and tools will be made available.  n/a",DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES,6391286,R01LM006910,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' health care facility information system', ' human data', ' information dissemination', ' information system analysis', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2001,396315,0.004254779661751834
"UMLS ENHANCED DYNAMIC AGENTS TO MANAGE MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE   DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                             With the explosion of medical information accessible via the Internet, there         is a growing need for development of better access to the online medical             literature databases through user-friendly systems and interface.  The               proliferation of online information and the diversity of interfaces to data          collections has led to a medical information gap between medical researchers         and the accessibility of medical literature databases.  Users who need access        to such information must visit a variety of sources, which can be both               excessively time consuming and potentially dangerous if the information is           needed for treatment decisions.  In addition, information generated by using         existing search engines is often too general or inaccurate.  Particularly            frustrating is that simple queries can result in an excessive number of              documents retrieved - too many to search through to determine which are and          which are not relevant.

"Mining Complex Clinical Data for Patient Safety Research Medical errors hurt patients, cost money, and undermine the health care system. The first step to reducing errors is detecting them, for what cannot be detected cannot be managed. A number of approaches have been applied to medical error detection, including mandatory event reporting, voluntary near-miss reporting, chart review, and automated surveillance using information systems. Automated surveillance promises large-scale detection, minimal labor, and, potentially, detection in real time to prevent or recover from errors. Unfortunately, large amounts of important clinical information lie locked in narrative reports, unavailable to automated decision support systems. A number of tools have emerged from medical informatics and computer science- natural language processing, visualization tools, and machine learning- as well as methods for understanding cognitive processes. We hypothesize that the electronic medical record contains information useful for detecting errors and that natural language processing and other tools will allow us to retrieve the information. We will assemble a team skilled in natural language processing, data mining, terminology, patient safety research, and health care. We will use a clinical repository with ten years of data on two million patients. It includes administrative, laboratory, and pharmacy coded information as well as a wide range of narrative reports including discharge summaries, operative reports, outpatient notes, autopsy reports, resident signout notes, nursing notes, and reports from numerous ancillary services (radiology, pathology, etc.). We will apply a proven natural language processor called MedLEE to code the information and measure the accuracy of automated queries to detect and characterize errors. We will target several areas: explicit error reporting in the medical record, NYPORTS mandatory event reporting, clinical conflicts in record, and other sources of error information.

"UNLOCKING DATA FROM MEDICAL RECORDS WITH TEXT PROCESSING   DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                              The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP)        to help realize the full potential of the Electronic Medical Record (EMR).           Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to: 1) extract and encode              information in textual reports; 2) map terms to an authoritative vocabulary;         3) obtain comprehensive domain coverage based on the processing of domain            corpora; and 4) facilitate vocabulary development by providing visualization         tools using the Extensible Markup Language (XML).  It has already been               demonstrated that MedLEE, the NLP system we developed, accurately extracts and       codifies information in the EMR.  This current project builds upon our               experience with MedLEE and uses it to accomplish the latter three goals              concerning vocabulary development and standardization.                                                                                                                    More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map source terms to UMLS concepts.         MedLEE will process and structure the source terms and candidate UMLS                concepts.  Suitable matches will be found based on structural similarity             between components of the source term and candidate concepts.  This should           enhance current methods because knowledge of the type of modifiers that match        should improve the quality of the matches.  We will also use MedLEE to process       a large corpus and generate structured output in XML format.  Statistics based       on the structured output will be computed, and then clinically relevant              composite terms will be detected based on frequencies of the structures              containing the more elementary terms.  Our method differs from other discovery       methods because we use NLP techniques that identify semantic modifiers and           complex relations even if the terms are distant from each other, whereas other       methods use statistical co-occurrence data based on adjacency.  The individual       XML structures and statistics will be combined and mapped into a single XML          tree.  It will be possible to visualize the tree and frequencies using an XML        tree viewer, to navigate the tree, to manipulate the tree, and to reorganize         the tree according to different axes (i.e., procedure, body location,                finding).                                                                                                                                                                 The use of a sophisticated NLP system, such as MedLEE, is ideal as a                 foundation for our proposed work in vocabulary development and                       standardization; medical terminology is an integral part of medical language         and a state of the art NLP system is especially equipped to handle the               inherent complexities of language. n/a",UNLOCKING DATA FROM MEDICAL RECORDS WITH TEXT PROCESSING,6095940,R01LM006274,"['abstracting', ' automated medical record system', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' human data', ' information retrieval', ' method development', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,QUEENS COLLEGE,R01,2001,303860,0.0425015246607493
"PACS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT-BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE The broad, tong-term objective of this Program Project Grant is to develop an effective imaging-based information and health care delivery system to support clinical practice, research, and education. The specific aims of the grant are to: (1) evolve PACS into an effective infrastructure that promotes the objectification of subjective patient clinical symptoms, (2) develop methods for improving the characterization of medical data through structured data collection, natural language processing of medical reports (NLP) and parametric summarization for medical images, (3) provide flexible, patient -specific presentation methods of medical images, timelines, and structured medical data. The objectification, intelligent access, and flexible presentation of medical data provide better information, which will facilitate the evidence-based practice of medicine and enhance research and evaluation. Five integrated projects employ novel techniques to address specific elements of the system. Intelligently selected imaging protocols are used to objectify patient symptoms. Well-defined information units capture and structure diverse forms of data, whether directly or indirectly through NP for text of parametric summarization for images. Patient medical records are correlated with medical literature by content. Timelines organize the data into a format that allow medical events, their dependencies, and conditional trends to be easily visualized (Project 3). Scenario-based proxies provide up-to-date access to relevant medical information. Relaxation broadens queries to medical information when exact matches are not found. Software toolkits and user models enable user-, and domain-, and task-specific customizations. The hardware independent architecture will facilitate access to the system across different platforms and software subsystems. Together, they form a unique infrastructure that provides broad and intelligently customized access to well-defined structured data and up-to-date literature.

"DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES A real-time clinical repository contains a wealth of detailed information useful for clinical care, research, and administration.  In their raw form, however, the data are difficult to use there is too much volume, too much detail, missing values, and inaccuracies. Clinicians, researchers, and administrators require higher level interpretations that address their questions. For example, a clinician may need to know whether a patient is at sufficient risk for having active tuberculosis to warrant respiratory isolation. The answer to the question may be spread around the clinical repository in chest radiographs, laboratory tests, medication histories, vital signs, and physician's notes. Translating from these raw data to the interpretation (at risk or not) is a difficult and laborious task. The hypothesis of this proposal is that data mining techniques can be applied to a real-time clinical repository to discover knowledge and generate accurate clinical interpretations, and that these interpretations can be automated. The project differs from earlier machine learning studies in its emphasis on a real clinical repository and the use of natural language processing to supply coded clinical data. The specific aims are: (l) Select clinical domains--Several clinical domains with interesting, non-trivial clinical problems will be selected. Problems for which a gold standard answer can or has been assembled for a retrospective cohort will be chosen. (2) Prepare raw clinical data for mining--The raw data from a clinical repository will be transformed into a structure that facilitates data mining. The data will be flattened, pivoted, summarized, and mapped as needed for the domains. Narrative data will be coded using the MedLEE natural language processor. The preparation process will be automated. (3) Use data mining algorithms to discover knowledge- Several data mining algorithms will be applied to the selected clinical domains. Algorithms will include decision tree generation, rule discovery, neural networks, nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and composite algorithms (for variable reduction). The algorithms will be trained on a training set for each domain, and their predictive accuracy will be measured and compared to each other and to expert-written rules. The performance of human experts writing rules using manual data mining visualization techniques (which does not require an explicit training set) will also be measured. (4) Study the dependence of data mining on the training set--The performance of data mining algorithms depends on the data used the train them. The sensitivity of the algorithms to noise (inaccurate data), missing data, and training set size will be measured. (5) Use the discovered knowledge to generate real-time interpretations-- The output of the algorithms (decision tree, rules, neural network equation, or logistic regression equation, but not nearest neighbor) along with the necessary data preparation steps will be encoded in Arden Syntax Medical Logic Modules. They will be run against the clinical repository to verify that the interpretation can be automated in real time. (6) Disseminate the methods and results--The methods and results will be disseminated via publications and a Web site, and tools will be made available.  n/a",DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES,6031325,R01LM006910,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' health care facility information system', ' human data', ' information dissemination', ' information system analysis', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2000,433383,0.004254779661751834
"IMIA WG6 CONFERENCE The basic science of representing patient events, findings, interventions, and outcomes in a semantically consistent and logically reproducible way is medical concept representation.  It embodies principles of linguistics, logic, computer science, cognition, biology and clinical medicine to undertake this highly multidisciplinary activity. Much of this work is undertaken in experimental settings, which hypothesize practical extensions to existing models, and test their utility against standardized retrieval sets or clinical usability environments. The proposed conference intends to continue the tradition of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA), Working Group 6 on Medical Concept Representation, to provide a forum for the academic discussion of problems, issues, theories, and applications of natural language processing, knowledge representation, terminology development, and concept coordination to biomedicine and healthcare.  the proposed tracks at this time are: 1.

"KNOWLEDGE BASES FOR STRUCTURED CARDIOVASCULAR REPORTING Healthcare has lagged behind other industries in automating the storage and retrieval of information. While billing, blood testing, and other services are widely computerized, the bulk of patient clinical information is not. The central barrier to coding clinically useful data - patient historical, test, and procedural results - is the absence of effective knowledge frameworks for entry and review of clinical data. For this reason, sofiware for storage and retrieval of patient data remains suboptimal. This project focuses on methods for recording a specific subset of patient data: results of cardiovascular tests, Although only a subset of clinical knowledge, cardiovascular procedure reporting is typical of the larger problem of how knowledge is handled. Moreover, there is an unmet market demand for cardiology reportrng tools. In Phase I we will develop a methodology for creating and maintaining the knowledge bases needed for structured entry of cardiovascular data. We will apply and hone this methodology by creating two important knowledge bases: echocardiography and cardiac catheterization. Together with the methodology we use, these two developments will dovetail into a larger Phase II  project of systematically addressing knowledge-representation and structured data entry for cardiology. Beyond Phase II  we will apply our methodology to other branches of medicine. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: This research will provide a means to optimize structured recording of patient test results in a computer-searchable format improving the process of procedural reporting, and facilitating implementation of an electronic medical record.  n/a",KNOWLEDGE BASES FOR STRUCTURED CARDIOVASCULAR REPORTING,6141030,R43HL062806,"['artificial intelligence', ' cardiovascular disorder diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' data management', ' echocardiography', ' heart catheterization', ' human data', ' informatics']",NHLBI,"CYBERPULSE, LLC",R43,2000,107000,0.014710664128719847

"A framework to enhance radiology structured report by invoking NLP and DL:  Models and Applications PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  In radiology practices, timely and accurate formulation of reports is closely linked to patient satisfaction, physician productivity, and reimbursement. While the American College of Radiology and the Radiological Soci- ety of North America have recommended implementation of structured reporting to facilitate clear and consistent communication between radiologists and referring clinicians, cumbersome nature of current structured reporting systems made them unpopular amongst their users. Recently, the emerging techniques of deep learning have been widely and successfully applied in many different natural language processing tasks (NLP). However, when adopted in a certain speciﬁc domain, such as radiology, these techniques should be combined with extensive domain knowledge to improve efﬁciency and accuracy. There is, therefore, a critical need to take advantage of clinical NLP and deep learning to fundamentally change the radiology reporting. The long-term goal in this appli- cation is to improve the form, content, and quality of radiology reports and to facilitate rapid generation of radiol- ogy reports with consistent organization and standardized texts. The overall objective is to use radiology-speciﬁc ontology, NLP and computer vision techniques, and deep learning to construct a radiology-speciﬁc knowledge graph, which will then be used to build a reporting system that can assist radiologists to quickly generate struc- tured and standardized text reports. The rationale for this project is that through integration of new clinical NLP technologies, radiology-speciﬁc knowledge graphs, and development of new reporting system, we can build au- tomatous systems with a higher-level understanding of the radiological world. The speciﬁc aims of this project are to: (1) recognize and normalize named entities in radiology reports; (2) construct a radiology-speciﬁc knowledge graph from free-text and images; and (3) build a reporting system that can dynamically adjust templates based on radiologists' prior entries. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it combines deep learning, NLP techniques, and domain knowledge in a single framework to construct comprehensive and accurate knowledge graphs that will enhance the workﬂow of the current reporting systems. The proposed research is signiﬁcant because a novel reporting system can expedite radiologists' workﬂow and acquire well-annotated datasets that facilitate machine learning and data science. To develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Yifan Peng, requires additional training and mentoring in clinical NLP and radiology. During the K99 phase, Dr. Peng will conduct this research as a research fellow at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. He will be mentored by Dr. Zhiyong Lu, a leading text mining and deep learning researcher, and co- mentored by Dr. Ronald M. Summers, a leading radiologist and clinical informatics researcher. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Peng to achieve the career goals of becoming an independent investigator and leader in the study of clinical NLP. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it entails a new strategy to construct a radiology- speciﬁc knowledge graph to facilitate the development of a new reporting system that enables rapid generation of structured radiology reports. The proposed knowledge graph and reporting system will contribute to advancement in understanding of the radiological world, and promise to enhance clinical communication and patient-centric care. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NLM's mission that pertains to applying deep knowledge of clinical terminology and natural language processing to improve clinical data science and health services.",A framework to enhance radiology structured report by invoking NLP and DL:  Models and Applications,10197509,R00LM013001,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'American College of Radiology', 'Award', 'Biotechnology', 'Caring', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Formulation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health Services', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nomenclature', 'North America', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resort', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'impression', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge graph', 'lexical', 'long short term memory', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'repository', 'response', 'syntax', 'text searching']",NLM,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R00,2020,236549,0.01950236990176332
"CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare Project Summary Wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to huge clinical databases, which enable the rapid growth of healthcare analytics market. One particular challenge for analyzing EHRs data is that much detailed patient information is embedded in clinical documents and not directly available for downstream analysis. Therefore, clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information embedded in clinical narratives, have received great attention, with an estimated global market of $2.65 billion by 2021 . In our previous work, we have developed CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing), a clinical NLP tool with demonstrated superior performance through multiple international NLP challenges and a large user community (over 1,500 downloads by users from over 700 organizations). Commercialization of CLAMP by Melax Technologies Inc. has been successful (i.e., with a dozen licensed customers now); but it also reveals its limitations as a desktop application in the Cloud era. Therefore, we propose to extend CLAMP to a new Cloud- based, Service-oriented platform (called CLAMP-CS), which will address the identified challenges by: 1) improving clinical NLP performance and reducing annotation cost by leveraging the state-of-the-art algorithms such as deep learning, active learning and transfer learning and making them accessible to less experienced users; 2) following new service-oriented architectures to make CLAMP-CS available via SaaS and PaaS, ready for Cloud-based development and deployment; and 3) improving CLAMP-CS interoperability with downstream applications following two widely used standard representations: HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and OMOP CMD (Common Data Model), to support the use cases in clinical operations and research respectively. With these advanced features, we believe CLAMP-CS will be a leading clinical NLP system in the market and it will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical/translational research. Project Narrative In this study, we plan to develop a new clinical natural language processing (NLP) tool based on the existing widely used CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing) system, to support enterprise development and deployment of NLP solutions in healthcare. We believe that the new generation of Cloud- based, service-oriented NLP tool will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical and translational research.","CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare",10011177,R44TR003254,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Belief', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Administration', 'International', 'Language', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Operations Research', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Records', 'Research', 'Services', 'System', 'Technology', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Work', 'active method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'language training', 'learning algorithm', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rapid growth', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NCATS,"MELAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2020,503546,0.05424104294339562
"Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing Project Summary Automatic extraction of useful information from clinical texts enables new clinical research tasks and new technologies at the point of care. The natural language processing (NLP) systems that perform this extraction rely on supervised machine learning. The learning process uses manually labeled datasets that are limited in size and scope, and as a result, applying NLP systems to unseen datasets often results in severely degraded performance. Obtaining larger and broader datasets is unlikely due to the expense of the manual labeling process and the difficulty of sharing text data between multiple different institutions. Therefore, this project develops unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms to adapt NLP systems to new data. Domain adaptation describes the process of adapting a machine learning system to new data sources. The proposed methods are unsupervised in that they do not require manual labels for the new data. This project has three aims. The first aim makes use of multiple existing datasets for the same task to study the differences in domains, and uses this information to develop new domain adaptation algorithms. Evaluation uses standard machine learning metrics, and analysis of performance is tightly bounded by strong baselines from below and realistic upper bounds, both based on theoretical research on machine learning generalization. The second aim develops open source software tools to simplify the process of incorporating domain adaptation into clinical text processing workflows. This software will have input interfaces to connect to methods developed in Aim 1 and output interfaces to connect with Apache cTAKES, a widely used open- source NLP tool. Aim 3 tests these methods in an end-to-end use case, adverse drug event (ADE) extraction on a dataset of pediatric pulmonary hypertension notes. ADE extraction relies on multiple NLP systems, so this use case is able to show how broad improvements to NLP methods can improve downstream methods. This aim also creates new manual labels for the dataset for an end-to-end evaluation that directly measures how improvements to the NLP systems lead to improvement in ADE extraction. Project Narrative Software systems that use machine learning to understand clinical text often suffer severe performance loss when they are applied to new data that looks different than the data that they originally learned from. In this project, we develop and implement methods that allow these systems to automatically adapt to the characteristics of a new data source. We evaluate these methods on the clinical research task of adverse drug event detection, which relies on many different variables found in the text of electronic health records.",Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing,9986899,R01LM012918,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Apache', 'Area', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Human', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Network-based', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'adaptation algorithm', 'base', 'case finding', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'method development', 'natural language', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'news', 'novel', 'open source', 'point of care', 'side effect', 'social media', 'software systems', 'statistics', 'structured data', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tumor', 'unsupervised learning']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,383874,0.02066145513950768
"Natural Language Processing and Automated Speech Recognition to Identify Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment Project Summary The purpose of this proposal is to develop two strategies, natural language processing (NLP) and automated speech analysis (ASA), to enable automated identification of patients with cognitive impairment (CI), from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) in clinical settings. The number of older adults in the United States with MCI and ADRD is increasing and yet the ability of clinicians and researchers to identify them at scale has advanced little over recent decades and screening with clinical assessments is done inconsistently. Alternative strategies using available data, like analysis of diagnostic codes in the clinical record or insurance claims, have very low sensitivity. NLP and ASA used with machine learning are technologies that could greatly increase ability to detect MCI and ADRD in clinical contexts. NLP automatically converts text in the electronic health record (EHR) into structured concepts suitable for analysis. Thus, clinicians’ documentation of signs and symptoms or orders of tests and services that reflect or address cognitive limitations can be efficiently captured, possibly long before the clinician uses an ADRD-related diagnostic code. ASA directly measures cognition by recognizing different features of cognition captured in speech. Extracting features through both NLP and ASA could thus provide a unique measure of cognition and its impact on the individual and their caregivers. Early detection of MCI and ADRD can help researchers identify appropriate patients for research and help clinicians and health systems target patients for preventive care and care coordination. For these reasons, more efficient, highly scalable strategies are needed to identify people with MCI and ADRD. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to (1) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from the EHR with NLP to identify patients with CI, (2) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from ASA of audio recordings of patient-provider encounters during routine primary care visits to identify patients with CI, (3) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using both NLP and ASA extracted features to create an integrated CI diagnostic algorithm. We will develop machine learning algorithms using NLP and ASA extracted features trained against neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validate them in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. In secondary analyses we will train ML algorithms to identify MCI and its subtypes. This project will be the most rigorous development of NLP, ASA, and ML algorithms for CI yet performed, the first to test ASA in primary care settings, and the first to test NLP and ASA feature extraction strategies in combination. The multi-disciplinary team of clinicians, health services researchers, and neurocognitive and data scientists will apply machine learning to develop these highly scalable, automated technologies for identification of MCI and ADRD. 1 Project Narrative The ability of clinicians, health systems and researchers to identify patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) is limited. This project will apply machine learning to natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health record data and automated speech analysis (ASA) of patient-doctor conversations during primary care visits to identify patients with MCI and ADRD using automated and scalable procedures. The analytic algorithms will be developed with neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validated in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. 1",Natural Language Processing and Automated Speech Recognition to Identify Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment,9998610,R01AG066471,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Caregivers', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'New York City', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'adverse event risk', 'aging population', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'care coordination', 'clinical encounter', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'falls', 'feature extraction', 'financial incentive', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental state', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'screening', 'secondary analysis', 'structured data', 'success', 'testing services', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'unstructured data']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,855710,0.014489761643395518
"Fine-grained spatial information extraction for radiology reports ABSTRACT Automated biomedical image classification has seen enormous improvements in performance over recent years, particularly in radiology. However, the machine learning (ML) methods that have achieved this remarkable performance often require enormous amounts of labeled data for training. An increasingly accepted means of acquiring this data is through the use of natural language processing (NLP) on the free-text reports associated with an image For example, take the following brain MRI report snippet:  There is evidence of left parietal encephalomalacia consistent with known history of prior stroke. Small  focal area of hemosiderin deposition along the lateral margins of the left lateral ventricle. Here, the associated MRI could be labeled for both Encephalomalacia and Hemosiderin. NLP methods to automatically label images in this way have been used to create several large image classification datasets However, as this example demonstrates, radiology reports often contain far more granular information than prior NLP methods attempted to extract. Both findings in the above example mention their anatomical location, which linguistically is referred to as a spatial grounding, as the location anchors the finding in a spatial reference. Further, the encephalomalacia finding is connected to the related diagnosis of stroke, while the hemosiderin finding provides a morphological description (small focal area). This granular information is important for image classification, as advanced deep learning methods are capable of utilizing highly granular structured data. This is logical, as for instance a lung tumor has a slightly different presentation than a liver tumor. If an ML algorithm can leverage both the coarse information (the general presentation of a tumor) while also recognizing the subtle granular differences, it can find an optimal balance between specificity and generalizability. From an imaging perspective, this can also be seen as a middle ground between image-level labels (which are cheap but require significant data for training—a typical dataset has thousands of images or more) and segmentation (which is expensive to obtain, but provides better training data—a typical dataset has 40 to 200 images), as the fine-grained spatial labels correspond to natural anatomical segments. Our fundamental hypothesis in this project is that if granular information can be extracted from radiology reports with NLP, this will improve downstream radiological image classification when training on a sufficiently large dataset. For radiology, the primary form of granularity is spatial (location, shape, orientation, etc.), so this will be the focus of our efforts. We further hypothesize that these NLP techniques will be generalizable to most types of radiology reports. For the purpose of this R21-scale project, however, we will focus on three distinct types of reports with different challenges: chest X-rays (one of the most-studied and largest-scale image classification types), extremity X-rays (which offer different findings than chest X-rays), and brain MRIs (which present a different image modality and the additional complexity of three dimensions). NARRATIVE This project is interested in developing natural language processing (NLP) methods for better understanding the spatial relationships described in the free text data within radiology reports found in electronic health record (EHR) systems. We will (i) develop an ontology, (ii) manually create a dataset for training NLP methods, (iii) develop automatic NLP methods compatible the ontology and corpus, and (iv) evaluate automatic image classification methods that use the output of the NLP system as image labels.",Fine-grained spatial information extraction for radiology reports,9957898,R21EB029575,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Encephalomalacia', 'Equilibrium', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hemosiderin', 'Human', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Limb structure', 'Linguistics', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Location', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Performance', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Training', 'Trust', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'deep learning', 'design', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'lateral ventricle', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'radiological imaging', 'scale up', 'spatial relationship', 'structured data', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2020,271250,0.011039570157239397
"Use of Machine Learning on Integrated Electronic Medical Record, Genetic and Waveform Data to Predict Perioperative Cardiorespiratory Instability Project Summary/Abstract  The objective of this K01 application is to give Dr. Hofer the necessary training and research experience to establish himself as an independent investigator focused on using machine learning (ML) on a variety of healthcare data to predict outcomes during the perioperative period. The career development activities consist of escalating coursework on machine learning beginning with an online course of ML fundamentals and ending with a UCLA course on ML applications in healthcare. Augmenting these courses are tutorials on the application of these techniques to healthcare data and a research program is designed to use ML on healthcare data to predict perioperative cardio-respiratory instability (CRI) – specifically hypotension and arrhythmia.  To achieve these goals, Dr. Hofer has established an outstanding team of leaders in machine learning, perioperative medicine, and clinical informatics. Dr. Maxime Cannesson, his primary mentor, is an expert in perioperative medicine and the use of ML on physiologic signals. Dr. Eran Halperin, the co-mentor for this pro- posal, is an expert in ML and its application to genomic and other healthcare data. Dr. Hofer has ongoing collab- orations with Drs. Cannesson and Halperin on joint projects. Both Drs. Cannesson and Halperin have a strong track record of mentoring individuals who have progressed to independent and productive academic careers. Dr. Hofer will be aided by an advisory committee consisting of Dr. Douglas Bell (who will provide guidance on integrating data from multiple sources), Dr. Mohammed Mahbouba (providing support regarding data security and creating enterprise level analytic solutions) and Dr. Jeanine Wiener-Kronish (providing guidance on the most relevant questions in perioperative outcome prediction).  Challenges managing CRI have been implicated in the more than 15 million annual postoperative com- plications, costing more than $165 billion, however no scores exist to predict CRI. This study will leverage unique infrastructure at UCLA where whole EMR data has been combined with physiologic waveforms and genomic data on more than 30,000 patients. This proposal will use a variety of ML techniques on these data to create predictive models for CRI.  In summary, this proposal will provide Dr. Hofer with both technical training in ML and hands on experi- ence in using ML to predict perioperative outcomes. This study has the potential to create models that will help clinicians predict, and thus avoid, perioperative instability, thereby improving patient outcomes. Additionally, this program will provide Dr. Hofer with the tools he needs to successfully compete for a R01 focusing on using ML models on a variety of healthcare data to predict the downstream effects of CRI – perioperative complications. Project Narrative During the perioperative period hemodynamic instability is the norm rather than the exception; the ability of clinicians to manage this instability has been associated with postoperative complications affecting more than 15 million Americans and costing more than $165 billion each year. There are no current risk scores that predict instability in real time, however the recent widespread adoption of electronic medical records and creation of genomic biobanks creates unique opportunities to develop scores that are both accurate and precise. We will use machine learning techniques to create risk scores for perioperative cardiorespiratory instability – specifically hypotension and arrhythmia – using combined electronic medical record, genomic and physiologic waveform data.","Use of Machine Learning on Integrated Electronic Medical Record, Genetic and Waveform Data to Predict Perioperative Cardiorespiratory Instability",10055690,K01HL150318,"['Acute', 'Adoption', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atlases', 'California', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hypotension', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Inpatients', 'Joints', 'Latino', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical History', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative complication', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'biobank', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diverse data', 'electronic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'feeding', 'genetic information', 'genetic profiling', 'genomic data', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'long short term memory', 'multiple data sources', 'online course', 'outcome prediction', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'random forest', 'structured data', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K01,2020,175284,0.00818224971520126

"Open Health Natural Language Processing Collaboratory Project Summary One of the major barriers in leveraging Electronic Health Record (EHR) data for clinical and translational science is the prevalent use of unstructured or semi-structured clinical narratives for documenting clinical information. Natural Language Processing (NLP), which extracts structured information from narratives, has received great attention and has played a critical role in enabling secondary use of EHRs for clinical and translational research. As demonstrated by large scale efforts such as ACT (Accrual of patients for Clinical Trials), eMERGE, and PCORnet, using EHR data for research rests on the capabilities of a robust data and informatics infrastructure that allows the structuring of clinical narratives and supports the extraction of clinical information for downstream applications. Current successful NLP use cases often require a strong informatics team (with NLP experts) to work with clinicians to supply their domain knowledge and build customized NLP engines iteratively. This requires close collaboration between NLP experts and clinicians, not feasible at institutions with limited informatics support. Additionally, the usability, portability, and generalizability of the NLP systems are still limited, partially due to the lack of access to EHRs across institutions to train the systems. The limited availability of EHR data limits the training available to improve the workforce competence in clinical NLP. We aim to address the above challenges by extending our existing collaboration among multiple CTSA hubs on open health natural language processing (OHNLP) to share distributional information of NLP artifacts (i.e., words, n-grams, phrases, sentences, concept mentions, concepts, and text segments) acquired from real EHRs across multiple institutions. We will leverage the advanced privacy-preserving computing infrastructure of iDASH (integrating Data for Analysis, Anonymization, and SHaring) for privacy- preserving data analysis models and will partner with diverse communities including Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), PCORnet, and Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) to demonstrate the utility of NLP for translational research. This CTSA innovation award RFA provides us with a unique opportunity to address the challenges faced with clinical NLP and through strong partnership with multiple research communities and leadership roles of the research team in clinical NLP, we envision that the successful delivery of this project will broaden the utilization of clinical NLP across the research community. There are four aims planned: i) obtain PHI-suppressed NLP artifacts with retained distribution information across multiple institutions and assess the privacy risk of accessing PHI- suppressed artifacts, ii) generate a synthetic text corpus for exploratory analysis of clinical narratives and assess its utility in NLP tasks leveraging various NLP challenges, iii) develop privacy-preserving computational phenotyping models empowered with NLP, and iv) partner with diverse communities to demonstrate the utility of our project for translational research.

"Prediction of therapist cultural competency using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models PROJECT SUMMARY  Racial-ethnic minorities (REM) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals experience high levels of psychological distress. Psychological treatments can be effective in addressing mental health concerns, but disparities in quality of care still exist. Although systemic and institutional factors contribute to disparities in care, mental health providers are also critical to examine. A primary focus of efforts to understand and reduce provider contributions to mental health care disparities has been to examine cultural competency (CC), which involves a provider’s ability to navigate the cultural aspects of clinical interactions. Patient ratings of CC are generally associated with treatment outcomes and therapeutic processes. While patient perceptions of provider CC are important, a reliance on retrospective patient ratings limits what we know about how cultural identities are discussed, and the language that constitutes culturally sensitive care. Many studies of provider CC also require observers or patients to make complex judgments based on internal provider characteristics that are not reliably observable (e.g. rate provider awareness of their own cultural values). More studies are needed that examine patient-provider interactions in treatment in order to assess the impact of specific provider behaviors, and how they relate to perceptions of provider CC. Recently, Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have been applied to psychotherapy conversations to automatically capture the use of evidence based treatments, topics of conversation, empathy, and emotional expression. Prior research demonstrating the feasibility of automatically identifying topics of conversation in psychotherapy suggest that NLP models could be trained to automatically identify specific moments in sessions where patients and providers are talking about cultural issues. NLP models could allow researchers to not only examine how specific patterns of provider-patient interactions drive CC, but might also provide rapid feedback to providers, and in turn help address disparities in care. The purpose of the current study is to do the foundational work to develop and evaluate NLP tools that capture the cultural content of provider-patient interactions among REM and LGBTQ patients. First, utilizing 32,436 labeled talk turns from 200 psychotherapy sessions we will evaluate the accuracy of NLP models in recognizing the discussion of cultural topics in psychotherapy. Second, we will use NLP models to explore differences in the content of 1,235 psychotherapy sessions that were rated as highly positive or negative on a measure of cultural competence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although disparities in the quality of mental health treatment for racial-ethnic minority (REM) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) patients are well known, to date there are no tools that can identify specific patterns of provider-patient interactions that drive disparities in care. This project will evaluate the ability of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to recognize discussion of cultural topics in psychotherapy among REM and LGBTQ patients, and explore differences in patient-provider interactions with low and high patient ratings of provider cultural competency.",Prediction of therapist cultural competency using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models,9906653,F31MD014941,"['Address', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Discrimination', 'Empathy', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Label', 'Language', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychotherapy', 'Quality of Care', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Suicide', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'base', 'commercial application', 'community setting', 'cultural competence', 'cultural values', 'disparity reduction', 'effective intervention', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'health care disparity', 'improved', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'racial and ethnic', 'sexual identity', 'showing emotion', 'substance abuse treatment', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'treatment disparity', 'university student', 'willingness']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F31,2020,45016,0.011701911102250688
"Optimizing the Utility of Large Electronic Health Records Data in Data-Driven Health Research Optimizing the Utility of Electronic Medical Records Data in  Data-driven Health Research ABSTRACT Medical centers continue to archive patient follow-up data in Electronic Medical Records (EMR), which have tremendous value in discovering new knowledge and insights. The large volume of EMR data can play an important role in improving the accuracy and generalizability of predictive models in healthcare, especially when misdiagnosis is known to be the third leading cause of death in the United States. Despite these merits, EMR data are invariably corrupted by factors like missing values, outliers, and unrealistic measurements, which prevent researchers from fully utilizing such abundant data in many important studies. Many studies simply discard a large number of samples to get rid of missingness and eventually bias their data-driven analytical models. Existing techniques for missing data imputation use simplified linear models and are mostly suitable for imputing cross-sectional data missingness that ignore longitudinal missingness in patient follow-up data. This proposal aims to investigate novel artificial intelligence (AI) based models to improve the quality and utility of EMR data in preparation for data-driven retrospective studies. Toward this preparation, the goal of the project is 1) to investigate more accurate and robust data imputation models compared to existing ones and 2) adapt state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in preparing optimal representation of large EMR data. The proposed research will 1) maximize the quality and utility of EMR data to support a multitude of retrospective studies, 2) enable visualization of complex patient data, 3) identify more important and predictive clinical parameters, 4) yield a compact and optimal representation of large EMR datasets. We hypothesize that optimally processed EMR data with state-of-the-art AI models can most accurately model patient risk when compared to existing statistical and clinical risk models. This project will combine the complementary expertise of the collaborators, Dr. Manar Samad, PhD (Computer Science), Dr. Owen Johnson, DPH (Biostatistics and Public Health), and Dr. Edilberto Raynes, MD, PhD (Medicine) along with the participating undergraduate students at Tennessee State University (TSU). The proposal entails several research and development components that will allow undergraduate students to gain valuable research and analytical skills in data science, programming, and health informatics. The project activities will expose health science students to AI-based computing solutions to broaden their scope of future health research and career. This project will help TSU prepare a strong workforce of minority students who will gain competitive skill sets in data science and health informatics that are currently high in demand almost everywhere. Overall, the project will develop a data-capable workforce to strengthen an interdisciplinary research capacity and collaboration between the Departments of Computer and Health science at TSU. Project Narrative Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data are invariably corrupted by data missingness and data redundancy that limit their application in many valuable data-driven research studies aiming to achieve the goals of precision medicine. This project aims to develop a number of innovative computational frameworks that will optimally prepare and utilize EMR data to facilitate research studies with relevance to patient risk modeling, discovery of new health markers, and patient-specific prognosis and therapeutic strategy. The project will leverage recent advances in machine learning and data science by involving an interdisciplinary team of researchers consisting of three faculty members, two graduate students, and four undergraduate students, which will establish a data-centric research collaboration between the Departments of Computer and Health Science.",Optimizing the Utility of Large Electronic Health Records Data in Data-Driven Health Research,10111205,R15LM013569,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Tennessee', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'base', 'career', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'complex data ', 'computational platform', 'computer framework', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'data quality', 'data structure', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'graduate student', 'health science research', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'minority student', 'neural network', 'non-linear transformation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'recurrent neural network', 'research and development', 'research study', 'skills', 'structured data', 'survival prediction', 'undergraduate student']",NLM,TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2020,421700,0.01636926010533591
"Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records ABSTRACT: There are nearly 7,000 diseases that have a prevalence of only one in 2,000 individuals or less. Yet, such rare diseases are estimated to collectively affect over 300 million people worldwide, representing a significant healthcare concern. Although rare diseases have predominantly genetic origins, nearly half of them do not manifest symptoms until adulthood and frequently confound discovery and diagnosis. Even in the case of early onset disorders, the sheer number of possible diagnoses can often overwhelm clinicians. As a result, rare diseases are often diagnosed with delay, misdiagnosed or even remain undiagnosed, not only disrupting patient lives but also hindering progress on our understanding of such diseases. Data science methods that mine large-scale retrospective health record data for phenotypic information will aid in timely and accurate diagnoses of rare diseases, especially when combined with additional data types, thus, having significant real- world impact. This proposal will integrate electronic health record (EHR) data sets with publicly available vocabularies and ontologies, and genomic data for the improved identification and characterization of patients with rare diseases, using approaches from machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and basic bioinformatics. The work has three specific aims and will be carried out in two phases. During the mentored phase, the principal investigator (PI) will develop data-driven methods to extract standardized concepts related to rare diseases from clinical notes and infer the occurrence of each disease (Aim 1). He will also develop data science approaches to compare and contrast longitudinal patterns associated with patients' journeys through the healthcare system when seeking a diagnosis for a rare disease, and aid in clinical decision-making by leveraging these patterns (Aim 2). During the independent phase (Aim 3), computational methods will be developed for the integrated modeling and analysis of genotypic (from Aim 3) and phenotypic information (from Aims 1 and 2). Cohorts to be sequenced will cover diseases for which causal genes or disease definitions are unclear (discovery), as well as those for which these are well known (validation). This work will be carried out under the mentorship of four faculty members with complementary expertise in biomedical informatics, data science, NLP, and rare disease genomics at the University of Washington, the largest medical system in the Pacific Northwest (four million EHRs), world-renowned researchers in medical genetics, and a robust data science environment. In addition, under the direction of the mentoring team, the PI will complete advanced coursework, receive training in translational bioinformatics and clinical research informatics, submit manuscripts, and seek an independent research position. This proposal will yield preliminary results for subsequent studies on data-driven phenotyping and enable the realization of the PI's career goals by providing him with the necessary training to build on his machine learning and basic bioinformatics expertise to transition into an independent investigator in biomedical data science. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare genetic diseases are estimated to affect the lives of 25 to 30 million Americans and their families, and present a significant economic burden on the healthcare system. Currently, our knowledge of the broad spectrum of the 7,000 observed rare diseases is limited to a few well-studied ones, hindering our ability to make correct and timely diagnoses. The objective of this study is to improve the identification of patients with rare diseases in healthcare systems by developing data science approaches that automatically recognize rare disease-related patterns in patient health records and correlate them with genomic data, thus, aiding in diagnosis and discovery.",Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records,9884791,K99LM012992,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Markov Chains', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Washington', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'causal variant', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease phenotype', 'early onset disorder', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'member', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient health information', 'phenotypic data', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'rare condition', 'rare genetic disorder', 'recruit', 'skills', 'software development', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,92070,0.0024875880799837867
"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); In recent years, there has been increasing evidence supporting the role of DSs in ADRD in preventing cognitive impairment but there is limited evidence and the sample sizes have been small. Real- world data (RWD) especially the EHR contain detailed treatment and response information from patients and could be used to detect the usage and effect of DSs, DSIs, which is more translational to clinical outcomes (e.g., MCI to ADRD conversion). To the best of our knowledge, there is no investigation on DSs usage and safety among patients in MCI and ADRD using EHR data. Our current parent award is focusing on the development of a translational informatics framework to enable the discovery of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs) by linking scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. To response to NOT-AG-20-008, this administrative supplement application will complement our parent award in multiple aspects: (1) developing novel and advanced data analytic methods for mining RWD in EHR, (2) identifying DSs usage information among patients with ADRD, and (3) detecting safety and effect of DS among patients with ADRD from existing EHR data. In our preliminary work, we have investigated the methods to identify DSs terms on EHR and developed natural language processing (NLP) methods to identify use status of DSs. We will further our efforts to collect a EHR dataset with DSs usage and AE-DSs signals from AD patients and develop innovative informatics methods to extract such information. Our specific aims are: (1) identifying DSs usage among patients with MCI and ADRD from existing EHR data; and (2) detecting the DSs safety signals and exploring the effect of DSs use on the conversion from MCI to ADRD from existing EHR data. The successful completion of this project will stimulate our further investigation on the role of DS use in patients with ADRD in a larger scale involving EHR data from other healthcare institutions. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this administrative supplement application, we will evaluate the usage and safety of dietary supplements (DSs) usage in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), respectively using electronic health records (EHR) data. We will also explore the feasibility of using EHR to detect DS effect on the conversion from MCI to ADRD. This research will address a critical and unmet need to conduct large-scale clinical research in DSs and improve evidence bases for healthcare practice. The successful accomplishment of this supplement project will deliver a novel informatics methods and generate DSI signals among patients with ADRD.

"National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2): Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives Project Summary and Abstract Narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) contain useful information that is difficult to automatically extract, index, search, or interpret. Natural language processing (NLP) technologies can extract this information and convert it in to a structured format that is more readily accessible by computerized systems. However, the development of NLP systems is contingent on access to relevant data and EHRs are notoriously difficult to obtain because of privacy reasons. Despite the recent efforts to de-identify and release narrative EHRs for research, these data are still very rare. As a result, clinical NLP, as a field has lagged behind. To address this problem, since 2006, we organized thirteen shared tasks, accompanied with workshops and journal publications. Twelve of these shared tasks have focused on the development of clinical NLP systems and the remaining one on the usability of these systems. We have covered both depth and breadth in terms of shared tasks, preparing tasks that study cutting-edge NLP problems on a variety of EHR data from multiple institutions. Our shared tasks are the longest running series of clinical NLP shared tasks, with ever growing EHR data sets, tasks, and participation. Our most popular three data sets have been cited 495 (2010 data), 284 (2006 de-id data), and 274 (2009 data) times, respectively, representing hundreds of articles that have come out of these three data sets alone. Our goal in this proposal is to continue the efforts we started in 2006 under i2b2 shared task challenges (i2b2, NIH NLM U54LM008748, PI: Kohane and R13 LM011411, PI: Uzuner) to de-identify EHRs, annotate them with gold- standard annotations for clinical NLP tasks, and release them to the research community for the development and head-to-head comparison of clinical NLP systems, for the advancement of the state of the art. Continuing our efforts under National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) based at the Health Data Science program of the newly established Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, we aim to form partnerships with the community to grow the shared task efforts in several ways: (1) grow the available de-identified EHR data sets through partnerships that can contribute to the volume and variety of the data, and (2) grow the available gold-standard annotations in terms of depth and breadth of NLP tasks. Given these aims and partnerships, we plan to hold a series of shared tasks. We will complement these shared tasks with workshops that meet in conjunction with the Fall Symposium of the American Medical Informatics Association and with journal special issues so that advancement of the state of the art can be sped up and future generations can build on the past. Project Narrative We propose to organize a series of shared tasks, workshops, and journal publications for fostering the continuous development of clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies that can extract information from narratives of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Our aim is to grow the annotated gold standard EHR data sets that are available to the research community through partnerships and to bring together clinical NLP researchers with informatics researchers for building collaborations. We will engage the community in shared tasks and disseminate the knowledge generated by these shared tasks through workshops and journal special issues for the advancement of the state of the art.",National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2): Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives,9930152,R13LM013127,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'American', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Future Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Israel', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Privacy', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Series', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Targeted Research', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical development', 'computerized', 'falls', 'head-to-head comparison', 'health data', 'indexing', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'practical application', 'programs', 'symposium', 'usability', 'working group']",NLM,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,R13,2020,20000,0.049855709937103206
"Automated Knowledge Engineering Methods to Improve Consumers' Comprehension of their Health Records PROJECT SUMMARY  Today, more patients can access their health records online than ever before. However, clinical acronyms hinder patients' comprehension of their records and decrease the benefits of transparency. An automated system for expanding clinical acronyms should have major clinical significance and far-reaching consequences for improving patient-provider communication, shared decision-making, and health outcomes. Existing systems have limited power to expand clinical acronyms, primarily due to the lack of comprehensiveness (or generali- zability) of existing acronym sense inventories. Because developing comprehensive sense inventories is difficult, existing knowledge engineering methods have primarily focused on developing institution-specific sense inventories. Institution-specific sense inventories may not be generalizable to other geographical regions and medical specialties. Furthermore, developing an institution-specific sense inventory at every US healthcare organization is not feasible, especially without automated methods which currently do not exist.  I developed advanced knowledge engineering methods to overcome these limitations through the use of fully automated techniques to generalize existing sense inventories from different geographical regions and medical specialties. My methods leverage the extensive resources already devoted to developing institution- specific sense inventories in the U.S., and may help generalize existing sense inventories to institutions without the resources to develop them. Although promising, challenges remain with the optimization and evaluation of these methods. The objective of the proposed project is to use knowledge engineering to improve patients' comprehension of their health records, focusing specifically on clinical acronyms. In Aim 1, I will develop new knowledge engineering methods to facilitate the automated integration of sense inventories, using literature- based quality heuristics and a Siamese neural network to establish synonymy. I will evaluate these methods using multiple metrics to assess redundancy, quality, and coverage in two test corpora with over 17 million clinical notes. In Aim 2, I will evaluate whether the knowledge engineering methods improve comprehension of doctors' notes in 60 hospitalized patients with advanced heart failure. With success, I will create novel, automated knowledge engineering methods that can be directly applied to improve patient care. This research is in support of my mentored doctoral training at Columbia University Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) under Drs. David Vawdrey, George Hripcsak, Carol Friedman, Suzanne Bakken, and Chunhua Weng, and will include coursework on deep learning, oral presentations at major annual conferences, and career development planning, among other activities. DBMI is frequently recognized as one of the oldest and best programs of its kind in the world, and provides an exception training environment for my development into an independent and productive academic investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical acronyms make it difficult for patients to understand their medical records, decreasing the benefits of transparency.

"Data-driven shared decision-making to reduce symptom burden in atrial fibrillation PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia with symptoms that directly impair health-related quality of life (HRQoL). While catheter ablation is routinely performed to reduce AF symptoms and improve HRQoL, we lack evidence about which symptoms are likely to improve and for which patients. Ablations themselves may cause complications that lead to lower HRQoL. Shared decision-making (SDM) is a widely encouraged practice to navigate such complex choices by aligning treatment benefits and risks with the patient's stated values. However, no SDM interventions have focused explicitly on AF symptoms due to a lack of rigorous evidence about post-ablation symptom patterns and the decision aids necessary to communicate those findings. In this K99/R00 application, we propose to use data from electronic health records (EHRs) to characterize post-ablation symptom patterns, and display them in decision-aid visualizations to support personalized SDM about the best treatment modalities for an individual's patient's AF symptoms. In the K99 phase, we will use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to extract and analyze symptom data from narrative notes in EHRs. We will also employ a rigorous, user-centered design protocol created during my postdoctoral work to develop decision-aid visualizations. In the R00 phase, we will conduct a feasibility study in which the interactive decision-aid visualizations are introduced during consultations about ablation in clinical electrophysiology practices. Our specific aims are: (1) identify common symptom patterns in patients with paroxysmal AF post-catheter ablation (n>32,014); (2) develop and evaluate decision-aid visualizations of common AF symptom patterns (n=50); and (3) evaluate the feasibility of implementing the decision-aid visualizations in clinical practice (n=75). The training objectives of this project include mastering competencies in NLP, ML, human-computer interaction, symptom science, and implementation science. The long-term training goal is to assist Dr. Reading Turchioe to become a faculty member with an independent program of research. She seeks to lead an interdisciplinary team of scientists and clinicians committed to improving symptom management and HRQoL for individuals living with AF and other chronic cardiovascular conditions, with an eye towards health equity. To ensure success for the planned research and training activities, a multidisciplinary team of mentors with complementary expertise, established, well-funded programs of research, and a record of mentoring high-quality trainees will advise her. Moreover, this research will be conducted in a world-class academic medical center with exceptional resources for building and implementing technology and data science methods using EHR data. The proposed research is both significant and innovative: NLP and ML methods to extract EHR data for decision-aid visualizations are a novel approach to SDM in the understudied area of AF symptoms. Together, these techniques promise to enhance HRQoL for other AF treatment modalities (e.g. medications, lifestyle changes) and other chronic cardiovascular conditions. ! ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Our research has public health significance because atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and expected to double in prevalence in the next decade as the population ages. “Real-world evidence” from electronic health record data displayed in personalized decision-aid visualizations can enable patients and providers to choose together the optimal treatments for symptom reduction. Our proposal addresses NINR's key areas of “Symptom Science: Promoting Personalized Health Strategies” and “Promoting Innovation: Technology to Improve Health” by leveraging innovative technologies to deliver personalized interventions that reduce symptom burden and improve quality of life for individuals with chronic conditions. !",Data-driven shared decision-making to reduce symptom burden in atrial fibrillation,9953270,K99NR019124,"['Ablation', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiac ablation', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Devices', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Enabling Factors', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fatigue', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Informatics', 'Outcome', 'Palpitations', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Reinforcing Factor', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'common symptom', 'comorbidity', 'computer human interaction', 'data visualization', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health equity', 'health related quality of life', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized decision', 'personalized intervention', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'reduce symptoms', 'shared decision making', 'statistics', 'success', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treatment risk', 'user centered design']",NINR,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K99,2020,87632,0.010859062593665028
"Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data SUMMARY The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic health records (EHR) that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of patients throughout the country. The observational data emerging from these systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the effectiveness of existing and novel treatments, and to monitor potential safety issues that may arise when interventions are used in broad patient populations. However, observational clinical data have exposures that are driven by many factors and therefore aggressive adjustment is needed to remove as much confounding bias as possible in order to make attribution regarding select exposures. The field of machine learning provides a powerful collection of data-driven approaches for performing flexible, thorough confounding adjustment, but performing reliable statistical inference is particularly challenging when these techniques are used as part of the analytic strategy. We propose to advance reproducible research methods by developing and illustrating novel targeted learning tools that leverage the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect and characterize health effect signals using large-scale EHR data. Specifically, we will first develop techniques for making efficient, statistically valid and robust inference for treatment effects using state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We will also develop online learning techniques to make such inference in the context of streaming EHR data. Methodological advances will enable us to formulate a formal, rigorous and practical framework for conducting continuous, effective and reliable surveillance for safety endpoints. Finally, we will develop statistical approaches for incorporating prior information -- including demographic, epidemiologic or pharmacodynamic knowledge, for example -- to improve health effect estimation and inference when the health outcome of interest is rare and the statistical problem is thus difficult, as often occurs in safety surveillance. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to enable biomedical researchers and public health regulators to carefully monitor and protect the health of the public by allowing them to more effectively and more reliably detect critical health effect signals that may be contained in population-scale EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic medical records that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of U.S. subjects. The population scale of contemporary health care data is opening new opportunities for quickly learning from observational data, and is now supporting on-going national surveillance that will monitor the risks and benefits of both existing and novel treatment paths. The objective of this proposal is to provide an inferential framework that leverages the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect health effect signals, including in the important setting of high-dimensional confounders and/or rare events, and to develop a real-time sequential updating methodology for safety signal detection.",Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data,9979940,R01HL137808,"['Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative treatment', 'data streams', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'national surveillance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'risk minimization', 'software development', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,485987,0.016156354737762415
"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques,10118580,R00NR017651,"['18 year old', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncology', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Pruritus', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge translation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'patient oriented', 'pre-doctoral', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2020,248966,0.0034305962131376297
"Developing scalable algorithms to incorporate unstructured electronic health records for causal inference based on real-world data Project Summary/Abstract The routine operation of the US Healthcare system produces an abundance of electronically-stored data that captures the care of patients as it is provided in settings outside of controlled research environments. The potential for utilizing these data to inform future treatment choices and improve patient care and outcomes of all patients in the very system that generates the data is widely acknowledged. Given these key properties of the routine-care data and the abundance of electronic healthcare databases covering millions of patients, it is critical to strengthen the rigor of analyses of such data. Our group has previously developed an analytic approach to reduce bias when analyzing routine-care databases, which has proven effective in more than 50 empirical research studies across a range of topics and data sources. However, this approach currently cannot incorporate free-text information that is recorded in electronic health records, such as clinical notes and reports. This limitation has left a large amount of rich patient information underutilized for clinical research. We thus aim to adapt and refine a set of established computerized natural language processing algorithms that can identify and extract useful information from the clinical notes and reports in electronic health records and incorporate them into our validated analytical approach for balancing background risks of different comparison groups, a key step to ensure fair evaluation when comparing different therapeutic options. To test this newly integrated and augmented approach, we will implement and adapt it in simulation studies where we can evaluate and improve the performance of these new analytic methods in a controlled but realistic fashion. In addition, we will assess the performance of our new approach in 8 practical studies comparing medical or surgical treatments that are highly relevant to patients. To ensure highest level of data completeness and quality, we have linked multiple healthcare utilization (claims) databases, spanning from 2007 to 2016, with 3 electronic health records systems, including one each in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Texas. This data will allow testing of our newly integrated approach in a variety of care delivery systems and data environments, which will be very informative for the application of our products in the real-world settings. Narrative The project will yield a highly flexible and effective analytical method for reducing confounding bias in studies that utilize routine-care data to compare effects of medical or surgical treatments. This method will enable researchers to leverage a large amount of patient information recorded in the clinical notes and reports that are contained within electronic health records to adjust for differences in background risks of different comparison groups. Our proposal can improve the quality of evidence based on electronic healthcare data generated in the routine-care settings to better inform patient care and optimal prescribing.",Developing scalable algorithms to incorporate unstructured electronic health records for causal inference based on real-world data,9970594,R01LM013204,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Empirical Research', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Influentials', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'North Carolina', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparison group', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'health care service utilization', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'preservation', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'routine care', 'safety study', 'simulation', 'sound', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'unstructured data']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,469927,0.020451310944733625
"Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic cigarettes were developed in China in the early 2000s and first introduced to the US market in 2007. Once established in the US, the product experienced explosive growth, with the number of electronic cigarette users doubling every year between 2008 and 2012. In 2012, it was estimated that 75% of US adults had heard of electronic cigarettes, and 8% had tried them. While electronic cigarettes have been studied over the last sev- eral years, no scientific consensus has emerged regarding either the safety of electronic cigarettes, or their po- tential as a smoking cessation aid. With this proposal, we will investigate how electronic cigarette use is documented in the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record, focusing specifically on the relationship between electronic cigarette use and com- bustible tobacco use, with the goal of understanding both how electronic cigarette use is documented in the context of the United States’ only nationwide health system, and how electronic cigarette related information can be reliably extracted from narrative clinical text using fully automated Natural Language Processing meth- ods. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research focuses on the use of Natural Language Processing methods to automatically extract mentions of electronic cigarette use from the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record. The research will provide insight into important, currently unresolved questions regarding how clinicians record electronic cigarette use in the context of a nationwide health system, and whether patients report the use of electronic cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid or use the devices in conjunction with combustible tobacco.",Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR,9852435,R03DA047577,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'China', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Professional Organizations', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Smoking', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'authority', 'electronic cigarette use', 'electronic cigarette user', 'electronic hookah', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'smoking cessation', 'structured data', 'success', 'systems research', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'vape pens']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R03,2020,76250,0.047041437209476136
"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team. Through this career development plan, Dr. Shah will build upon her prior training in clinical cardiology and research methodology and lay a strong foundation for a high impact research career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Atrial fibrillation affects six million US adults, and the prevalence is expected to double by 2030.

"Multicenter Study of the Emergency Department Trigger Tool Existing methods for surveillance of patient harm in the ED setting are inadequate, without any meaningful change in decades. Trigger tools, popularized by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s Global Trigger Tool, have been developed for multiple clinical areas and are used across the world, outperform traditional approaches for surveillance of adverse events. These tools use a two-tiered review process where a nurse screens records for triggers (predefined findings that make the presence of an AE more likely) and reviews records with triggers for AEs, discarding those without triggers. We developed a consensus-based ED trigger tool (EDTT) using a multicenter, transdisciplinary modified Delphi approach, subsequently pilot testing this in a multicenter fashion with encouraging results. This was followed by a recently completed, AHRQ-funded single center study to automate, refine and validate this tool. This study demonstrated that the EDTT is a high-yield and efficient instrument for identifying adverse events in the ED. The present study will evaluate the refined, automated EDTT), in a multicenter study. We will evaluate the EDTT’s generalizability and robustness at three sites with large emergency departments, with a planned in-depth review of 9,000 ED admissions. We will use natural language processing of electronic medical record narratives and machine learning to improve the EDTT efficiency in trigger detection and AE discovery. We will establish the basis for a wider use and prepare for scalability and usability of the tool, creating standardized, streamlined and free online training materials, and by evaluating the tool in a real-world manner consistent with intended use. Project Narrative Commonly used approaches in Emergency Departments to detect adverse events are low yield and have not changed in decades, providing inadequate surveillance for patient harm. The need for improved methodology is critical, given the evolving role of the emergency department in the health care system. Trigger tools, developed for use in many healthcare settings across the world, detect all-cause harm, helping direct resources by identifying areas of risk and allowing an assessment of the effectiveness of quality improvement efforts over time. Trigger tools involve screening of records by a nurse for triggers (findings that make an adverse event more likely) and a review of only records with triggers searching for adverse events. Any events identified undergo confirmatory physician review. We developed a trigger tool for the ED, applying rigorous methods to identify predictive triggers, to computerize the screen for triggers eliminating manual review and improving record selection to enhance yield and efficiency. This tool demonstrates superior performance for detecting adverse events. We will now test this tool in a multicenter project to evaluate its broad application, confirming its utility and to continue to improve its yield and efficiency in adverse event detection by applying natural language processing and machine learning techniques.",Multicenter Study of the Emergency Department Trigger Tool,10098792,R01HS027811,[' '],AHRQ,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,398528,0.022941274939404777
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes.

"Collaborative Research: Statistical algorithms for anomaly detection and patterns recognition in patient care and safety event reports Medical errors have been shown to be the third leading cause of death in the United States. The Institute of Medicine and several state legislatures have recommended the use of patient safety event reporting systems (PSRS) to better understand and improve safety hazards. Numerous healthcare providers have adopted these systems, which provide a framework for healthcare provlder staff to report patient safety events. Public databases like MAUDE and VAERS have also been created to collect and trend safety events across healthcare systems. A patient safety event (PSE) report generally consists of both structured and unstructured data elements. Structured data are pre-defined, fixed fields that solicit specific information about the event. The unstructured data fields generally include a free text field where the reporter can enter a text description of the event. The text descriptions are often a rich data source in that the reporter ls not constrained to limited categories or selection options and is able to freely descrlbe the details of the event. The goal of this project is to develop novel statistical methods to analyze unstructured text like patient safety event reports arising in healthcare, which can lead to significant improvements to patient safety and enable timely intervention strategies. We address three problems: (a) Building realistic and meaningful baseline models for near misses, and detecting systematic deterioration of adverse outcomes relative to such baselines; (b) Understanding critical factors that lead to near misses & quantifying severity of outcomes; and (c) ldentifylng document groups of interest. We will use novel statistical approaches that combine Natural Language Processing with Statistical Process Monitoring, Statistical Networks Analysis, and Spatio-temporal Modeling to build a generalizable toolbox that can address these issues in healthcare. An important advantage of our research team is the involvement of healthcare domain experts and access to frontline staff, and we will leverage this strength to develop our algorithms. A key feature of our work is the generalizability of our methods, which will be applicable to biomedical documents arising across a remarkable variety of areas, such as patient safety and equipment malfunction reports, electronic health records, adverse drug or vaccine reports, etc. We will also release open source software via R packages & GitHub, which will enable healthcare staff and researchers to execute our methods on their datasets. Estimates of preventable adverse events in healthcare are staggering, despite the frequently cited Institute of Medicine (IOM) report that first brought attention to the problem over ten years ago. Identifying temporal trends and patterns in the data is particularly important to improving patient safety and patient care. Using our algorithms to effectively analyze documents from reporting systems has the potential to dramatically improve the safety and quality of care by exposing possible weaknesses in the care process.",Collaborative Research: Statistical algorithms for anomaly detection and patterns recognition in patient care and safety event reports,10211805,R01LM013309,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment Malfunction', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Interest Group', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Report (document)', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'hazard', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'spatiotemporal', 'structured data', 'trend', 'unstructured data']",NLM,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R01,2020,278731,0.02233242751555683
"Application of a Machine Learning to Enhance e-Triggers to Detect and Learn from Diagnostic Safety Events The frequency of diagnostic errors in emergency departments (ED) is largely unknown but likely to be significant. There is a compelling need to create measurement methods that provide diagnostic safety data to clinicians and leaders who in turn can act upon these data to prevent diagnostic harm. Electronic trigger (e- trigger) tools mine vast amounts of clinical and administrative data to identify signals for likely adverse events and have demonstrated capability to identify diagnostic errors. Such tools are more efficient and effective than other methods and can reduce the number of records requiring human review to those at highest risk of harm.  In prior work, we used rules-based e-trigger algorithms to identify patterns of care suggestive of missed or delayed diagnoses in primary care and inpatient settings. For instance, a clinic visit followed several days later by an unplanned hospitalization could be indicative of potential problems with the diagnostic process at the clinic visit. We also proposed a knowledge discovery framework, the Safer Dx Trigger Tools Framework, to enable health care organizations (HCOs) to develop and implement e-trigger tools to measure diagnostic errors using comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) data. Review and analysis of these cases can uncover safety concerns and provide information on diagnostic process breakdowns and related contributory factors, which in turn could generate learning and feedback for improvement purposes.  Sophisticated techniques from machine learning (ML) and data science could help inform ‘second generation’ e-trigger algorithms that better identify diagnostic errors and/or harm than rules-based e-triggers that require substantial manual effort and chart reviews. In contrast to rules-based systems, ML techniques could help learn from examples and accurately retrieve charts with diagnostic error without the need for “hand crafting” of an e-trigger. We will apply e-triggers to comprehensive EHRs that contain longitudinal patient care data (progress notes, tests, referrals) that provide an extensive picture of patients’ diagnostic journeys. Using national VA data, including data from 9 million veterans, and data from Geisinger health system, a pioneer HCO that serves approximately 3 million patients, we propose the following aims: Aim 1 – To develop, refine, test, and apply Safer Dx e-triggers to enable detection, measurement, and learning from diagnostic errors in diverse emergency department (ED) settings. We will calculate the frequency of diagnostic errors in the ED based on these e-triggers and describe the burden of preventable diagnostic harm. Aim 2 - To explore machine learning techniques that yield robust, accurate models to predict diagnostic errors using EHR-enriched data derived from expert-labeled patient records containing diagnostic errors (from Aim 1).  To our knowledge this is the first ML application in diagnostic error measurement, which could help scale up expert-driven e-trigger development and refinement. Newly developed e-triggers can be pilot tested and implemented at other HCOs, enabling them to create actionable safety-related insights from digital data. Narrative The process of making a diagnosis in emergency departments can be vulnerable to error. To study the risks involved, we will develop strategies to better identify electronic medical records of patients who may have had a diagnostic error in their care. We will test the use of human-derived rule-based algorithms and data-driven machine learning methods that can more accurately and efficiently identify these medical records than other currently available methods used in measurement of patient safety.",Application of a Machine Learning to Enhance e-Triggers to Detect and Learn from Diagnostic Safety Events,10018015,R01HS027363,[' '],AHRQ,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,498859,0.00861201320814954
"Automated Data Collection on Antimicrobial Use in Dogs and Cats in a Tertiary Hospital and Private Practices Judicious antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine is important because improper antimicrobial use can contribute to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens, which makes subsequent use of these drugs less effective in both human and veterinary medicine. There is very little on-the-ground information about veterinary clinicians’ antimicrobial use (AMU) practices in companion animal practice in the US. veterinary medicine. To improve our understanding of antimicrobial use in dogs and cats, we propose to create a nationwide digital surveillance system to collect critical AMU data using existing electronic practice information management systems (PIMS) in collaboration with veterinary industry partners. The system will automatically harvest AMU and patient data from digital PIMS. The proposed system will harvest data collected in routine veterinary examinations from existing PIMS systems and therefore will not require any additional effort from practitioners to participate in the program. Natural language processing, a machine learning method used to classify unstructured text, will be used to review electronic medical records to determine patients’ diagnosis. We aim to prototype the system in our native digital PIMS at North Carolina State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine Teaching hospital. We will then enroll additional private veterinary practices, including general practice, specialty hospitals, and emergency clinics, as sentinels and collect the same detailed PIMS data from a more representative set of clinics. Working closely with the sentinel clinics will provide a deep understanding of how our system operates in private clinics, and in the final stage we aim to expand the fully automated system to PIMS nationwide. The combination of sentinel clinics with the nationwide survey of clinics will create a powerful broad and deep surveillance system for antimicrobial use in veterinary clinics. A broad suite of AMU parameters will be estimated from this data, and the results reported to the FDA in an annual report. Additionally, we will share the data with other researchers through an web-based portal and GitHub repositories. This system will provide the critical data and analysis to understand veterinary AMU in the US.

"Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health care-associated infections (HAIs) affect one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $10 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. Current efforts at detection of HAIs are limited to manual chart review which hinders the generalizability and scalability of HAI detection. My goal in seeking a Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to develop a health services research career as a principal investigator focusing on leveraging novel health information technology (HIT) tools to improve the measurement of surgical health care quality, safety, and effectiveness. To continue my progress towards this goal, the objective of this project is to address the challenges of HAI detection by developing a robust and portable automated HAI surveillance toolkit. This toolkit will combine structured electronic health record (EHR) data with rich information locked in clinical notes using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. Our overall hypothesis is that combining structured variables from the EHR supplemented with NLP will improve our ability to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives for this application, I will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the EHR data elements indicative of postoperative HAIs and evaluate the performance of a novel HAI surveillance algorithm; 2) Identify the presence of postoperative SSIs from clinical notes using an automated portable NLP-based algorithm; 3) Apply user-centered design to create a high fidelity prototype of a surgical quality dashboard incorporating our HAI case detection methodology. This contribution is a significant first step in a continuum of research that utilizes the large amounts of data in the EHR combined with novel HIT methods to improve the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness. This approach is significant because the tools developed in this proposal have potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale. The proposed research is innovative in its approach using a combination of structured and unstructured data in the EHR along with novel machine learning and NLP tools to create a generalizable surveillance toolkit for the detection of HAIs. This proposal is responsive to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-011) specifically addressing the use of HIT to improve quality measurement. I have assembled a mentoring team who all internationally recognized experts with long and successful track records of funding and trainee mentorship. This project will provide the means to place me on a trajectory towards a health services research career focused on improving the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness using novel HIT tools. In summary, my previous training and experience, innovative research plan, high-quality training plan, first-rate mentorship team, and supportive research environment give me the highest likelihood of success to research independence with the proposed K08 award.

"Clinical Text Automatic De-Identification to Support Large Scale Data Reuse and Sharing The adoption of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is growing at a fast pace in the U.S., and this growth results in very large quantities of patient clinical data becoming available in electronic format with tremendous potential but an equally large concern for patient confidentiality breaches. Secondary use of clinical data is essential to fulfill the potential for high quality healthcare, improved healthcare management, and effective clinical research. NIH expects that larger research projects share their research data in a way that protects the confidentiality of research subjects. De-identification of patient data has been proposed as a solution to both facilitate secondary use of clinical data and protect patient data confidentiality. The majority of clinical data found in the EHR is represented as narrative text clinical notes, and de-identification of clinical text is a tedious and costly manual endeavor. Automated approaches based on Natural Language Processing have been implemented and evaluated, allowing for higher accuracy and much faster de- identification than manual approaches. Clinacuity, Inc. proposes to advance a text de-identification system from a prototype to an accurate, adaptable, and robust system, integrated into the research infrastructure at our implementation and testing site (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC), and ready for commercialization efforts. To accomplish this undertaking, we will focus on the following specific aims and related objectives, while continuing to prepare the commercialization of the integrated system, with detailed market analysis, commercial roadmap development, and modern media communication: 1) Enhance the text de-identification system performance, scalability, and quality to produce an enterprise-grade solution ready for deployment; 2) Enable use of structured data for enhanced text de-identification (when structured PII is available) and for complete patient records de-identification (i.e., records combining structured and unstructured data). This aim also includes implementing “one-way” pseudo-identifier cryptographic hashing to enable securely linking already de-identified patient records; 3) Integrate the text de-identification system with a research data capture and management system. This includes implementation of the de-identification system as a secure web service, with standards-based access and integration. This de-identification system has potential commercial applications in clinical research and in healthcare settings. It will improve access to richer, more detailed, and more accurate clinical data (in clinical text) for clinical researchers. It will ease research data sharing (as expected for larger NIH-funded research projects) and help healthcare organizations protect patient data confidentiality. Significant time-savings will also be offered, with a process at least 200-1000 times faster than manual de-identification. The adoption of Electronic Health Record systems is growing at a fast pace in the U.S., and this growth results in very large quantities of patient clinical data becoming available in electronic format, with tremendous potential, but also equally growing concern for patient confidentiality breaches. De-identification of patient data has been proposed as a solution to both facilitate secondary uses of clinical data and protect patient data confidentiality.

It will improve access to richer, more detailed, and more accurate clinical data for clinical researchers, ease research data sharing and help healthcare organizations protect patient data confidentiality. !",Clinical Text Automatic De-Identification to Support Large Scale Data Reuse and Sharing,9908962,R42GM116479,"['Adoption', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communications Media', 'Confidentiality of Patient Information', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Funding', 'Growth', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Improve Access', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Modernization', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Data Privacy', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personally Identifiable Information', 'Phase', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Subjects', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Secure', 'Site', 'South Carolina', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visualization', 'base', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cryptography', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'health care quality', 'health care service organization', 'health care settings', 'health management', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'prototype', 'software development', 'standard measure', 'structured data', 'systems research', 'unstructured data', 'web services']",NIGMS,"CLINACUITY,INC.",R42,2020,759330,0.03044764525939885
"5/6 COMpAAAS U24: Resource in Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) The overall aim of the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/Aids, Alcohol, Aging, & multi- Substance use (COMpAAAS) is to build and disseminate the evidence needed to optimize care for HIV+ experiencing medical harm from alcohol and related substance use, through coordinated, integrated, and externally validated observational, operations research modeling, and intervention studies. Combining and integrating the complimentary expertise of informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, we propose a U24 Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) to support and inform the other COMpAAAS components. This resource will address the complex challenges required to maximize power and minimize bias in analyses addressing consortium-wide questions. Advanced informatics methods supported include natural language processing (NLP), ontologies, database and clinical decision support, and application of vital data management tools for secure data collection, storage, annotation, retrieval, and integration. Advanced epidemiological and statistical methods include time-updated exposure techniques, multiple imputation, propensity score techniques, measurement error correction, and competing risks regression. Routine, but essential, statistical methods include Cox proportional hazards, logistic and linear regression, goodness of fit diagnostics, and agreement/accuracy metrics (kappa, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). The RIB will further leverage the observational and interventional studies, simulation models, and well-coordinated network of cores and workgroups of COMpAAAS with advanced informatics and biostatistical techniques tailored to the particular challenges of large scale, longitudinal data from multiple sources including electronic health records (EHR), clinical interventions, patient self-report, and tissue repositories. Our specific aims are to provide 1) statistical and 2) informatics expertise for COMpAAAS to maximize scientific impact. To accomplish this, we will enhance the design, recruitment, and follow-up of intervention studies, support appropriate design and execution of data analyses and cross cohort collaborations, provide advanced statistical methods plus estimates of alcohol patterns for OR modeling and identify sexual/gender minority populations (CHAMP) from VACS survey data. In addition we will enhance the Consortium Web-Based Laboratory (WBL Portal) informatics infrastructure to support ongoing research design, data collection and management, development and testing of interventions such as clinical decision support and eHealth tools and enhance support for the analysis of textual data. The Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) will extend and enhance the research capacities and productivity among investigators at the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/AIDS, Alcohol, Aging, and multi-Substance use (COMpAAAS).

"Collaborative Research: Statistical Algorithms for Anomaly Detection and Patterns Recognition in Patient Care and Safety Event Reports Project Summary Medical errors have been shown to be the third leading cause of death in the United States. The Institute of Medicine and several state legislatures have recommended the use of patient safety event reporting systems (PSRS) to better understand and improve safety hazards. A patient safety event (PSE) report generally consists of both structured and unstructured data elements. Structured data are pre-defined, fixed fields that solicit specific information about the event. The unstructured data fields generally include a free text field where the reporter can enter a text description of the event. The text descriptions are often a rich data source in that the reporter is not constrained to limited categories or selection options and is able to freely describe the details of the event. The goal of this project is to develop novel statistical methods to analyze unstructured text like patient safety event reports arising in healthcare, which can lead to significant improvements to patient safety and enable timely intervention strategies. We address three problems: (a) Building realistic and meaningful baseline models for near misses, and detecting systematic deterioration of adverse outcomes relative to such baselines; (b) Understanding critical factors that lead to near misses & quantifying severity of outcomes; and (c) Identifying document groups of interest. We will use novel statistical approaches that combine Natural Language Processing with Statistical Process Monitoring, Statistical Networks Analysis, and Spatio-temporal Modeling to build a generalizable toolbox that can address these issues in healthcare. We will also release open source software via R packages & GitHub, which will enable healthcare staff and researchers to execute our methods on their datasets. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased patient volumes and increased patient acuity, leading to an excessive burden on many healthcare facilities across the United States. This greatly increases the risk of patient safety consequences arising from malfunctioning medical equipment or adverse reaction to medication. To ensure patient safety and the highest quality of healthcare during this crisis, we need a rapid response system to model and analyze COVID-specific safety issues at scale, and quickly disseminate the results to healthcare facilities, so that these risks can be mitigated at the point of care. In this supplement, we propose to do this by (a) mining public databases and EHRs to identify devices/medication being used for treating COVID and (b) applying our methods (based on NLP, SPC, and SPM) to understand risks associated with these items. This information will be disseminated nationally to all healthcare facilities so that it can be integrated into the EHR at the point of care to alert clinicians. Project Narrative Estimates of preventable adverse events in healthcare are staggering, and the risk is particularly high for COVID patients due to the rapidly increasing burden on healthcare facilities. Using our algorithms to identify temporal trends and analyze free text narratives from reporting systems can ensure the safety and quality of care for COVID patients by exposing and mitigating possible weaknesses in the care process.",Collaborative Research: Statistical Algorithms for Anomaly Detection and Patterns Recognition in Patient Care and Safety Event Reports,10254593,R01LM013309,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Devices', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'English Language', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Equipment Malfunction', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Interest Group', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Records', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Site', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'cluster computing', 'coronavirus disease', 'dosage', 'hazard', 'health care quality', 'health care service', 'health care service organization', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'point of care', 'response', 'service delivery', 'spatiotemporal', 'structured data', 'trend', 'unstructured data']",NLM,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R01,2020,74963,0.01671487209345402
"Community Surveillance of Coronary Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract  Preventing the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its recurrence, and reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with AMI, remain of significant public health and clinical concern. Monitoring contemporary trends in AMI incidence, treatment, and in-hospital and long-term outcomes is of considerable importance given periodic national updates of treatment guidelines, emphasis on reducing hospital readmissions, and revised definitions and classifications of AMI. Continuously supported by the NHLBI, we have conducted more than 35 years of population-based surveillance of AMI incidence and attack rates, hospital management practices, and the in-hospital and long-term prognosis associated with AMI among residents of central MA hospitalized at all central MA medical centers. We have a highly experienced team of cardiologists, epidemiologists, clinical informatics, and health services researchers who will build on multi- decade long trends (1975-2011) in our principal study endpoints examined previously in this study to the two new study years of patients hospitalized with AMI at all central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017.  To sustain our efforts into the era of electronic medical records (EMRs), and after implementation of the ICD-10 system in 2015, we will develop a new automated AMI surveillance system that efficiently utilizes EMRs by taking advantage of state-of-art natural language processing (NLP) methods that will be compatible with ICD-10 (Aim 1). We will use the new NLP method to streamline traditional chart review-based collection of socio-demographic, clinical, treatment, and hospital and post-discharge outcomes data in patients hospitalized with AMI at all 11 central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017. The data extracted from NLP-streamlined chart reviews will be used to validate and refine the NLP system. Issues related to changes from ICD-9 to ICD- 10 will be carefully addressed. The new NLP-enriched EMR-based surveillance system will eventually be implemented in all participating central MA hospitals. Using the NLP-enriched and EMR-based surveillance data, we will monitor the contemporary clinical epidemiology of AMI, and out-of-hospital deaths due to coronary disease, and changing landscape, over a more than 40 year period (1975-2017) (Aim 2).  The new EMR-based and NLP-enriched system will enhance the population-based surveillance of acute coronary disease. This new system will be cost-effective, more efficient and near-real time, have greater accuracy and precision, and can be readily updated to accommodate changes in information technologies and broadly applicable to other hospital systems. It will support our continued efforts to provide unique community- based observational data on several populations that are often excluded from clinical trials, and that are increasing in numbers, namely the elderly and patients with multiple morbidities. Furthermore, it will generate critical data to inform more national clinical guidelines on the enhanced prevention and management of AMI. If successful, the system can serve as a model and be implemented statewide in MA and elsewhere in the US. Project Narrative  The results of the proposed community-based study will provide data about 40 year trends with regards to the changing magnitude of, and outcomes associated with, heart attacks in residents of a large central New England community. The results of this investigation will also provide contemporary insights on how patients who experience heart attacks in the community are treated by physicians.",Community Surveillance of Coronary Heart Disease,9838247,R01HL135219,"['Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'American', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Case Fatality Rates', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Epidemiologist', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Hospital Administration', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Information Technology', 'Inpatients', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investigation', 'Life Expectancy', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Reperfusion', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Practice Management', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Rural', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health disparity', 'high risk population', 'hospital readmission', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient health information', 'population based', 'prevent', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'surveillance data', 'treatment guidelines', 'trend']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,768763,0.013120617233153779
"Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes PROJECT SUMMARY The advent of surgery to treat congenital heart disease (CHD) in the second half of the 20th century shifted the care paradigm from palliation of disease fatal in infancy to management of lifelong chronic disease through adulthood. There are now more than 1.5 million adults with CHD living in the United States. These patients have a substantial burden of cardiovascular and other medical comorbidities, as well as markedly increased risk for adverse outcomes such as arrhythmia, heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, and premature death. The emergence of this population requires new clinical care models as well as the development of novel research tools and infrastructures to address these patients' unique characteristics and healthcare needs. Adult CHD is characterized by substantial complexity, era-dependent heterogeneity in treatment strategies, and time-varying implications of lifelong disease. This burgeoning population is understudied, and the pathophysiology of the component diseases remains incompletely understood. Billing and other administrative codes available in the electronic medical record are neither sensitive nor specific for CHD diagnosis and do not adequately describe many other salient clinical features. As a result, structured data in large administrative databases are not well suited to studying adults with CHD, even when the goal is simply to identify a cohort of patients with a given diagnosis. This constitutes a major impediment to research efforts and is the primary barrier underlying the limited population-based research performed to date. Adult CHD investigation would benefit immensely from methods to establish harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets. While billing codes are inadequate, the information needed to accurately classify adults with CHD is already available in the electronic medical record in the form of clinical notes, comprised mainly of unstructured (“free”) text. Manual data extraction is laborious, resource intensive, and, therefore, not scalable. We propose to apply cutting-edge natural language processing approaches to unstructured text in the electronic medical record to develop computable classifiers for variables fundamental to the study of adults with CHD. We will use two unique institutional data resources at Boston Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital that are already populated with expert-adjudicated labels to train classifiers for key phenotypes that are poorly defined by administrative codes. These classifiers will be validated in an independent patient cohort at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and tested in new disease-specific risk prediction models. This work promises to accelerate CHD research by massively increasing the scale of the patient cohorts that can be studied and by establishing a foundation for improved evidence-based decision support for this underserved population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Administrative billing codes are inadequate to support research for adults with congenital heart disease, a growing but understudied population with a high burden of medical comorbidities. To advance high quality research towards much-needed innovations in clinical care for these patients, we plan to develop novel methods for the creation of harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets that will expand and enhance collaborative research efforts.",Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes,9946462,R01HL151604,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Heart Septal Defects', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Disease', 'Eisenmenger Complex', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Nomenclature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transposition of Great Vessels', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'administrative database', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computable phenotypes', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data resource', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'large-scale database', 'mortality', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'palliation', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'risk prediction model', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2020,784220,0.004798311070455863
"Transforming Patient Safety Event Data into Actionable Insights through Advanced Analytics Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to develop an innovative algorithms and a software tool to reduce the burden of safety event report classification and analysis so that report data can be transformed to actionable insights. Making safety event data more actionable will support the proactive identification of safety hazards before patients are harmed. We will achieve our research objective through (1) the development of natural language processing algorithms to classify safety event reports into actionable medication error categories; (2) the development of prototype software that will automatically categorize and visualize safety event reports to support trend identification; and (3) the pilot testing of prototype software with hospital and patient safety organization safety analysts. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, including computer science, specifically regarding information retrieval and data classification. Our research team includes patient safety organizations and collaboration with the computer science department at Georgetown University. The proposal is directly aligned with AHRQ’s priority area of making health care safer. Contributions from this research will include an expansion of our understanding of natural language processing and its application to categorizing clinical text, advances in visual analytics, and the development of a software tool to support patient safety analysts. The outputs of this research will serve both healthcare organizations and patient safety organizations allowing them to more efficiently and effectively analyze safety report data.

"National Infrastructure for Standardized and Portable EHR Phenotyping Algorithms PROJECT SUMMARY With the rapidly growing adoption of patient electronic health record systems (EHRs) due to Meaningful Use, and linkage of EHRs to research biorepositories, evaluating the suitability of EHR data for clinical and translational research is becoming ever more important, with ramifications for genomic and observational research, clinical trials, and comparative effectiveness studies. A key component for identifying patient cohorts in the EHR is to define inclusion and exclusion criteria that algorithmically select sets of patients based on stored clinical data. This process is commonly referred to, as “EHR-driven phenotyping” is time-consuming and tedious due to the lack of a widely accepted and standards-based formal information model for defining phenotyping algorithms. To address this overall challenge, the proposed project will design, build and promote an open-access community infrastructure for standards-based development and sharing of phenotyping algorithms, as well as provide tools and resources for investigators, researchers and their informatics support staff to implement and execute the algorithms on native EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of patient cohorts for clinical and genomic research is a costly and time-consuming process. This bottleneck adversely affects public health by delaying research findings, and in some cases by making research costs prohibitively high. To address this issue, leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) for identifying patient cohorts has become an increasingly attractive option.

"Maternal Morbidity and Mortality: Risk Factors, Early Detection and Personalized Intervention PROJECT ABSTRACT  In the U.S., from 2011 to 2014, 7,208 maternal fatalities, with the trend worsening year-on-year (CDC, 2016). In addition to the 700+ fatalities, at least 50,000 woman experienced life-threatening complications, annually. According to CDC (2019) for every fatality, 70 more women suffer avoidable, traumatic complications as a result of pregnancy.  Medstar Health Research Institute and Invaryant, Inc, propose the evaluation of a cardiac risk assessment tool for pregnant and postpartum women; this tool updates automatically directly from patient medical records; wearable devices; and patient surveys. Success implies disruptive improvement in women's health. Proposed research involves three key elements: technology, data, and social determinants of health (SDOH) using geospatial mapping of patient locations. Technology: Study technology shall be based on the Invaryant Health Platform (IHP), a technology that automatically ingests data, from medical records, wearable devices, and other sources using proprietary AI based interoperability technology called Mesh-Complex Method Exchange (Mesh-CMX). We propose using the IHP in conjunction with novel prototype-level technology, namely Healthy Outcomes for all Pregnancy Experiences-Cardiovascular-risk Assessment Technology (HOPE-CAT) and the Invaryant machine learning technologies to monitor the patient, based on signals, out-of-range “trip-wires”, and trends in the mother's health data that merit medical intervention. By extending the proof of concept into an early commercial version of the software, and integrating it to the IHP which will automatically update changes in the patient's medical record, we will provide an “early warning” system for mothers and their providers. Data: The study will be tested on patients' medical records using the MedStar's Analytics Platform (MAP), a registry of over 5 Million unique patients. The tool will subsequently have the potential to be leveraged to over 90 million medical records for the MedStar and Cerner hospital systems, distilled down to meet specific eligibility criteria including, gender, age, race, pregnancy and medical outcomes. A second phase of this project would take the findings from the retrospective study (this grant request) and use the technology within the Medstar hospital system, to validate the efficacy of the findings in a “real-world setting”. Using our proprietary AI technology, we will compare each mother's progress against a cohort of retrospective data to enhance diagnostics and provide real-time feedback to caregivers and patients. Geospatial mapping: Mapping the patient medical record and the health information to their social setting is vital for understanding the underlying social constructs that affect the health of mothers in different regions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Medstar Health Research Institute and Invaryant, Inc. propose the evaluation of a cardiovascular risk assessment tool (HOPE-CAT) for pregnant and postpartum women utilizing technology, data, and social determinants of health (SDoH) with geospatial mapping. HOPE- CAT, in conjunction with Invaryant's health platform and machine learning technologies, will monitor the patient based on signals, out-of-range ""trip-wires"", and trends in health data.

"Improving Patient Safety and Clinician Cognitive Support Through eMAR Redesign Project Summary/Abstract Written The objective of the proposed research is to reduce the patient safety hazards associated with electronic medication administration records (eMARs) by, (1) understanding current usability and safety gaps, and (2) creating design and development documents, wireframes, and prototypes to serve as the foundation for future eMARs that will eliminate these gaps. In particular, we focus on communication and information flow challenges between nurses, pharmacists, and physicians during medication administration and use of the eMAR. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-16-009). We will develop a broad understanding of usability and safety hazards associated with eMARs by analyzing a large dataset of 1.7 million patient safety event reports and detailed medication error related narratives. We will then conduct heuristic analyses of current eMARs, and interviews and observations of physicians, nurses, and pharmacists. These data will serve to inform the development of eMAR design documents, wireframes, and prototypes as the foundation for future development. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health information technology (health IT), informatics, and data science. Our research team includes physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and human factors engineers, and experts in natural language processing. In addition, our partnerships include a patient safety organization and a health IT vendor. The proposal addresses fundamental aspects of the call for proposals by providing new insights on the safety of health IT and improves current practices by developing use cases and new prototypes for immediate use by healthIT vendors. Contributions from this research will include a fundamental understanding of the role of health IT during medication administration with a focus on communication and information flow, design, development and testing documents for vendors and providers, and eMAR wireframes and prototypes to improve development. Our research will also provide organizations like the Office of the National Coordinator with medication related test scenarios to assess current health IT systems. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health because it applies the sciences of human factors and informatics to improve the usability and safety of the electronic medication administration records (eMARs), which will ultimately improve patient care. Patient safety event report data will be analyzed to identify usability and safety hazards in eMARs, and interviews and observations will be conducted to identify clinician needs. Based on this knowledge eMAR design documents, wireframes, and prototypes will be developed, tested, and disseminated with the goal of improving communication and information flow to reduce medication related errors.",Improving Patient Safety and Clinician Cognitive Support Through eMAR Redesign,9912124,R01HS025136,[' '],AHRQ,MEDSTAR HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,398492,0.02434788430870935
"Clinical and Translational Science Award PROJECT SUMMARY: COMBATCOVID The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected every corner of the globe and has redefined healthcare throughout the United States. COVID-19 cases in the New York City tri-state area have reached an extraordinarily high number and have quickly become the epicenter region of the crisis in the United States. In New York State alone, there are over 372,000 confirmed cases as of June 1, 2020. NYU Langone Health (NYULH) has been particularly hard hit, with more than 8,100 COVID-19 hospitalizations to date. In response, the entire clinical research community is marshalling resources in an attempt to improve our understanding of how the virus spreads, how it infects various tissues in the body, which patients are more susceptible to infection and fatal outcomes, which therapeutics improve symptoms and survival, whether the immune response confers long-lasting protection against reinfection, and many other crucially important questions. The complexity of the development of this disease and unpredictability of progression into severity, as well as the variety of phenotypic outcomes observed during and post COVID-19, pose major challenges in understanding, predicting, preventing, managing and treating this disease and its sequelae. Answers to these challenges can only be achieved through the comprehensive analysis of a significantly high number of COVID cases. Given how recent and unknown this disease is, and its inherent epidemic nature, there is a limited number of cases at individual medical institutions. The limitation of number of cases per institution becomes even more relevant when isolating subpopulations with specific health conditions and across the lifespan. This proposed study will aim to overcome the above-mentioned challenges by supporting the formation of a consortium comprising multiple medical institutions in the U.S.: COMBATCOVID (Consortium for Multisite Biomedical Analytics and Trials on COVID-19). COMBATCOVID will bring together electronic health records (EHR) data from multiple participating institutions into a shared centralized database. As part of the COMBATCOVID effort, biorepository data of COVID-19 patients collected by some of the participating institutions will also be shared and linked to the respective EHR data. The COMBATCOVID consortium will be responsible for transferring EHR data pertaining to participating institutions interested in contributing EHR data to the N3C database. PROJECT NARRATIVE: COMBATCOVID The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected every corner of the globe and has redefined healthcare throughout the United States. To adequately understand the virus much more data is needed, necessitating sharing of data across multiple institutions. The COMBATCOVID (Consortium for Multisite Biomedical Analytics and Trials on COVID-19) initiative will support regional and national efforts by forming a consortium comprising multiple medical institutions in the U.S. to create a shared centralized database of COVID-related EHR data.",Clinical and Translational Science Award,10183901,UL1TR001445,"['2019-nCoV', 'Affect', 'Area', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coronavirus', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Marshal', 'Medical', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumonia', 'Procedures', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States', 'Upper respiratory tract', 'Venous', 'Viral Pneumonia', 'Virus', 'biobank', 'central database', 'cohort', 'coronavirus disease', 'data sharing', 'demographics', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'health data', 'improved', 'interest', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'member', 'pandemic disease', 'prevent', 'racial minority', 'response', 'structured data', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unstructured data', 'venous thromboembolism']",NCATS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,UL1,2020,768511,0.015821262641729016
"Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: The reports of side effects on clinical trials describe expected toxicities of chemotherapy. However, these side effects, also called adverse events, are globally under-reported on trials, which means that clinicians do not have an accurate sense of adverse event rates. In the current system, adverse events are identified through time-consuming, manual medical record review. This study aims to develop a system that uses electronic medical record data to capture complex adverse events of chemotherapy for pediatric cancer and to prove that this method is more accurate than the current adverse event reporting system. The specific aims of this application are to 1) develop algorithms to identify 10 complex adverse events using electronic medical record data from children treated for acute leukemia at two large children's hospitals, 2) compare the accuracy of this new method to that of the current system, and 3) demonstrate the utility of electronic adverse event capture in answering clinical questions by defining the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury. Methods: This study will use data from 1900 children with acute leukemia treated at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) or the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) from 2002 through 2017. Algorithms will be developed to identify adverse events by extracting electronic medical record data at CHOP. Once finalized, the algorithms will be tested at TCH. Using chart abstraction data as the gold standard, the accuracy of electronic ascertainment and of trial adverse event reports will determined, and the relative accuracy of each method will be compared. Lastly, algorithms will extract creatinine results from the electronic medical record and the incidence of acute kidney injury will be determined for each leukemia type and by chemotherapy regimen. Risk factors for acute kidney injury will be explored. Career Goals and Environment: With the support of this K07 award, the applicant, Tamara P. Miller, MD, MSCE, will learn how to use electronic medical record data for clinical research, obtain formal training in clinical informatics and implementation science, develop expertise in clinical trial design, and improve her knowledge of pediatric oncology and skills in scientific writing. To complete these training goals, Dr. Miller has assembled an experienced, complementary, and nurturing mentoring team led by her primary mentor, Richard Aplenc, MD, PhD. Her training plan includes formal coursework in informatics, tutorials, national conferences, and research progress and writing groups. She will benefit from the outstanding depth of resources and opportunities at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania. Her long-term goal is to integrate the novel system of adverse event ascertainment she creates into pediatric oncology trials and to use the accurate datasets she develops to answer clinically important questions. With this award, Dr. Miller will be well-positioned to transition to her goal of an independent clinical research career focused on improving adverse event reporting and supportive care practices in pediatric oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with cancer experience significant side effects from their treatments, but these side effects are under- reported on clinical trials and no work has been done to improve the current system of side effect reporting. This study will create a new system of identifying and reporting side effects that is more accurate and efficient than the current system. The results of this research will provide clinicians, patients and their families with a true understanding of potential side effects of therapies used to treat childhood cancer.",Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials,9994848,K07CA211956,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Acute leukemia', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Child', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncology Group', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxicity due to chemotherapy', 'Training', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'data pipeline', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'leukemia', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'oncology trial', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'side effect', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K07,2020,169884,0.003315425406600145
