"MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Purpose/Hypothesis: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes substantial social, economic, and health burden.1 For individuals with motor incomplete SCI, some basic ability to stand or walk is expected during the recovery process,2 and this is a top priority in rehabilitative programs.3 However, establishing a prognosis for recovering community walking ability is extremely difficult.4 Within 72 hours after SCI,5 edema develops within the damaged spinal cord. This edema is a hallmark of spinal cord injury, expressed as signal hyperintensity using T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).6 Correlations between the sagittal length of this spinal cord edema and walking ability are generally poor.7,8 However, advanced but available high resolution axial T2-weighted MRI to quantify spinal cord edema in people in the acute stage of SCI may improve prediction of walking ability.9,10 The early clinical management and targeted rehabilitation of these individuals could be drastically enhanced, optimizing recovery and rehabilitation outcomes. The main objective of this research project is to use early axial spinal cord MRI sequences as neuroprognostic biomarkers to improve the prediction of residual motor function. This objective will be realized by the implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish to what extent the axial damage ratio biomarker, measured by high-resolution axial T2-weighted structural imaging, can predict residual function in persons with SCI. Previously-collected axial T2-weighted spinal cord structural MRI data of 200 people with SCI from the US Model SCI System at Craig Hospital will be used to quantify cord damage. This metric will be related to the primary 1-year status-post injury outcome measures, which are clinical records of walking ability and function. Multivariate statistical analyses will be applied to create exploratory models to determine the prognostic value of the MRI measures. We hypothesize that the axial damage ratio can be used in the acute stage as an accurate and objective neuroprognostic biomarker of residual motor function. Aim 2: To identify the relationship between damage to specific spinal cord regions and specific motor and sensory deficits. MRI data from Aim 1 will be used. Spinal cord regional damage analysis will be related to right and left upper and lower extremity motor and sensory scores. Correlational statistical analyses will be applied to analyze relationships between specific tract damage and motor/sensory deficits. We hypothesize that damage to descending lateral corticospinal motor regions is related to ipsilesional motor deficits, and that similar findings exist for ascending sensory regions and sensory deficits. For both Aims, we will compare our manual damage quantification to our machine learning approach to automatically detect spinal cord damage. Aim 3: Develop, test, and distribute a machine-learning based analysis pipeline for spinal cord damage measures. We will use functions included in the Spinal Cord Toolbox and the open-source NiftyNet deep-learning platform to develop the machine-learning based analysis pipeline. The processing steps will include spinal cord detection, spinal cord damage segmentation, registration to the spinal cord template, and the calculation and output of the axial damage ratio and regional damage biomarkers. Significance: Successful completion of these Aims will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” The significance of this outcome relates directly to improving the clinical management of SCI. This research may inform clinicians, patients, and families, regarding the percentage chance of regaining walking ability. The healthcare team will be able to determine, early-on, which people will optimally respond to locomotor training. This work will significantly improve the prognosis for recovery of walking and specific motor/sensory function based on early imaging of the damaged spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this research project is to use early axial MRI measures of spinal cord damage as objective biomarkers to improve the prediction of walking recovery and specific motor return of individuals following SCI. This research will provide patients with a quantified sense of expectations regarding their chances of walking recovery, and will help guide the healthcare team on the best options for clinical management and rehabilitation (i.e. focusing on neuroplasticity and restoration of walking versus compensatory strategies). Ultimately, this research aims to improve the lives and wellbeing of those suffering from spinal cord injury. Successful completion of this research will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” ! 1!",MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury,9674165,R03HD094577,"['Acute', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Correlation Studies', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Event', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Length', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Location', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Team', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rogaine', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord damage', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Testing', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Walking', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dorsal column', 'early detection biomarkers', 'expectation', 'functional independence', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'motor deficit', 'motor function recovery', 'motor recovery', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'prospective', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'restoration', 'secondary outcome', 'social', 'spinal cord imaging']",NICHD,REGIS UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,96034,0.03974604758081989
"Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of tetraplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop methods to artificially activate and control paralyzed muscles with electrodes implanted in muscles. This effort will contribute to the restoration of voluntary limb movements in individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke.",Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation,9699018,R01NS102259,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Digit structure', 'Elbow', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Error Sources', 'Experimental Models', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Forearm', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Intramuscular', 'Joints', 'Lifting', 'Limb structure', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle Fatigue', 'Output', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Space', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Quadriplegia', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'artificial neural network', 'awake', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'design', 'experience', 'finger movement', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'grasp', 'hand grasp', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuroprosthesis', 'nonhuman primate', 'response', 'restoration', 'robotic device', 'scapula']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2019,329650,0.0818637926074354
"Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of this R01 project is to develop an automated assessment system that can capitalize on state of the art sensing technologies and machine learning algorithms to enable accurate and early detection of infants at risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities. In the USA, 1 in 10 infants are born at risk for these disabilities. For children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, early treatment in the first year of life improves long-term outcomes. However, we are currently held back by inadequacies of available clinical tests to measure and predict impairment. Existing tests are hard to administer, require specialized training, and have limited long- term predictive value. There is a critical need to develop an objective, accurate, easy-to-use tool for the early prediction of long-term physical disability. The field of pediatrics and infant development would greatly benefit from a quantitative score that would correlate with existing clinical measures used today to detect movement impairments in very young infants. To realize a new generation of tests that will be easy to administer, we will obtain large datasets of infants playing in an instrumented gym or simply being recorded while moving in a supine posture. Video and sensor data analyses will convert movement into feature vectors based on our knowledge of the problem domain. Our approach will use machine learning to relate these feature vectors to currently recommended clinical tests or other ground truth information. The power of this design is that algorithms can utilize many aspects of movement to produce the relevant scores. Our preliminary data allows us to lay the following aims: 1)Aim 1: To assess concurrent validity of a multimodal instrumented gym with existing clinical tools. Here, using 150 infants (75 with early brain injury and 75 controls), we will focus on converting data from an instrumented gym into estimates of the standard clinical tests; 2)Aim 2: To develop a computer vision-based algorithm to quantify infant motor performance from single camera video. Here using video data from 1200 infants (400 with early brain injury, 400 preterm without early brain injury, 400 controls), plus those gathered from Aim 1 and Aim 3, we will extract pose data from single-camera video recordings and convert these into kinematic features and relevant scores needed to classify infant movement; 3)Aim3: To discover the features related to long-term motor development. Here we will convert data collected longitudinally from 50 infants (25 with early brain injury and 25 controls) using both instrumented gym and video recordings into estimates standard clinical tests change over time and track features over developmental timescales. These three aims spearhead the use of real world behavior for movement scoring. Our aims will bring us closer to a universal non-invasive test for early detection of neurodevelopmental disabilities and lay the groundwork for long-term prediction of disability. But above all, it promises to scale to infants worldwide, producing an affordable tool to aid in infant health assessment. NARRATIVE Increased survival rates of medically fragile infants lead to an increased number of children with functional impairments later in life. Early detection of motor delays or impairments provides the opportunity for early treatment which improves health outcomes. This study will use state of the art sensors combined with machine learning approaches to develop objective, accurate, easy-to-use tools for the early scoring of deficits and lays the foundation for the early prediction of physical disability.",Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability,9765496,R01HD097686,"['Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Asphyxia', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Birth History', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Educational Status', 'Effectiveness', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand Strength', 'Health', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Infant Health', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Predictive Value', 'Premature Birth', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Seizures', 'Supination', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toy', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'base', 'critical period', 'design', 'disability', 'drug abuse in pregnancy', 'early screening', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'infant monitoring', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'multimodality', 'neonatal stroke', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel strategies', 'pressure', 'prognostic tool', 'recruit', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skeletal', 'tool', 'vector']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,711064,-0.013172249093816549
"Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots PROJECT SUMMARY This application will result in a technological platform that re-empowers persons with severe paralysis, by allowing them to independently control a wide spectrum of robotic actions. Severe paralysis is devastating, and chronic—and reliance on caregivers is persistent. Assistive machines such as wheelchairs and robotic arms offer a groundbreaking path to independence: where control over their environment and interactions is returned to the person.  However, to operate complex machines like robotic arms and hands typically poses a difﬁcult learning challenge and requires complex control signals—and the commercial control interfaces accessible to persons with severe paralysis (e.g. sip-and-puff, switch-based head arrays) are not adequate. As a result, assistive robotic arms remain largely inaccessible to those with severe paralysis—arguably the population who would beneﬁt from them most.  The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. Control interfaces that generate a unique map from a user's body motions to control signals for a machine offer a customized interaction, however these interfaces have only been used to issue low-dimensional (2-D) control signals whereas more complex machines require higher-dimensional (e.g. 6-D) signals. We propose an approach that leverages robotics autonomy and machine learning in order to aid the end-user in learning how to issue effective higher-dimensional control signals through body motions. Speciﬁcally, initially the human issues a lower- dimensional control signal and robotics autonomy is used to bridge the gap by taking over whatever is not covered by the human's control signal. Help from the robotics autonomy is then progressively scaled back, automatically, to cover fewer and fewer control dimensions as the user becomes more skilled.  The ﬁrst piece to our approach deals with how to extract control signals from the human, using the body-machine interface. The development and optimization of decoding procedures for controlling a robotic arm using residual body motions will be addressed under Speciﬁc Aim 1. The second piece to our approach deals with how to interpret control signals from a human within a paradigm that shares control between the human and robotics autonomy. To identify which shared-control formulations most effectively utilize the human's control signals will be the topic of Speciﬁc Aim 2. The ﬁnal piece to our approach deals with how to adapt the shared-control paradigm so that more control is transferred to the human over time. This adaptation is necessary for the human's learning process, since the goal in the end is for the human to be able to fully control the robotic arm him/herself, and will be assessed under Speciﬁc Aim 3.  At the completion of this project, tetraplegic end-users will be able to operate a robotic arm using their residual body motions, through an interface that both promotes the use of residual body motions (and thus also recovery of motor skill) and adapts with the human as their abilities change over time. By leveraging adaptive robotics autonomy, our application moreover provides a safe mechanism to facilitate learning how to operate the robotic platform. Frequently the more severe a person's motor impairment, the less able they are to operate the very assistive machines, like powered wheelchairs and robotic arms, which might enhance their quality of life. The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means, through non-invasive technologies, to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. We propose and study an approach that leverages robot machine learning and autonomy in order to facilitate human motor learning of how to operate a robotic arm using a customized interface, in order to make powered assisted manipulation more accessible to people with severe paralysis. 1",Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots,9773039,R01EB024058,"['3-Dimensional', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Residual state', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Shoulder', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal cord injured survivor', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'arm', 'assistive robot', 'base', 'body-machine interface', 'brain machine interface', 'empowerment', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'n-dimensional', 'novel strategies', 'physical conditioning', 'psychologic', 'robot control', 'sensor', 'two-dimensional']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2019,329494,0.045231651584382034
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9675333,R01NS063399,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incentives', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning ability', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,363758,0.02701671825480859
"Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors Project Summary Behavior is movement, and the effective and efficient execution of movement has served as a fundamental evolutionary force shaping the form and function of the nervous system. Control of the forelimbs to interact with the world is one of the most essential achievements of the mammalian motor system, yet unfortunately these behaviors are particularly vulnerable to disease and injury. The execution of skilled limb movements requires the continuous refinement of motor output across dozens of muscles, suggesting the existence of feedback pathways that enable rapid adjustments. The temporal delays of peripheral pathways, however, suggest that sensory feedback alone cannot explain the sophistication of online motor control. In principle, a more rapid source of feedback would be to convey copies of motor commands internally to the cerebellum to generate predictions of motor outcome, reducing dependence on delayed sensory information. Yet putative copy circuits have been difficult to isolate experimentally, leaving their contributions to movement unclear. Mouse genetic tools offer a means to explore a diverse class of spinal interneurons as a neural substrate for internal copies. Cervical propriospinal neurons (PNs) receive descending motor command input and extend bifurcating axons; one branch projects to forelimb motor neurons and the other projects to the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN), a major cerebellar input, providing an anatomically straightforward means to convey motor copies internally. Yet how diverse classes of PN-LRN circuits are organized and how they each contribute to distinct elements of limb behavior remain unclear. Complicating the problem, the field lacks robust ways for deconstructing complex limb movements into component elements (e.g. reaching, grasping, postural control), and objective means for quantifying these behaviors in mice. Hypothesis: Discrete classes of PN circuits convey distinct types of spinal motor copy information to the LRN, each necessary for separate aspects of forelimb control; this functional logic can be resolved with more quantitative, high-resolution and standardized behavioral assays. To test this overarching hypothesis, Aim 1 uses molecular-genetic circuit mapping approaches and single-cell RNA- sequencing to define the anatomical and molecular organization of four classes of PN-LRN circuits. Identifying the fine-grained structure of these diverse pathways will be essential for establishing how internal copies are conveyed to the cerebellum to control forelimb behavior. Aim 2 addresses the need for more sensitive and unbiased behavioral tools by developing novel assays of discrete elements of forelimb behavior and machine learning approaches for automated quantification of forelimb kinematics. Finally, Aim 3 merges these novel behavioral approaches with intersectional genetic tools, electrophysiological recording and circuit-specific perturbation to functionally dissect PN-LRN circuits and define their modular contributions to dexterous limb control. Ultimately, these studies will yield insight into the function of internal copy circuits throughout the nervous system, and help to lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits. Project Narrative In addition to promoting basic science investigation of motor function, this work can impact the study of motor dysfunction. Skilled movements of the arm and hand are particularly susceptible to disease and injury of the motor system, raising the need for a better understanding of motor circuit organization and more informative strategies for studying the behaviors these circuits control. Merging molecular-genetic tools with novel behavioral approaches will offer a more detailed and comprehensive approach to studying movement, helping to provide greater insight into the neural basis of motor deficits as well as more effective ways to restore or replace lost motor function.","Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors",9739115,R01NS111479,"['Ablation', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Axon', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebellum', 'Cervical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Forelimb', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Limb structure', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Rabies', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Viral', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'insight', 'intersectionality', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'molecular subtypes', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory feedback', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,R01,2019,579461,0.052866838994836685
"SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home We propose to develop a novel, distributed sensor platform that continuously assesses movement in the background of one's life with the goal of helping people age in place and avoid expensive and lengthy hospitalizations. On the one hand, the platform will combine measurements from a heterogeneous and  complementary set of inertial, physiological , and vision sensors with state-of-the-art techniques from robotics and machine learning, together with clinically informed dynamic models of human motion. On the other hand, the platform will use these data to target the prompt detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty, with the goal of facilitating personalized caregiver alerts if a decline in functional status is detected. Moreover, the platform will provide context-aware control inputs to facilitate unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies in the home. This project has three main thrusts: assessment, control, and home intervention. In the assessment component, our work will extend well-proven techniques of multi-modal sensor fusion for mapping and localization of robots to home-based movement monitoring and intervention. The novelty of this work lies in the tight integration of machine learning modules for real-time activity recognition and movement dysfunction diagnosis. In the control component, our work will push the boundaries of what is possible with current powered assistive devices by developing novel control mechanisms that take advantage of the new capabilities provided by the estimation component (e.g., adapting control to changes in activities and environmental contexts). In the home intervention component, we will collect data that will refine the sensing and control algorithms and involve caregivers in alerts. A patient-in-the-loop development approach will be utilized where domain-informed protocols will generate the data necessary to train and evaluate our system, both in the clinic and in the home. By enabling timely detection of movement dysfunction and facilitating unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies, this foundational technology has paradigm-disrupting potential to prevent the onset of frailty and alter the treatment options for frail individuals. In parallel, the estimation component of the system could be used in clinical settings to automate and standardize time-intensive and highly subjective functional movement assessments, allowing more accurate diagnoses while freeing clinicians for other important tasks. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Frail older adults constitute the sickest, most expensive, and fastest growing segment of the US population. Home-based technologies that facilitate aging in place and reduce high-cost, hospital- and institution-based interventions are desperately needed. Our proposed distributed sensor platform has the potential to address this need by enabling the timely detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty and proactive caregiver and technological interventions that can delay, or prevent, mobility loss. n/a","SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home",9976771,R01AG067394,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging in place', 'base', 'cost', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'functional status', 'human model', 'loss of function', 'multimodality', 'neuroprosthesis', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2019,299863,0.011308783527312396
"Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila The goal of this project is to study the cellular basis of active sensation. A crucial function of all nervous systems is to distinguish between sensory stimuli originating from the external world and that generated by our own movements. This task relies on brain circuits that integrate sensory information with an internal model, or expectation, of self-generated movements. The complexity and intractability of many models used to study active sensing means that translating insights from these studies to failures of normal nervous system function remains challenging. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) actively move their antennae, and my recent work has elucidated a neural circuit that processes mechanosensory information from the antenna. Given the power of Drosophila as a genetic model organism, this project aims to develop the neural circuits controlling and sensing antennal movement as a cellular model for studying principles of active sensing. In the K99 (mentored) portion of this grant, I will identify the cellular location at which self- versus externally-generated mechanosensory signals become differentially represented in the brain. I will make electrophysiological recordings of intracellular activity from 2nd and 3rd order mechanosensory neurons and compare how these two populations encode passive and active movements of the antennae. I will distinguish between these two types of movements using machine learning analysis of simultaneously recorded video data. For the R00 (independent) phase, I will use optogenetics and immunohistochemistry to identify motor neurons that control antennal movement. I will then ask where input from motor neurons impinge on the sensory circuit. Finally, I will test the role of active antennal movements in behavior. By perturbing active antennal movements in freely walking and flying flies, I will directly test how these movements enable different behavioral tasks such as wind orientation and obstacle avoidance. Together, these experiments will identify the cellular basis for active sensing in Drosophila, and their role in goal- oriented behaviors. The goal of the proposed research is to understand the principles that permit nervous systems to distinguish external from internally-generated sensory stimuli. Here I propose to develop a small circuit model of this process using the antennal mechanosensory system of the fruit fly. The insights gained from a tractable genetic circuit model will enable us to understand how these mechanisms fail in disease, supporting the BRAIN Initiative’s mission to understand the neural circuit basis of a critical brain function.",Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila,9871513,K99NS114179,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Closure by clamp', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environmental Wind', 'Esthesia', 'Failure', 'Fingers', 'Flying body movement', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Insecta', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanoreceptors', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Odors', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Stimulus', 'Study models', 'System', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Walking', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'goal oriented behavior', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensory stimulus', 'tool']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2019,134007,0.012319520212556272
"Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits Project Summary  Of the diverse features of the mammalian motor repertoire, skilled limb movements have become some of the more impressive and indispensable ways of interacting with the environment. The susceptibility of these movements to neurodegenerative disease and injury underscores the need for a better understanding of how neural circuits orchestrate these dexterous behaviors. This goal demands sophisticated experimental scrutiny at both neural and behavioral levels, and while the emergence of genetic tools for monitoring and manipulating neural circuits in mice has been transformative, the development of motor behavioral assays has not kept pace. Typically, a single behavioral test is applied to the question at hand, precluding a more comprehensive description of why relevant neural circuits have evolved their particular anatomical and functional attributes. Moreover, in the study of limb motor control, primate-inspired behavioral paradigms tend to be applied to the mouse by default, risking neglect of a more complete and naturalistic account of motor circuit function.  Ethology emphasizes an unbiased study of behavior under natural conditions. This proposal describes an ethological approach for the quantification and categorization of skilled limb movements in mice, enabling a depth and breadth of behavioral analysis that more closely aligns with the complexity of the underlying neural circuits. Several complementary approaches for unbiased behavioral quantification of mouse limb movements in enriched environments will be developed in parallel: a set of optical techniques enabling automated three- dimensional reconstruction of limb and digit posture and trajectory; and an approach that leverages advances in the miniaturization of motion sensors for camera-free limb tracking that can be integrated seamlessly with neural and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Through iterative refinement, this multifaceted strategy should highlight the strengths and mitigate potential drawbacks of each tracking method, providing a suite of complementary quantitative tools. Kinematic, kinetic, EMG and neural data collected across diverse behavioral contexts will be used to guide machine learning-based classification of natural structure in limb movements and in their underlying neural circuits. As a proving ground for how these naturalistic behavioral analyses can be integrated with the genetic dissection of neural circuit function, a set of molecularly defined motor circuits will be probed using novel optogenetic tools that permit selective inhibition at defined axon collateral terminals. This combination of projection specific genetic perturbation and ethologically driven behavioral analyses will provide a powerful lens through which to view the fine-grained functional organization of mammalian motor circuits. More generally, this merging of molecular and systems neuroscience approaches will offer a novel way to explore and compare fine motor control across species, equipping the field with a more comprehensive and standardized approach to study skilled behavior, and helping lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of behavioral deficits associated with neural circuit dysfunction. Project Narrative Skilled limb movements play a central role in mammalian behavior, from the seemingly mundane to the astoundingly athletic – yet little is known about how specific neural circuits orchestrate limb motor output to ensure precision and dexterity. To identify the neural basis of skilled behaviors, a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of natural limb movements in mice is needed to take better advantage of the powerful genetic accessibility of this model system. The ability to track and define these skilled, natural movements will enable a more sensitive and empirical exploration of the neural control of behavior, and should lay the groundwork for more effective diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits caused by disease or injury.",Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits,9835325,DP2NS105555,"['Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Injury', 'Kinetics', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'dexterity', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'kinematics', 'lens', 'limb movement', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP2,2019,99879,0.009243904705770137
"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning. Deep understanding of sensory-motor systems will aid in development of new treatment modalities for diseases that impair motor function, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. n/a","CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling",9730639,R01NS100049,"['Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Huntington Disease', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'control theory', 'cost', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional plasticity', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mathematical analysis', 'medical schools', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'sensorimotor system', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,205290,0.024624673155081368
"Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit Abstract The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated, well-timed movements. The cerebellar cortex seems to have a particular role in learning to time movements. Since the 1960's and 70's, we have known the architecture of the cerebellar microcircuit, but most analyses of cerebellar function during behavior have focused on Purkinje cells. Here, we propose to investigate the cerebellar cortex at an entirely new level by asking how the full cerebellar microcircuit – mossy fiber, granule cells, Golgi cells, molecular layer interneurons, and Purkinje cells – performs neural computations during motor behavior and motor learning. We strive to “crack” the circuit by identifying all elements, recording their electrical activity during movement and learning, and reconstructing a neural circuit model that reproduces the biological data. We will use three established learning systems that all can learn predictive timing: classical conditioning of the eyelid response (mice), predictive timing of forelimb movements (mice), and direction learning in smooth pursuit eye movements (monkeys). Our proposal has six key features. First, optogenetics (in mice) will link the discharge of different cerebellar interneurons during movement and learning to their molecular cell types. Second, a machine-learning clustering analysis (in mice and monkeys) will find analogies among the cell populations recorded in our three preparations and will classify neurons according to their putative cell types based on recordings of many parameters of non-Purkinje cells during movement and motor learning. Third, multi- contact electrodes will allow us to record simultaneously from multiple neighboring single neurons and compute spike-timing cross-correlograms (CCGs) to identify the sign of connections; we also will look for changes in CCGs that provide evidence of specific sites of plasticity during learning. Fourth, gCAMP imaging of the granule cell layer will reveal the temporal structure of inputs to the cerebellar microcircuit, and determine whether those inputs are modified in relation to motor learning. Fifth, a model neural network with realistic cerebellar architecture will reveal a single set of model parameters that will transform the measured inputs to the cerebellum in our three movement systems to the measured responses of all neurons in the cerebellar cortex. Sixth, the model will elucidate how mechanisms of synaptic and cellular plasticity at different sites in the cerebellar microcircuit work together to cause motor learning. Project Narrative The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated and well-timed movements. A better understanding of how the cerebellar circuit works and learns will be important for improving human health in cases of stroke, neuro-degenerative motor disease, developmental motor disorders, and adult movement disorders.",Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit,9814049,R01NS112917,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brush Cell', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar cortex structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collection', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Forelimb', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Indium-111', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Smooth Pursuit', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of molecular layer of cerebellar cortex', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'classical conditioning', 'commune', 'design', 'experimental study', 'eyeblink conditioning', 'eyelid conditioning', 'granule cell', 'improved', 'learned behavior', 'mossy fiber', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,1290521,0.054832678140987995
"An Intracortical Brain-Computer Interface Model for High Efficiency Development of Closed-Loop Neural Decoding Algorithms An intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) is used to record electrical signals directly from a person's brain, predict their intention from those signals, then control an assistive device (e.g., a computer cursor, prosthetic limb, or powered wheelchair) according to those intentions. This technology enables severely paralyzed people to interact with the world. However, designing robust algorithms to extract intent from recordings of single neurons is extremely challenging, in large part because of the very limited access to humans, or even monkeys, from whom these invasive recordings can be made. In this project, we will develop a model iBCI system that generates real-time biomimetic neural data by capturing the high-degree-of-freedom finger movements of able-bodied human subjects. To accomplish this, we will construct a modular recurrent neural network (RNN). The RNN will be trained to predict the motor cortex activity of a monkey from the monkey's own finger kinematics. Small modules of the RNN will be interchanged according the particular animal or recording session to model the high inter-session variability present in motor cortex. Once the modular RNN is trained, its weights will be fixed and human finger kinematics will be used as the RNN inputs, which will generate subject-controlled emulated neural activity. The emulated neural activity can be passed to iBCI decoding algorithms that control computer cursors or other physical devices, allowing human subjects to interact directly with decoders in real time, closed-loop conditions. We call this model system the jaBCI. The jaBCI is low cost and noninvasive, making it possible to rapidly test and design novel iBCI decoders using statistically rigorous sample sizes. The project will be executed in close collaboration with intracortical microelectrode array data expert Dr. Lee Miller at Northwestern University. Dr. Miller's lab, with the help of our consultant Dr. Mathis, will obtain simultaneous finger kinematics and neural activity of monkey subjects that will serve as the training data for the RNN component of the iBCI model. We will validate the emulated neural data generated by the jaBCI across many measures to ensure the model captures as many features of intracortical data as possible. These include comparing the model and actual iBCI in subject performance, learning rates, control strategies, neural variation across days, neural firing rate distributions, and low-dimensional neural dynamics. With the validated model, we will undertake a study to rigorously evaluate the highest performing, current state-of-the-art iBCI decoders. This will yield useful insight into the features of decoders that yield the greatest performance gains, overcoming the current impossibility to compare iBCI decoders in well-controlled studies using more than two or three naïve human subjects. We will also use the iBCI model to evaluate novel decoder designs, and to determine the features of neural dynamics that are consistent across common iBCI tasks to help focus decoder development on those features. Narrative Brain-computer interfaces are systems that translate the electrical neural signatures of thought into instructions for a personal computer or powered wheelchair, which is an incredibly useful technology to help paralyzed people regain some independence and ability to communicate. This work would develop a tool that scientists can use to design, test, and optimize the sophisticated computer programs that translate brain signals into device instructions without having to implant electrodes into a person's brain until the program is completed and rigorously tested. This tool could increase the pace of discovery and development of brain-computer interfaces.",An Intracortical Brain-Computer Interface Model for High Efficiency Development of Closed-Loop Neural Decoding Algorithms,9817780,R01NS109257,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biological Models', 'Biomimetics', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Finger joint structure', 'Fingers', 'Freedom', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Industry Standard', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Cortex', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operating System', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Personal Power', 'Persons', 'Posture', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Robotics', 'Rotation', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'brain computer interface', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer program', 'cost', 'design', 'finger movement', 'head-to-head comparison', 'high dimensionality', 'human subject', 'human-in-the-loop', 'innovation', 'insight', 'invention', 'kinematics', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'skill acquisition', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,367007,0.021737997613676677
"In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech Project Summary Tongue cancer and the treatments used to cure the disease such as glossectomy can have debilitating effects on speech and swallowing, yet not much is known about the relationship between tongue movements in speech and reconstruction choices after cancer resection. The tongue’s vital role in speaking and swallowing is executed by a uniquely complex array of muscles which deform locally into functional units. Tongue movements are governed by synergistic activation of these functional units using orthogonally oriented muscle fibers not a rigid skeletal structure. Functional units, which are regions of 3D coherent motion, are the structures that link low-level muscle activity to high-level surface tongue geometry. This link, the organization of functional units, can provide considerable insight into normal motor control and adapted tongue motion, as in patients who have had surgery for tongue cancer. However, there is poor understanding of the details of how muscle morphology contributes to function due to tongue muscle interdigitation and complex local activation. A key to understanding the relationship between the structure and function of the tongue is to identify functional units of motion in localized tongue regions and map them to muscle anatomy. A large step in this direction can be gained by developing a tool to cluster 3D coherent motion patterns from tagged MRI, and register them to muscle anatomy from high-resolution MRI. Speech motor control is a critical area of importance where platform tools for machine learning techniques are lacking. The goal of this project is to create a framework to relate the functional units to tongue muscle anatomy. This framework will enhance tongue motion analysis in medical research and clinical applications, where MRI is frequently used. To address this goal, we have already developed technologies to analyze high-resolution and tagged-MRI. The first is a detailed 3D muscle atlas based on 3D high-resolution MRI, which depicts the locations of both extrinsic and intrinsic muscles, and will be registered to each speaker to identify and track their muscles in the 3D tagged data sets. The second is software to derive 3D displacement and strain fields from tagged MR images. These displacements, strains, and derived quantities will be used to extract spatio-temporal feature vectors that define coherent regions, which will be verified with simulation. The vectors will then be input into a novel computational method using a NMF and clustering, the goal of which is to establish the functional units of speech. In addition, biomechanical simulations will be used to co-validate our findings. The concept of functional units is at the core of the proposed work, as it can provide insights into tongue muscle coordination in patients after glossectomy surgery. The research plan comprises two specific aims: (1) develop a computational method to establish functional units from MRI and (2) determine the relationship between alterations in anatomy and alterations in functional unit motion after tongue cancer treatment. Linking the functional units to the anatomy will allow the design of more focused treatments and therapies for tongue motion-related disorders. Project Narrative Functions of the tongue—speaking, eating, and breathing—are executed by using a complex muscular array to create global motions (synergies) by deforming local functional units which are intermediate structures that link muscle activity to surface tongue geometry. This project will develop new computational tools that will enable researchers and clinicians to determine the functional units of specific motions and relate them to the muscle anatomy. Such a breakthrough will dramatically improve our knowledge of the mechanisms of muscle coordination, thereby permitting improvement of diagnosis and treatment of tongue motion-related disorders.",In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech,9636557,R21DC016047,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Bone structure', 'Breathing', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Elements', 'Excision', 'Geometry', 'Gestures', 'Glossectomy', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Therapy', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Unit of Measure', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical application', 'computational basis', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'digital', 'functional independence', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'malignant tongue neoplasm', 'motor control', 'multidimensional data', 'muscular structure', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'reconstruction', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2019,210725,-0.014210345836843646
"Using Wearable and Mobile Data to Diagnose and Monitor Movement Disorders The long-term goal of the proposed work is to develop a tool to help diagnose and monitor movement disorders. Due to increasing and aging world population, more people are living with these disorders. As there is already a shortage of neurologists, and more specifically, movement disorder specialists that have the training to adequately diagnose and manage these disorders, there is a large number of patients that are not receiving optimal treatment. We propose to use a smartphone-based platform to assess the severity of symptoms that are common across different movement disorders in order to achieve our long-term goal. To that end, the current study proposes to tackle 4 specific aims. The first aim will be to develop a mobile application to quantify common symptoms of movement disorders. We will develop a new mobile application that will enable the quantification of symptom severity; namely rest tremor, postural tremor, intention tremor, kinetic tremor, upper-limb coordination, bradykinesia, balance, gait, and cognitive impairments. The data collected from the smartphone-embedded sensors will be transmitted to a secure server where data can be visualized and analyzed. The second aim will be to collect data using the mobile application from healthy individuals as well as individuals with different movement disorders. We will collect data from 30 healthy controls, 30 individuals with Essential tremor (ET), 30 individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), 30 individuals with Huntington's disease (HD), 30 individuals with primary focal dystonia (PFD) of the upper-limb, 30 individuals with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA, and 30 individuals with functional movement disorder (FMD). This dataset will enable us to develop algorithms (Aim 3) that will be used to assess symptom severity and differentiate the movement disorders according to the smartphone data. The third aim will be to develop algorithms to estimate symptom severity and distinguish the different movement disorders from one another. Using the data from the smartphone-embedded sensors, we will utilize machine learning approaches to estimate symptom severity (i.e. tremor, bradykinesia, gait impairment, etc.). Then, based on the symptom severity estimation as well as from features extracted from the sensor data, we will classify the subjects in groups according to their clinical diagnosis. This will enable us to differentiate the selected movement disorders. Finally, the fourth aim will be to assess the usability of the smartphone platform for long-term monitoring of patients. Subjects of patients recruited for Aim 2 will be asked to use the smartphone application at home for 8 weeks in order to determine compliance with its use and its stability over time. This study will provide a novel tool to assess motor and non-motor symptoms that could be used in other areas of research. It will provide a large database of movement, cognitive, demographic, and medical history data of individuals with different movement disorders. Most importantly, it will help in the differentiation and monitoring of movement disorders to improve the clinical management of individuals with these disorders. The prevalence of movement disorders is on the rise due to the expanding and aging world population while there is a lack of trained specialists in, and especially outside, of developed urban centers to adequately diagnose and manage those individuals. We propose that the ubiquity of smartphones could be leveraged to help non- specialists in the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of movement disorders that often exhibit overlapping symptoms such as Essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, primary focal dystonia, spinocerebllar ataxia, and functional movement disorders. We will develop a smartphone application that will collect data during different tasks to help differentiate these disorders and monitor them over time.",Using Wearable and Mobile Data to Diagnose and Monitor Movement Disorders,9655625,R15NS109741,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Bradykinesia', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dystonia', 'Economics', 'Equilibrium', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exhibits', 'Eye Movements', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Gait', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Huntington Disease', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intention Tremor', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life Expectancy', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical History', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Dystonias', 'Process', 'Psychological Factors', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Rest Tremor', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Spinocerebellar Ataxias', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'common symptom', 'equilibration disorder', 'functional disability', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'motor symptom', 'non-motor symptom', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'progressive neurodegeneration', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'usability', 'wearable device']",NINDS,RBHS-SCHOOL/ HEALTH RELATED PROFESSIONS,R15,2019,399532,0.03745389290224274
"Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT [ Pediatric specialists are often required to identify infants who are likely to suffer poor neurodevelopmental outcome, including Cerebral Palsy (CP). CP is the most common developmental disability among children in the United States and results from several factors, including low weight for gestational age, premature birth, and stroke. Although MRI and cranial ultrasound (cUS) provide valuable structural information in the preterm period, they have moderate sensitivity to CP and require transportation of the infant. Over the past 20 years, numerous studies have validated the clinical potential of General Movement Assessment (GMA) for CP risk identification. During the early period, (23 weeks to 36 weeks gestational age), the presence of Cramped Synchronized General Movements (CSGMs), has demonstrated very high sensitivity and specificity for CP, conjointly ranging from 80%-98%. CSGMs are assessed while preterm infants are still in an acute care facility (NICU) and can inform the clinician independently, and in combination with cUS and MRI. Despite its potential, GMA is available in only a few clinical centers, as adoption and routine application depend on lengthy, cost-intensive observation and availability of specially trained raters. A Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) is proposed that will automate GMA for bedside evaluations in both preterm and postterm periods. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology not only for routine risk identification, but also for establishing disease trajectory and potentially differentiating CP subtypes and assessing efficacy of emerging treatments along the early developmental continuum.  Preliminary studies at UC Irvine have demonstrated that GMA analysis for CSGMs can be automated by quantifying infant limb movement using highly miniaturized, 3-axis wireless accelerometers and classifying CSGMs using a patented Markov-type approach that merges an application-specific Erlang-Cox state transition model with a Dynamic Bayesian Network (“EC-DBN”), treating instantaneous machine learning classification values as observations and explicitly modeling CSGM (and non-CSGM) duration and interval. In Phase I, this approach will be utilized in a comparative evaluation of two movement measurement modalities to determine which has the best overall performance and clinical utility at three leading NICU centers. Infant movement data will be concurrently acquired using an advanced, second generation prototype wireless accelerometer system (CPRIS-A) and a high definition 3D (infrared) optical camera (CPRIS-O). The optical modality offers significant potential advantages as it requires no infant contact and can monitor unattended, intermittently, over weeks or months. However, its potential for GMA automation must be systematically evaluated. Classifier results from both modalities will be compared to expert rater consensus in 80 preterm infants. The primary outcome will be CSGM identification accuracy, as determined by ROC-AUC analyses, with a threshold for success of 0.85. Additional comparative performance measures include reliability and practicability in the NICU environment. An Advisory Committee of experts in the fields of neonatology, pediatrics and cerebral palsy will evaluate project results and advise on the clinical potential of each modality. ] PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability in childhood, with a prevalence of 2.1 cases per 1000 in high-income countries. The overall project goal is to develop a computerized hardware-software system capable of identifying preterm infants at high risk of developing cerebral palsy (CP), based on the systematic identification of specific patterns of movement-derived features.

"Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning Project Summary Behavior and cognition emerge from the coordinated activity of populations of interacting neurons. To change behavior we must change the architecture of the network that drives behavior. What are the rules whereby the activity of populations of neurons can change during learning? If we could observe the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning, we might be able to facilitate learning. This ability may eventually lead to improvements to neurally- based rehabilitation strategies that can facilitate the recovery from stroke.  We will use a neurofeedback paradigm to shape the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning. To do this, we will record the activity of dozens of neurons in the motor cortex of Rhesus monkey subjects. Animals will control a cursor on a computer screen by generating neural command signals. This is neurofeedback because the animal directly observes a projection of his neural activity, in the form of the movement of the onscreen cursor. This paradigm allows us to study learning simply by perturbing the mapping from neural activity to cursor movement on the screen. Following such a perturbation the animal must discover how to generate new patterns of neural activity that are now appropriate to restore good control of the onscreen cursor.  We will ask two linked questions. First, how does the animal learn to generate new patterns of neural activity? And second, can we facilitate that process? Neurofeedback-based learning offers complementary advantages to arm movements for studying the neural population dynamics that accompany learning. Chieﬂy, only in a neurofeedback paradigm can we be certain that the learning-induced changes in neural activity we observe matter directly for behavior, because only the neurons we record directly impact behavior in this paradigm.  We will test classic theories of skill learning, converted into speciﬁc hypotheses about how neural activity patterns will change throughout the multi-day course of skill learning.  If our neurofeedback-based incremental training schemes do facilitate learning, then this research will inform the work of rehabilitation specialists who work with stroke patients. We (and others) believe that if neurofeedback-based therapies are coupled with standard behavioral therapies for stroke, rehabilitation outcomes will improve. Project Narrative Stroke can be a debilitating condition. Only ﬁfty percent of stroke survivors make a full recovery, and that is usually only after extensive rehabilitation. The recovery from stroke and skill learning are probably closely related. We propose to develop brain-computer interface neurofeedback paradigms to facilitate the learning of new skills. If this is effective in our animal subjects it will provide new avenues to explore for stroke rehabilitation.",Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning,9671256,R01HD071686,"['Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Computers', 'Control Animal', 'Couples Therapy', 'Data', 'Electrodes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'arm movement', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain computer interface', 'design', 'forging', 'functional restoration', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'motor learning', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'network architecture', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurofeedback', 'neuromechanism', 'post stroke', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'restoration', 'skills', 'stroke model', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'theories', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,438050,-0.06417773694528651
"Neural dynamics and adaption for brain machine interface control Project Summary/Abstract  Millions of people suffer from some form of paralysis. In most of these cases the connection between the brain and the spinal cord is damaged, however, the motor cortex is healthy and intact. Thus, for these individuals, brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) hold significant promise for improving quality of life. BMIs decode an individual's intention to move by utilizing statistical models of neural activity patterns recorded from the motor cortex using implanted electrode arrays. While these methods have been encouraging in preclinical experiments and clinical trials for controlling thought-driven 2D computer cursors, they suffer from poor performance when applied to higher degrees-of-freedom (e.g., robotic limbs), and are not robust to the inevitable degradation of the electrode array. In order to address these clinical needs, this project starts from the recent observation that just as some behaviors are easier to learn, some patterns of neural activity, termed neural states, are also easier to generate. The overarching goal of this project is to elucidate if these “easy to generate” neural states can be used to robustly control a prosthetic arm. This is a significant departure from current decoding methods, which incorporate little to no information about the motor system, especially its ability to learn and adapt. The first major aim of this work is to develop experiments and analysis methods in order to find these “easy to generate” neural states in the non- human primate (i.e., rhesus monkey) motor system. Here “easy to generate” can be understood as the monkey's ability to volitionally generate that particular neural state. The second major aim of this work is to characterize the properties of the motor system that enable some states to be more easily generated than others. Prior work in our lab has shown that motor cortical population activity has well-defined structure, as predicted by dynamical system theory. These dynamics cause neural states to evolve in lawful ways through time. The work here will extend these findings by characterizing the dynamics associated with a monkey learning to generate a neural state. Finally, the third major aim of this work is to determine if neural states that monkeys can volitionally generate can be utilized for robust control of a prosthetic arm. The central hypothesis of this work is that building a model that only utilizes firing patterns that can be easily generated (as determined experimentally) will enable robust and high-performance control of a prosthetic arm. If successful, this study could have significant clinical impact by presenting a new paradigm to enable robust control of a prosthesis. Project Narrative  Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injuries or neurodegenerative diseases that result in considerable movement impairment. Brain machine interfaces (BMIs) hold considerable promise in drastically improving the quality of life for these individuals, who otherwise have very limited treatment options. This work will investigate the motor system's ability to learn and adapt, and directly use these insights to build robust high degree-of-freedom BMIs for clinical applications.",Neural dynamics and adaption for brain machine interface control,9765066,F31NS103409,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Arm', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Electrodes', 'Freedom', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Paralysed', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation device', 'Robotics', 'Spinal Cord', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Volition', 'Work', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'brain machine interface', 'clinical application', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'motor impairment', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'pre-clinical', 'prosthesis control', 'rehearsal', 'relating to nervous system']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,34556,0.05553079894211313
"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity. We will model how the cerebellum simple spike cognitive error signal might propagate through the network and be used to facilitate visuomotor association learning and the processing of signals in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex Project Narrative Learning that a particular object cues a particular action, as a red light makes us stop walking or brake the car, is critical for human behavior and can be degraded by human disease. This project will apply physiological, computational, and anatomical methods to investigate a brain network for visual learning. We will find the exact areas of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum that participate in this learning, and use machine learning techniques to understand how the activity of neurons recorded simultaneously in these brain areas can facilitate learning.",The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning,9818745,R01NS113078,"['Affect', 'Agonist', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar cortex structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fractals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Injections', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Reaction Time', 'Reading', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Work', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'human disease', 'kinematics', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'success', 'visual learning', 'visual motor']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,1164920,0.016279780902787692
"Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of sensation from the limbs. The past 15 years have seen remarkable advances in “Brain Machine Interfaces” (BMIs) that allow paralyzed persons to move anthropomorphic limbs using signals recorded directly from their brains. However, these movements remain slow, clumsy, and effortful, looking remarkably like those of individuals who have lost sensation from their arms due to peripheral neuropathy. Brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are unlikely to achieve high levels of performance in the absence of artificial sensory feedback. Early attempts at restoring somatosensation used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate somatosensory cortex (s1), requiring animals to learn largely arbitrary patterns of stimulation to represent two or three virtual objects or to navigate in two-dimensional space. While an important beginning, this approach seems unlikely to scale to the broad range of limb movements and interactions with objects that we experience in daily life.  To move the field past this hurdle, we propose to replace both touch and proprioception by using multi- electrode ICMS to produce naturalistic patterns of neuronal activity in S1 of monkeys. In Aim 1, we will develop model-optimized mappings between limb state (pressure on the fingertip, or motion of the limb) and the patterns of ICMS required to evoke S1 activation that mimics that of natural inputs. These maps will account for both the dynamics of neural responses and the biophysics of ICMS. We anticipate that this biomimetic approach will evoke intuitive sensations that require little or no training to interpret. We will validate the maps by comparing natural and ICMS-evoked S1 activity using novel hardware that allows for concurrent ICMS and neural recording. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of monkeys to recognize objects using artificial touch. Having learned to identify real objects by touch, animals will explore virtual objects with an avatar that shadows their own hand movements, receiving artificial touch sensations when the avatar contacts objects. We will test their initial performance on the virtual stereognosis task without learning, as well as their improvements in performance over time. Aim 3 will be similar, but will focus on proprioception. We will train monkeys to report the direction of brief force bumps applied to their hand. After training, we will replace the actual bumps with virtual bumps created by patterned ICMS, again asking the monkeys to report their perceived sense of the direction and magnitude of the perturbation. Finally, in Aim 4, we will temporarily paralyze the monkey's arm, thereby removing both touch and proprioception, mimicking the essential characteristics of a paralyzed patient. The avatar will be controlled based on recordings from motor cortex and guided by artificial somatosensation. The monkey will reach to a set of virtual objects, find one with a particular shape, grasp it, and move it to a new location. If we can demonstrate that this model-optimized, biomimetic feedback is informative and easy to learn, it should form the basis for robust, scalable, somatosensory feedback for BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of feeling from the limbs (somatosensation); brain machine interfaces (BMIs), which record signals directly from the brain, can be used to control prosthetic devices, computers, or environmental controls. However, BMIs currently do not restore somatosensation, a critical component of normal limb movement. We propose to develop a new type of brain interface that will mimic the somatosensory brain activity generated during movement and provide natural and informative artificial sensation for people with paralysis or limb amputation.",Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation,9707897,R01NS095251,"['Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cutaneous', 'Electrodes', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Block', 'Neurons', 'Numbness', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stereognosis', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'infancy', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'microstimulation', 'mind control', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prosthesis control', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory feedback', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual feedback']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,641907,0.05871557050564733
"Multiple timescales of motor planning and execution in mouse cortex Project Summary/Abstract: For animals to execute complicated behaviors, successful motor planning and execution is essential. Moreover, the sequence of events leading to successful goal-based behavior takes place over a wide range of timescales. For example, when walking from home to work, one must first make an abstract, long-timescale decision to go to work, which much then be translated into a sequence of shorter-timescale right-left turning decisions, which are translated into the finely fluctuating electrical patterns that control the muscles. How motor planning and execution occur simultaneously over many timescales in populations of motor cortex neurons is not well understood. Much work in humans and nonhuman primates have shown that visual and auditory stimuli integrate over multiple timescales. This work has shown that early sensory regions, like primary visual cortex, respond to fast fluctuations in the environment. This information is integrated to longer-timescale information in secondary cortical regions, with the longest- timescale information in frontal and association areas. We therefore hypothesize that secondary motor cortex (M2) neurons control behavior over longer timescales than primary motor cortex (M1) neurons. To study this phenomenon, I have built a setup in which head-fixed mice navigate in virtual reality to a rewarded location. In this setup, I can record video from all sides of the animal for high spatiotemporal resolution measurement of motor behaviors. I have developed machine learning algorithms to extract 3D pose data from these videos. In Aim 1, I will use calcium imaging to record large numbers of neurons in mouse M1 and M2 to correlate the activity of individual neurons and populations to the animal’s ongoing pose kinematics. We will supplement with targeted silicon probe recordings to capture fast neural responses. In Aim 2, I will compare the calcium dynamics in populations of M1 and M2 neurons in mice trained to perform a virtual motor planning task versus mice that have not been trained. We hypothesize that training to plan motor actions increases the timescale of M1/M2 neural activity. In Aim 3, we will use optogenetic silencing in specific regions of cortex to perturb the animal’s motor behavior. We hypothesize that the duration of the perturbed movements will be longer when M2 is perturbed than M1. In this way, we will study how different cortical regions relate to behavior over many timescales. This proposal will broaden our knowledge of cortical processing in general, and motor planning and execution in particular. Patients with mental illness, such as ADHD, autism, and Asperger’s disorder show impaired ability to plan upcoming movements. The first step to successfully treating these illnesses is to better understand how motor planning occurs in general. Project Narrative: This proposal will elucidate how motor planning and execution take place simultaneously, over many timescales, and across brain regions. Better understanding motor planning will help generate new treatments for diseases that affect motor planning, like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism.",Multiple timescales of motor planning and execution in mouse cortex,9752759,F31NS108450,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Asperger Syndrome', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laser Scanning Microscopy', 'Lasers', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Side', 'Silicon', 'Stereotyping', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'area striata', 'auditory stimulus', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'frontal lobe', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuromechanism', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory stimulus', 'spatiotemporal', 'theories', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2019,38053,0.034096082156101264
"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning Contact PD/PI: Raymond, Jennifer L. Project Summary Synapses between neurons are plastic – able to become stronger or weaker.

The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses.

"Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice PROJECT SUMMARY We often consider our movements a result of sensory processing – sensation guides behavior. However, animals selectively shape future sensory input through their own actions in a process known as active sampling. Thus, action and sensation are inextricably linked. Despite this, much of the research done on sensory processing restricts movement, most commonly via head fixation. To access sensorimotor processing during more natural behavior, we will study olfactory navigation in freely-moving mice. The olfactory system is ideal for studying sensory sampling, because of its ethological relevance for mammalian foraging and the dynamic nature of airborne odor stimuli. The proposed research will determine the sampling strategies of olfactory search and reveal the underlying circuitry that connects sensation with motion. Aim 1. It is unknown how rodents navigate dynamic plumes of odorant towards an odor source. In this aim, we will identify, analyze, and model active sensing behaviors that occur during increasingly difficult navigation tasks and with single nostrils occluded. These experiments will test the hypothesis that olfactory navigation works as a sensorimotor closed-loop system, where animals optimize sampling behaviors for the current stimulus conditions. These behavioral studies will lay the foundation for investigations of sensorimotor processing in dynamic olfactory scenes. Aim 2. To determine how sampling movements shape sensation, we will monitor neural activity during active sensory behavior. During odor tracking, we will electrophysiologically record in the olfactory bulb, a bottleneck through which all sensory input passes. We will determine the sensory history dependence of active sampling and, in doing so, reveal part of the underlying circuitry that connects motion with sensation. These experiments will test the hypothesis that sampling movements are sensory history dependent. To our knowledge, sampling movements and sensory activity have never been simultaneously recorded during olfactory navigation. This research will advance our understanding of the interplay between sensation and motion during natural behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deficits in sensory motor communication are a major contributor to prevalent neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.

"GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT  Human locomotion through natural environments requires the coordination of all levels of the sensorimotor hierarchy, from the cortical areas involved in processing of visual information and high level planning to the subcortical and spinal structures involved in the regulation of the gait and posture. However, despite the complex neural bases of human locomotion, the output is highly regular and well organized around the basic physical dynamics and biomechanics that define the stability and energetic costs of moving a bipedal body through space. There is a rich and growing body of literature describing detailed knowledge each of the individual components of human locomotion, including neural mechanisms, muscular neuromechanics, and biomechanics. However, very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion through a complex and dynamic world. This lack of integrative research not only restricts the breadth of impact of research from these individual disciplines, but also limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, it is necessary to develop an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world. In service of this general goal, this proposal outlines research projects aimed at specific unanswered questions about locomotion over different terrains. This proposal comprises three specific research and training aims on the visual control of locomotion over rough terrain. Aim 1 focuses on the behavioral task itself, Aim 2 investigates the sensory stimulus experienced during real-world locomotion, and Aim 3 examines the motor integration of visually specified goals into the ongoing gait cycle. Aim 1 investigates effects of changing environmental uncertainty and task demands on gaze allocation strategies during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 2 analyzes and models the visual stimulus experienced during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 3 determines how visually specified target footholds and targets are integrated into the ongoing preferred steady-state gait. Together these aims will significantly advance our understanding of how humans use vision to control their movement through the natural world, which greatly increase our ability to develop clinical diagnosis and treatment for loss of locomotor function.

"Intuitive, complete neural control of tablet computers for communication Project Summary Conventional augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices for people with severe speech and motor impairments (SSMI) rely on residual motor function, inherently limiting communication throughput. Commercially available AAC solutions require daily caregiver setup, need frequent recalibration often from a technically savvy caregiver, are often unable to be used in dark lighting conditions, and can encumber or fatigue important remaining physical abilities. Furthermore, for people with progressive motor dysfunction due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), even the most well-designed AAC devices will eventually fail as movements become unreliable. For people with brainstem stroke, ALS, and other disorders causing locked-in syndrome (LIS) or SSMI, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) hold promise as a method of enabling communication that does not rely upon speech or voluntary movement. In prior NIDCD-supported research, our BrainGate research team provided early proofs of principle of a powerful intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) that decodes movement intentions directly from brain activity. This technology has allowed people to control a cursor on a computer screen for communication simply by imagining movements of their own arm. The proposed NIDCD U01 clinical research will further the development and testing of a fully implanted iBCI that could provide robust, intuitive control of industry-grade communication apps for people with LIS or SSMI. By leveraging the ongoing pilot clinical trials of the investigational BrainGate system, we aim to (1) improve the robustness and accuracy of neurally actuated point-and click, in part through the translation of neuronal activity from human premotor and motor cortex, (2) expand the number of input dimensions to tablet computers available via neural activity, allowing intended hand gesture commands to control communication apps on touch-screen tablet computers, and (3) rigorously compare the performance of the investigational BrainGate system to trial participants’ conventional AAC systems with respect to communication competence, information throughput, user preference and outcomes measures. By incorporating the feedback of six individual participants with paralysis, this feasibility trial will optimize a powerful iBCI for communication and will establish the metrics needed for a subsequent pivotal trial of a fully implanted, always-available iBCI communication system for people with SSMI. Project Narrative People with brainstem stroke, advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease), or other disorders can become unable to move or speak despite being awake and alert. In this project, we seek to further translate knowledge about interpreting brain signals related to movement, and to further develop an intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) that could restore rapid and intuitive use of communication apps on tablet computers by people with paralysis.","Intuitive, complete neural control of tablet computers for communication",9729335,U01DC017844,"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Augmentative and Alternative Communication', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem Infarctions', 'Caregivers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Competence', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Family Caregiver', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Injury', 'Intention', 'Interactive Communication', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'Locked-In Syndrome', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Outcome Measure', 'Paralysed', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Residual state', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wireless Technology', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'communication device', 'deep learning', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'feasibility trial', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'long short term memory network', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'neural implant', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'phrases', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'two-dimensional']",NIDCD,BROWN UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,837287,0.014590062655212984

Mark Richardson, MD, PhD, Department ofNeurologicaJ Surgery and Robert S. Turner, PhD, Department ofNeurobiology, University ofPittsburgh; Wolf-Julian Neumann, MD, and Andrea A. Kiihn, MD, Department ofNeurology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin. Co-Investigators: Benjamin Blankertz, PhD, Department of Computer Science, Technische Universitat Berlin; Tom Mitchell, PhD, Machine Learning Department, Carnegie Mellon University. PROJECT DESCRIPTION 1 Introduction and Objectives  Deep brain stimulation (DBS) represents one of the major clinical breakthroughs in the age of translational neuroscience.1 In 1987, Benabid and colleagues demonstrated that high frequency stimulation can mimic the effects of ablative neurosurgery in Parkinson's disease (PD)2'3, while offering two key advantages to previous procedures: adjustability and reversibility. This project will employ artificial intelligence strategies, which have allowed for unprecedented innovations in translational, personalized, high-definition medicine4, to further elevate the therapeutic potential of DBS. By developing a computational framework for decoding behavioral and disease states from combined subthalamic and cortical population recordings, this work will inform future adaptive stimulation paradigms for PD and other movement disorders. The central aim is to develop a computational framework for deep learning- based multi-feature decoding of behavioral and disease states from electrocorticography (ECoG), in order to advance the evolution of aDBS. Proposed Research. The concurrent use ofresearch ECoG during DBS surgery recently has enabled basic neuroscience investigation ofhuman co11ical-subcortical network dynamics. The overall goal ofthis project is to establish intelligent algorithms to identify physiological and pathophysiological states in ECoG data that predict epochs during which stimulation would facilitate movement or reduce symptoms. Given that ECoG electrode strips can be implanted safely during DBS surge1y5·6, the use of ECoG for aDBS is hypothesized to have several advantages: 1. compatibility with any DBS electrode design; 2. optimal signal  to noise ratio, 3. customization of electrode implantation location, based on known network connectivity of the target nucleus; 4. potential implantation of multiple remote sensors in different brain regions. Several barriers, however, exi'st for advancing this type of strategy. Namely, neither instantaneous biomarkers, evidence for optimal recording locations, adaptive control algorithms, nor previous reports on the use of ECoG-based, adaptive DBS have been described in PD patients. These obstacles will be overcome through achieving the following: Objective #1: Identify cortical and subthalamic biomarkers that can distinguish activity related to physiological motor behaviorfrom that related to pathological symptoms. The goal of objective 1 is to distinguish oscillatory features in population activity based on the temporal, spectral and spatial specificity of their synchronization across the corticosubthalamic axis, e.g. characteristic evolution of beta activity with bradykinesia vs. rhythmic high frequency activity  synchronized during tremor. Features that reflect instantaneous motor behavior and parkinsonian symptom  severity will be characterized through spectral decomposition mapped to 3D reconstructions of recording locations.  Objective #2: Determi11e tlte optimal computational approaclt fol' real-time ,letection and prediction of physiological andpatliophysiological behaviors.  The goal of objective 2 is to use results from the first objective to build a computational framework for deep learning of physiological and pathophysiological states from cortical time-series data based on  hierarchical recurrent artificial neural networks.

"Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of tetraplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop methods to artificially activate and control paralyzed muscles with electrodes implanted in muscles. This effort will contribute to the restoration of voluntary limb movements in individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke.",Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation,9593999,R01NS102259,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Digit structure', 'Elbow', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Error Sources', 'Experimental Models', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Forearm', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Intramuscular', 'Joints', 'Lifting', 'Limb structure', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle Fatigue', 'Output', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Space', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Quadriplegia', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'artificial neural network', 'awake', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'design', 'experience', 'finger movement', 'grasp', 'hand grasp', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'neuroprosthesis', 'nonhuman primate', 'response', 'restoration', 'robotic device', 'scapula']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2018,293386,0.0818637926074354
"PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device Summary / Abstract  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-I project proposes the development of an image- processing-based tool, named PostureCheck™, aimed at automatically detecting when patients perform undesirable compensatory movements during robot-assisted upper-limb rehabilitation exercises. The system will be based on a standard video camera (e.g., GoPro) that will be used to capture the movements of the subject.  The automatic detection of undesirable compensatory movements is especially important when patients use a rehabilitation robotic system with minimum supervision, i.e. when a single therapist oversees the therapeutic sessions of multiple patients simultaneously. In this context, PostureCheck™ may be capable of tracking robot-assisted rehabilitation exercises and enable feedback modalities to discourage the performance of undesirable compensatory movements.  Our long-term goal is to integrate PostureCheck™ with the Barrett Upper-extremity Robotic Trainer - BURT®, which we developed with special emphasis on stroke rehabilitation. The combination of PostureCheck™ with the BURT® device would be ideally suited for deployment in “Robotic Gyms”, where a single therapist oversees the therapeutic sessions of several patients simultaneously, thus allowing rehabilitation centers to offer high-dosage, high-intensity interventions despite the limited number of therapists currently available in the US.  To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept, we will develop PostureCheck™ to detect the most common compensatory movements automatically. To achieve this goal, we will rely on recently developed artificial intelligence (AI) methods referred to as Deep Learning. These methods have recently broken records in the human-posture analysis, joint-skeleton detection, and recognition of human activities using a single inexpensive camera. The proposed video-based PostureCheck™ tool will be the first system to exploit the capabilities of hybrid Deep Neural Networks, for real-time detection of compensatory movements during robot- assisted rehabilitation.  The proposed SBIR Phase-I activities are organized in three aims. In Aim 1, feedback from rehabilitation experts at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital will be used to collect video data and to label compensatory movements observed during the performance of robot-assisted rehabilitation exercises by using the BURT® system. In Aim 2, Deep Learning techniques will be used to develop a robust detection of undesirable compensatory movements during the performance of robot-assisted rehabilitation exercises. Finally, in Aim 3, the algorithms developed in Aim 2 will be optimized. Specifically, we will test implementations that are suitable to generate real-time feedback. Computationally efficient implementations of the algorithms will enable - in future studies - the development of new modalities of control of the rehabilitation robot with the objective of discouraging undesirable compensatory movements. Project Narrative  Each year, nearly 800,000 Americans suffer from a type of stroke that particularly weakens one side of the body. During upper-limb rehabilitation, appropriate feedback from a therapist to discourage stroke survivors from performing undesirable compensatory movements results in better motor recovery and - eventually - improved function. This proposal aims to develop a novel video-based tool, named PostureCheck™, to detect undesirable compensatory movements and enable automatic corrective feedback to the patient during robot- assisted upper-limb therapy.",PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device,9678997,R43EB027525,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Names', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Records', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shoulder', 'Side', 'Skeleton', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Videotape', 'Vision', 'base', 'clinical efficacy', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'dosage', 'efficacy evaluation', 'exercise rehabilitation', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'interest', 'meetings', 'monocular', 'motor impairment', 'motor recovery', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'recruit', 'restoration', 'robot assistance', 'robot rehabilitation', 'robotic device', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke therapy', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,"BARRETT TECHNOLOGY, LLC",R43,2018,223752,-0.011656786828393677
"Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots PROJECT SUMMARY This application will result in a technological platform that re-empowers persons with severe paralysis, by allowing them to independently control a wide spectrum of robotic actions. Severe paralysis is devastating, and chronic—and reliance on caregivers is persistent. Assistive machines such as wheelchairs and robotic arms offer a groundbreaking path to independence: where control over their environment and interactions is returned to the person.  However, to operate complex machines like robotic arms and hands typically poses a difﬁcult learning challenge and requires complex control signals—and the commercial control interfaces accessible to persons with severe paralysis (e.g. sip-and-puff, switch-based head arrays) are not adequate. As a result, assistive robotic arms remain largely inaccessible to those with severe paralysis—arguably the population who would beneﬁt from them most.  The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. Control interfaces that generate a unique map from a user's body motions to control signals for a machine offer a customized interaction, however these interfaces have only been used to issue low-dimensional (2-D) control signals whereas more complex machines require higher-dimensional (e.g. 6-D) signals. We propose an approach that leverages robotics autonomy and machine learning in order to aid the end-user in learning how to issue effective higher-dimensional control signals through body motions. Speciﬁcally, initially the human issues a lower- dimensional control signal and robotics autonomy is used to bridge the gap by taking over whatever is not covered by the human's control signal. Help from the robotics autonomy is then progressively scaled back, automatically, to cover fewer and fewer control dimensions as the user becomes more skilled.  The ﬁrst piece to our approach deals with how to extract control signals from the human, using the body-machine interface. The development and optimization of decoding procedures for controlling a robotic arm using residual body motions will be addressed under Speciﬁc Aim 1. The second piece to our approach deals with how to interpret control signals from a human within a paradigm that shares control between the human and robotics autonomy. To identify which shared-control formulations most effectively utilize the human's control signals will be the topic of Speciﬁc Aim 2. The ﬁnal piece to our approach deals with how to adapt the shared-control paradigm so that more control is transferred to the human over time. This adaptation is necessary for the human's learning process, since the goal in the end is for the human to be able to fully control the robotic arm him/herself, and will be assessed under Speciﬁc Aim 3.  At the completion of this project, tetraplegic end-users will be able to operate a robotic arm using their residual body motions, through an interface that both promotes the use of residual body motions (and thus also recovery of motor skill) and adapts with the human as their abilities change over time. By leveraging adaptive robotics autonomy, our application moreover provides a safe mechanism to facilitate learning how to operate the robotic platform. Frequently the more severe a person's motor impairment, the less able they are to operate the very assistive machines, like powered wheelchairs and robotic arms, which might enhance their quality of life. The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means, through non-invasive technologies, to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. We propose and study an approach that leverages robot machine learning and autonomy in order to facilitate human motor learning of how to operate a robotic arm using a customized interface, in order to make powered assisted manipulation more accessible to people with severe paralysis. 1",Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots,9448794,R01EB024058,"['3-Dimensional', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Residual state', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Shoulder', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal cord injured survivor', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'body-machine interface', 'brain machine interface', 'empowerment', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'n-dimensional', 'novel strategies', 'physical conditioning', 'psychologic', 'robot control', 'sensor', 'two-dimensional']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2018,331851,0.045231651584382034
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9455790,R01NS063399,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incentives', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,377627,0.02701671825480859
"Wireless Movement Sensing System for People with Severe Disabilities Abstract The ability of people with severe physical impairment to participate in family life, communication, work, or recreation is severely restricted without access to assistive technology (AT). Yet, as disability severity increases, so does the challenge to finding (1) an access movement that a person can perform to control AT and (2) an access technology that can detect the access movement. We propose to create a wireless movement sensing system that can learn a user’s access movement and then recognize that movement in order to wirelessly control assistive devices. Once we complete the technology development, we will measure the sensitivity and specificity of our wireless movement sensing system using the movements of ten people with SPI. We will present our results to AT experts during a focus group session and determine the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the technology. This Phase 1 research is proposed by a multidisciplinary research team consisting of AT engineers, AT clinicians, and a machine learning expert.

"Quantitative Handwriting Assessment Tool for Healthy and Impaired Children No technology currently exists for objective assessment of handwriting, even though over 3 million individuals in the United States suffer from disorders that affect handwriting, including 2.7 million children with dyspraxia and over 300,000 older adults with Parkinson's disease. This lack of assessment technology creates a barrier to effective care, because occupational therapists cannot easily distinguish motor disorders from non- motor causes of handwriting disability, a necessary step toward developing appropriate treatment plans. Our goal is to develop Write to Hand, the first quantitative digital assessment of the motor skills that underlie handwriting.  In partnership with Washington University in St. Louis, PlatformSTL is uniquely suited to address the handwriting assessment gap. Our team is led by a neuroscientist who developed the Precision Drawing Task, a laboratory research tool with an established history of successful assessment and training of writing-related motor skills. The Precision Drawing Task will serve as the basis for Write to Hand. Our Phase I objective is to develop a fully functional prototype of Write to Hand, and demonstrate scientific validity in children grades 4-5. Data analysis will include an initial application of a machine learning approach, which will test its feasibility in advance of its primary role in Phase II.  Aim 1 of this STTR is to develop the Write to Hand iPad app, which must meet seven specific criteria including: high-precision data collection with a fine-point stylus; rapid calculation of movement speed, smoothness, straightness, and error rate; and data anonymization that meets HIPAA and IRB standards. Aim 2 will demonstrate validity by comparing Write to Hand performance against a handwriting benchmark in 56 children grades 4-5. We expect that movement smoothness will significantly and meaningfully (r2 > 0.25) predict handwriting skill, and we will use a machine learning approach (Generalized Factorial Method) determine the most predictive classifier for handwriting skill, identify task features that optimize handwriting prediction, and demonstrate feasibility of our machine learning approach to characterize and classify Write to Hand data.  Our product will transform therapy for individuals with handwriting disabilities, by providing educators, therapists, and researchers with a gold standard for assessment and quantification of handwriting's underlying motor control skills. This will, for the first time, allow objective identification of motor impairment in local and tele-health settings. In Phase II we will collect data across participant ages to train our machine learning algorithm so Write to Hand can label performance with easy-to-interpret grade level ratings. Our commercialization plan focuses on occupational therapists and educators who serve children with motor disabilities. Therapists currently have no objective tools to measure handwriting in children or impaired adults. This project will develop an iPad app to measure the movement skills that support effective handwriting. With this tool, therapists will be able to identify when handwriting disability arises from a movement problem, and develop treatment plans accordingly.",Quantitative Handwriting Assessment Tool for Healthy and Impaired Children,9679822,R41HD097833,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Apraxias', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Benchmarking', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Face', 'Fingers', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Handwriting', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intuition', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Paper', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Societies', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Upper Extremity', 'Washington', 'Writing', 'analytical method', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'elementary school', 'falls', 'innovation', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'prototype', 'skills', 'teacher', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NICHD,"NEWVENTUREIQ, LLC",R41,2018,240711,0.034758220633404086
"An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers Motor development plays a pivotal role in an infant’s overall development and has a cascading effect on social, cognitive, memory, and language ability. These functions can be compromised when motor development is disrupted; motor disruption is associated with generalized developmental delays. Early screening and identification of delays can allow early interventions with the goal of not just improving motor function but overall development in other domains. Experience with independent or motorized crawling is shown to improve spatial memory in infants. Active motor training, even as early as 3 months, is shown to achieve gains in object exploration and social engagement that persist long after the training sessions, indicating the benefits of early intervention. Children who get developmental screening are more likely to be identified with delays and receive early intervention services compared to those that only receive age-appropriate milestone checks as part of pediatric well-child visits. However, comprehensive motor screening, using standardized instruments, for developmental surveillance is labor intensive and requires specialized training in administration and evaluation. Shortage of resources to perform frequent, gold-standard, comprehensive motor assessments can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and contribute negatively to lifelong outcomes for infants at risk for behavioral and developmental disorders. In the US, 15-20% of children have a developmental or behavioral disability, but less than a third of them get diagnosed before entering school, preventing opportunities for early intervention during a critical period of brain development. In Phase I, we built a prototype Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) to automate extraction of infant motor movement from video; then utilized this engine to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated developmental risk screener by leveraging recent advances in machine learning to achieve state of the art accuracies in assessment of infant motor development. In Phase II, we aim to build out the risk screener, SCOREIT, as a clinically deployable, cost-effective, developmental risk assessment tool to identify children who need further clinical follow-up. SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental screening by bringing the power of comprehensive motor screening, usually administered only to at-risk children utilizing specialized resources, to underserved and economically-fragile communities. Less than a third of US children receive developmental screening. SCOREIT can bring risk screenings to the over 70% of children that currently do not receive them, increasing opportunities for early intervention for behavioral and developmental disorders. Additionally, the HARE system’s ability to automatically extract and quantify motor movements from video can be an enabler for explorations of early markers for behavioral and developmental disorders, significantly easing manual video coding burdens and accelerating the pace of discoveries. This proposal introduces an automated, portable, low-cost developmental risk assessment tool, SCOREIT, that leverages advances in machine learning to extract motor movements from infant videos and generate a motor developmental score based on a standardized instrument (Alberta Infant Motor Scale; AIMS). SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental risk screening by bringing the power of standardized, comprehensive motor screening to underserved, economically-fragile communities, and increase opportunities for early intervention of developmental disorders.",An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers,9558014,R44HD095783,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alberta province', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Coordination Disorders', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Parents', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Supination', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'early screening', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning network', 'motor function improvement', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'social', 'social engagement', 'spatial memory', 'tool']",NICHD,"BSOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2018,605627,0.009147594537854261
"Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits Project Summary  Of the diverse features of the mammalian motor repertoire, skilled limb movements have become some of the more impressive and indispensable ways of interacting with the environment. The susceptibility of these movements to neurodegenerative disease and injury underscores the need for a better understanding of how neural circuits orchestrate these dexterous behaviors. This goal demands sophisticated experimental scrutiny at both neural and behavioral levels, and while the emergence of genetic tools for monitoring and manipulating neural circuits in mice has been transformative, the development of motor behavioral assays has not kept pace. Typically, a single behavioral test is applied to the question at hand, precluding a more comprehensive description of why relevant neural circuits have evolved their particular anatomical and functional attributes. Moreover, in the study of limb motor control, primate-inspired behavioral paradigms tend to be applied to the mouse by default, risking neglect of a more complete and naturalistic account of motor circuit function.  Ethology emphasizes an unbiased study of behavior under natural conditions. This proposal describes an ethological approach for the quantification and categorization of skilled limb movements in mice, enabling a depth and breadth of behavioral analysis that more closely aligns with the complexity of the underlying neural circuits. Several complementary approaches for unbiased behavioral quantification of mouse limb movements in enriched environments will be developed in parallel: a set of optical techniques enabling automated three- dimensional reconstruction of limb and digit posture and trajectory; and an approach that leverages advances in the miniaturization of motion sensors for camera-free limb tracking that can be integrated seamlessly with neural and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Through iterative refinement, this multifaceted strategy should highlight the strengths and mitigate potential drawbacks of each tracking method, providing a suite of complementary quantitative tools. Kinematic, kinetic, EMG and neural data collected across diverse behavioral contexts will be used to guide machine learning-based classification of natural structure in limb movements and in their underlying neural circuits. As a proving ground for how these naturalistic behavioral analyses can be integrated with the genetic dissection of neural circuit function, a set of molecularly defined motor circuits will be probed using novel optogenetic tools that permit selective inhibition at defined axon collateral terminals. This combination of projection specific genetic perturbation and ethologically driven behavioral analyses will provide a powerful lens through which to view the fine-grained functional organization of mammalian motor circuits. More generally, this merging of molecular and systems neuroscience approaches will offer a novel way to explore and compare fine motor control across species, equipping the field with a more comprehensive and standardized approach to study skilled behavior, and helping lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of behavioral deficits associated with neural circuit dysfunction. Project Narrative Skilled limb movements play a central role in mammalian behavior, from the seemingly mundane to the astoundingly athletic – yet little is known about how specific neural circuits orchestrate limb motor output to ensure precision and dexterity. To identify the neural basis of skilled behaviors, a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of natural limb movements in mice is needed to take better advantage of the powerful genetic accessibility of this model system. The ability to track and define these skilled, natural movements will enable a more sensitive and empirical exploration of the neural control of behavior, and should lay the groundwork for more effective diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits caused by disease or injury.",Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits,9632111,DP2NS105555,"['Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Injury', 'Kinetics', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'dexterity', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'kinematics', 'lens', 'limb movement', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP2,2018,99879,0.009243904705770137
"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning. Deep understanding of sensory-motor systems will aid in development of new treatment modalities for diseases that impair motor function, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. n/a","CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling",9524750,R01NS100049,"['Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Huntington Disease', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'control theory', 'cost', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional plasticity', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mathematical analysis', 'medical schools', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'sensorimotor system', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,205290,0.024624673155081368
"Retinal eye-tracking for the prognosis and monitoring of multiple sclerosis Abstract The goal of this project is to validate an innovative, highly sensitive retinal eye-tracking technology, the tracking scanning laser ophthalmoscope (TSLO), as a prognostic and monitoring tool for neurodegenerative disorders, namely multiple sclerosis (MS). The applications of effective treatments for multiple sclerosis are constrained by (1) the absence of methods for early detection and (2) quantitative, highly sensitive methods monitoring deficits early in disease course when treatment may have a better chance of success. As already demonstrated, the TSLO is capable of rapidly assessing and measuring the extraordinarily fine, microscopic motion of the human eye during fixation in MS patients. Fixational eye movements are neurally-encoded, involuntary movements that require the coordination of many areas of the central nervous system. Given the TSLO’s theoretical sensitivity to change (0.2 arcminutes) and its precision of measurement - fixational eye movements have the potential utility for tracking neurodegenerative disease progression at an unprecedented scale. With the advent of the new FDA-approved MS treatment targeting B-cells (ocrelizumab), clinical tools are now desperately needed to not only assess treatment efficacy, but to objectively assess patient disability at the earliest stage of disease in order to cut relapse rates and prevent irrevocable disability. In this project, we will determine the optimal fixational eye motion metrics to distinguish patients from controls, establish the relationship between clinical disease severity measures and fixational eye movement deficits as defined by the TSLO system, and to use machine learning algorithms to further strengthen our fixational metrics. Narrative The goal of our project is to clinically validate a retinal imaging and eye-tracking technology, the tracking scanning laser ophthalmoscope (TSLO), as a prognostic and monitoring tool for neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We now have demonstrated that the human lumbosacral spinal cord can be neuromodulated with epidural stimulation to enable recovery of standing and volitional control of the lower limbs and return of some autonomic function after complete motor paralysis.  Therefore, our objectives are now to develop the technologies needed to more fully capitalize on this clinical potential and develop home-use technologies to do so.",Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI,9572928,U01EB007615,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bladder Control', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrodes', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intramuscular', 'Learning', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Sensory', 'Sex Functioning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord Contusions', 'Spinal Cord transection injury', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Training', 'Volition', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'motor control', 'motor function improvement', 'motor function recovery', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'somatosensory', 'treadmill', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2018,1060180,0.09310700945794884
"In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech Project Summary Tongue cancer and the treatments used to cure the disease such as glossectomy can have debilitating effects on speech and swallowing, yet not much is known about the relationship between tongue movements in speech and reconstruction choices after cancer resection. The tongue’s vital role in speaking and swallowing is executed by a uniquely complex array of muscles which deform locally into functional units. Tongue movements are governed by synergistic activation of these functional units using orthogonally oriented muscle fibers not a rigid skeletal structure. Functional units, which are regions of 3D coherent motion, are the structures that link low-level muscle activity to high-level surface tongue geometry. This link, the organization of functional units, can provide considerable insight into normal motor control and adapted tongue motion, as in patients who have had surgery for tongue cancer. However, there is poor understanding of the details of how muscle morphology contributes to function due to tongue muscle interdigitation and complex local activation. A key to understanding the relationship between the structure and function of the tongue is to identify functional units of motion in localized tongue regions and map them to muscle anatomy. A large step in this direction can be gained by developing a tool to cluster 3D coherent motion patterns from tagged MRI, and register them to muscle anatomy from high-resolution MRI. Speech motor control is a critical area of importance where platform tools for machine learning techniques are lacking. The goal of this project is to create a framework to relate the functional units to tongue muscle anatomy. This framework will enhance tongue motion analysis in medical research and clinical applications, where MRI is frequently used. To address this goal, we have already developed technologies to analyze high-resolution and tagged-MRI. The first is a detailed 3D muscle atlas based on 3D high-resolution MRI, which depicts the locations of both extrinsic and intrinsic muscles, and will be registered to each speaker to identify and track their muscles in the 3D tagged data sets. The second is software to derive 3D displacement and strain fields from tagged MR images. These displacements, strains, and derived quantities will be used to extract spatio-temporal feature vectors that define coherent regions, which will be verified with simulation. The vectors will then be input into a novel computational method using a NMF and clustering, the goal of which is to establish the functional units of speech. In addition, biomechanical simulations will be used to co-validate our findings. The concept of functional units is at the core of the proposed work, as it can provide insights into tongue muscle coordination in patients after glossectomy surgery. The research plan comprises two specific aims: (1) develop a computational method to establish functional units from MRI and (2) determine the relationship between alterations in anatomy and alterations in functional unit motion after tongue cancer treatment. Linking the functional units to the anatomy will allow the design of more focused treatments and therapies for tongue motion-related disorders. Project Narrative Functions of the tongue—speaking, eating, and breathing—are executed by using a complex muscular array to create global motions (synergies) by deforming local functional units which are intermediate structures that link muscle activity to surface tongue geometry. This project will develop new computational tools that will enable researchers and clinicians to determine the functional units of specific motions and relate them to the muscle anatomy. Such a breakthrough will dramatically improve our knowledge of the mechanisms of muscle coordination, thereby permitting improvement of diagnosis and treatment of tongue motion-related disorders.",In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech,9452335,R21DC016047,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Bone structure', 'Breathing', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Elements', 'Excision', 'Geometry', 'Gestures', 'Glossectomy', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Therapy', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Unit of Measure', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'digital', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'malignant tongue neoplasm', 'motor control', 'muscular structure', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'reconstruction', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2018,249441,-0.014210345836843646
"Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT [ Pediatric specialists are often required to identify infants who are likely to suffer poor neurodevelopmental outcome, including Cerebral Palsy (CP). CP is the most common developmental disability among children in the United States and results from several factors, including low weight for gestational age, premature birth, and stroke. Although MRI and cranial ultrasound (cUS) provide valuable structural information in the preterm period, they have moderate sensitivity to CP and require transportation of the infant. Over the past 20 years, numerous studies have validated the clinical potential of General Movement Assessment (GMA) for CP risk identification. During the early period, (23 weeks to 36 weeks gestational age), the presence of Cramped Synchronized General Movements (CSGMs), has demonstrated very high sensitivity and specificity for CP, conjointly ranging from 80%-98%. CSGMs are assessed while preterm infants are still in an acute care facility (NICU) and can inform the clinician independently, and in combination with cUS and MRI. Despite its potential, GMA is available in only a few clinical centers, as adoption and routine application depend on lengthy, cost-intensive observation and availability of specially trained raters. A Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) is proposed that will automate GMA for bedside evaluations in both preterm and postterm periods. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology not only for routine risk identification, but also for establishing disease trajectory and potentially differentiating CP subtypes and assessing efficacy of emerging treatments along the early developmental continuum.  Preliminary studies at UC Irvine have demonstrated that GMA analysis for CSGMs can be automated by quantifying infant limb movement using highly miniaturized, 3-axis wireless accelerometers and classifying CSGMs using a patented Markov-type approach that merges an application-specific Erlang-Cox state transition model with a Dynamic Bayesian Network (“EC-DBN”), treating instantaneous machine learning classification values as observations and explicitly modeling CSGM (and non-CSGM) duration and interval. In Phase I, this approach will be utilized in a comparative evaluation of two movement measurement modalities to determine which has the best overall performance and clinical utility at three leading NICU centers. Infant movement data will be concurrently acquired using an advanced, second generation prototype wireless accelerometer system (CPRIS-A) and a high definition 3D (infrared) optical camera (CPRIS-O). The optical modality offers significant potential advantages as it requires no infant contact and can monitor unattended, intermittently, over weeks or months. However, its potential for GMA automation must be systematically evaluated. Classifier results from both modalities will be compared to expert rater consensus in 80 preterm infants. The primary outcome will be CSGM identification accuracy, as determined by ROC-AUC analyses, with a threshold for success of 0.85. Additional comparative performance measures include reliability and practicability in the NICU environment. An Advisory Committee of experts in the fields of neonatology, pediatrics and cerebral palsy will evaluate project results and advise on the clinical potential of each modality. ] PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability in childhood, with a prevalence of 2.1 cases per 1000 in high-income countries. The overall project goal is to develop a computerized hardware-software system capable of identifying preterm infants at high risk of developing cerebral palsy (CP), based on the systematic identification of specific patterns of movement-derived features. The Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) will enable clinical staff with only minimal training to cost effectively implement General Movement Assessment (GMA) for Cramped Synchronous General Movements (CSGMs), with interpretive reporting performed automatically.

"A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis Project Summary  The goal of the proposed work is to develop a robust hybrid neural-machine interface (NMI), combining brain and muscle signals, to improve overall control of a lower limb prosthetic device during activities of daily living. Limb amputation affects over 600,000 individuals annually in the US, and is a major cause of physical disability that causes activities of daily living to become difficult or impossible for the amputee. The limitations of current lower-limb prostheses are associated with limited volitional control, reduced mobility, and chronic gait abnormalities, which have been linked to exhaustion from increased energy expenditure, increased risk of falling, and degenerative bone and joint disorders in both the intact and amputated limb. In this study, EMG signals from both residual and intact lower limbs and EEG signals from the cortex are leveraged to decode transitions to and from various modes of locomotion modes in able-bodied individuals and transfemoral amputees, and to provide a global understanding of movement at the cortical, muscular, and kinematic level in amputees. Specifically, time and frequency domain features are leveraged to create a prediction algorithm capable of identifying upcoming terrain transitions in advance. In lower limb amputees, this hybrid NMI paradigm translates to volitional control of a powered lower-limb prosthesis, which allows for seamless transitions between various movement conditions. The high-level of control is expected to result in significant increases in level of activity and overall improvements in gait. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of EEG or EMG based NMIs for orthotic and prosthetic devices; however, no study to date has integrated EEG and EMG in a NMI for powered lower limb prostheses. This study is motivated by the need to explore advanced neural control sources for intuitive control of artificial limbs.  This project aligns directly with the Mission & Goals of the NIH, the Brain Initiative, and NIH’s Blueprint Program by expanding fundamental knowledge of neuroscience, human, health and wellness; by utilizing an innovative research strategy; and ultimately returning the knowledge to the public through the development of a highly advanced medical technology. Furthermore, the technology developed through this work has implications beyond the amputee population in the treatment of many neurological conditions and injuries, such as in neurorehabilitation after stroke. The innovation of this project lies in the novel approach of using multimodal neural signals and movement synergies as a framework for interpreting movement of the lower limb. The scientific impact is realized by a greater understanding of the neural correlates of movement after lower-limb amputation. The direct clinical significance for the patient can be measured directly through improved gait performance and walking confidence, leading to increased mobility and a reduced risk of falling, exhaustion, and bone and joint disorders. Project Narrative  The development of a hybrid neural-machine interface that incorporates muscle and brain signaling for communication with robotic systems is important to public health because it allows for robust volitional control of powered prostheses and exoskeletons during activities of daily living. This will directly benefit the amputee population by allowing better control of their prosthesis during locomotion, especially when navigating complex terrains, such as stairs and inclines. The implications of this technology can be used beyond the amputee population to further understand the effect of neurological injuries on the brain, and for improving rehabilitation paradigms associated with their treatment.",A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis,9604145,F99NS105210,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Amputees', 'Ankle', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Body Image', 'Bone Diseases', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Electronic Mail', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Agency', 'Future Teacher', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Neurosciences', 'Oral', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prosthesis', 'Public Health', 'Ramp', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Robotics', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Volition', 'Walking', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'exhaustion', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel strategies', 'posters', 'powered prosthesis', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'rehabilitation paradigm', 'relating to nervous system', 'robot control', 'robot exoskeleton', 'robot rehabilitation', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'undergraduate student', 'visual motor']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,F99,2018,36509,0.056092115484414194
"Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning Project Summary Behavior and cognition emerge from the coordinated activity of populations of interacting neurons. To change behavior we must change the architecture of the network that drives behavior. What are the rules whereby the activity of populations of neurons can change during learning? If we could observe the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning, we might be able to facilitate learning. This ability may eventually lead to improvements to neurally- based rehabilitation strategies that can facilitate the recovery from stroke.  We will use a neurofeedback paradigm to shape the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning. To do this, we will record the activity of dozens of neurons in the motor cortex of Rhesus monkey subjects. Animals will control a cursor on a computer screen by generating neural command signals. This is neurofeedback because the animal directly observes a projection of his neural activity, in the form of the movement of the onscreen cursor. This paradigm allows us to study learning simply by perturbing the mapping from neural activity to cursor movement on the screen. Following such a perturbation the animal must discover how to generate new patterns of neural activity that are now appropriate to restore good control of the onscreen cursor.  We will ask two linked questions. First, how does the animal learn to generate new patterns of neural activity? And second, can we facilitate that process? Neurofeedback-based learning offers complementary advantages to arm movements for studying the neural population dynamics that accompany learning. Chieﬂy, only in a neurofeedback paradigm can we be certain that the learning-induced changes in neural activity we observe matter directly for behavior, because only the neurons we record directly impact behavior in this paradigm.  We will test classic theories of skill learning, converted into speciﬁc hypotheses about how neural activity patterns will change throughout the multi-day course of skill learning.  If our neurofeedback-based incremental training schemes do facilitate learning, then this research will inform the work of rehabilitation specialists who work with stroke patients. We (and others) believe that if neurofeedback-based therapies are coupled with standard behavioral therapies for stroke, rehabilitation outcomes will improve. Project Narrative Stroke can be a debilitating condition. Only ﬁfty percent of stroke survivors make a full recovery, and that is usually only after extensive rehabilitation. The recovery from stroke and skill learning are probably closely related. We propose to develop brain-computer interface neurofeedback paradigms to facilitate the learning of new skills. If this is effective in our animal subjects it will provide new avenues to explore for stroke rehabilitation.",Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning,9475247,R01HD071686,"['Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Computers', 'Control Animal', 'Couples Therapy', 'Data', 'Electrodes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'arm movement', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain computer interface', 'design', 'forging', 'functional restoration', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'motor learning', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'network architecture', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurofeedback', 'neuromechanism', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'restoration', 'skills', 'stroke model', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'theories', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,441867,-0.06417773694528651
"Neural dynamics and adaption for brain machine interface control Project Summary/Abstract  Millions of people suffer from some form of paralysis. In most of these cases the connection between the brain and the spinal cord is damaged, however, the motor cortex is healthy and intact. Thus, for these individuals, brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) hold significant promise for improving quality of life. BMIs decode an individual's intention to move by utilizing statistical models of neural activity patterns recorded from the motor cortex using implanted electrode arrays. While these methods have been encouraging in preclinical experiments and clinical trials for controlling thought-driven 2D computer cursors, they suffer from poor performance when applied to higher degrees-of-freedom (e.g., robotic limbs), and are not robust to the inevitable degradation of the electrode array. In order to address these clinical needs, this project starts from the recent observation that just as some behaviors are easier to learn, some patterns of neural activity, termed neural states, are also easier to generate. The overarching goal of this project is to elucidate if these “easy to generate” neural states can be used to robustly control a prosthetic arm. This is a significant departure from current decoding methods, which incorporate little to no information about the motor system, especially its ability to learn and adapt. The first major aim of this work is to develop experiments and analysis methods in order to find these “easy to generate” neural states in the non- human primate (i.e., rhesus monkey) motor system. Here “easy to generate” can be understood as the monkey's ability to volitionally generate that particular neural state. The second major aim of this work is to characterize the properties of the motor system that enable some states to be more easily generated than others. Prior work in our lab has shown that motor cortical population activity has well-defined structure, as predicted by dynamical system theory. These dynamics cause neural states to evolve in lawful ways through time. The work here will extend these findings by characterizing the dynamics associated with a monkey learning to generate a neural state. Finally, the third major aim of this work is to determine if neural states that monkeys can volitionally generate can be utilized for robust control of a prosthetic arm. The central hypothesis of this work is that building a model that only utilizes firing patterns that can be easily generated (as determined experimentally) will enable robust and high-performance control of a prosthetic arm. If successful, this study could have significant clinical impact by presenting a new paradigm to enable robust control of a prosthesis. Project Narrative  Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injuries or neurodegenerative diseases that result in considerable movement impairment. Brain machine interfaces (BMIs) hold considerable promise in drastically improving the quality of life for these individuals, who otherwise have very limited treatment options. This work will investigate the motor system's ability to learn and adapt, and directly use these insights to build robust high degree-of-freedom BMIs for clinical applications.",Neural dynamics and adaption for brain machine interface control,9573606,F31NS103409,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Arm', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electrodes', 'Freedom', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Paralysed', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Robotics', 'Spinal Cord', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Volition', 'Work', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'brain machine interface', 'clinical application', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'motor impairment', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'pre-clinical', 'prosthesis control', 'rehearsal', 'relating to nervous system']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,34064,0.05553079894211313
"Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of sensation from the limbs. The past 15 years have seen remarkable advances in “Brain Machine Interfaces” (BMIs) that allow paralyzed persons to move anthropomorphic limbs using signals recorded directly from their brains. However, these movements remain slow, clumsy, and effortful, looking remarkably like those of individuals who have lost sensation from their arms due to peripheral neuropathy. Brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are unlikely to achieve high levels of performance in the absence of artificial sensory feedback. Early attempts at restoring somatosensation used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate somatosensory cortex (s1), requiring animals to learn largely arbitrary patterns of stimulation to represent two or three virtual objects or to navigate in two-dimensional space. While an important beginning, this approach seems unlikely to scale to the broad range of limb movements and interactions with objects that we experience in daily life.  To move the field past this hurdle, we propose to replace both touch and proprioception by using multi- electrode ICMS to produce naturalistic patterns of neuronal activity in S1 of monkeys. In Aim 1, we will develop model-optimized mappings between limb state (pressure on the fingertip, or motion of the limb) and the patterns of ICMS required to evoke S1 activation that mimics that of natural inputs. These maps will account for both the dynamics of neural responses and the biophysics of ICMS. We anticipate that this biomimetic approach will evoke intuitive sensations that require little or no training to interpret. We will validate the maps by comparing natural and ICMS-evoked S1 activity using novel hardware that allows for concurrent ICMS and neural recording. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of monkeys to recognize objects using artificial touch. Having learned to identify real objects by touch, animals will explore virtual objects with an avatar that shadows their own hand movements, receiving artificial touch sensations when the avatar contacts objects. We will test their initial performance on the virtual stereognosis task without learning, as well as their improvements in performance over time. Aim 3 will be similar, but will focus on proprioception. We will train monkeys to report the direction of brief force bumps applied to their hand. After training, we will replace the actual bumps with virtual bumps created by patterned ICMS, again asking the monkeys to report their perceived sense of the direction and magnitude of the perturbation. Finally, in Aim 4, we will temporarily paralyze the monkey's arm, thereby removing both touch and proprioception, mimicking the essential characteristics of a paralyzed patient. The avatar will be controlled based on recordings from motor cortex and guided by artificial somatosensation. The monkey will reach to a set of virtual objects, find one with a particular shape, grasp it, and move it to a new location. If we can demonstrate that this model-optimized, biomimetic feedback is informative and easy to learn, it should form the basis for robust, scalable, somatosensory feedback for BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of feeling from the limbs (somatosensation); brain machine interfaces (BMIs), which record signals directly from the brain, can be used to control prosthetic devices, computers, or environmental controls. However, BMIs currently do not restore somatosensation, a critical component of normal limb movement. We propose to develop a new type of brain interface that will mimic the somatosensory brain activity generated during movement and provide natural and informative artificial sensation for people with paralysis or limb amputation.",Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation,9504668,R01NS095251,"['Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cutaneous', 'Electrodes', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Block', 'Neurons', 'Numbness', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stereognosis', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'infancy', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'microstimulation', 'mind control', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prosthesis control', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory feedback', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual feedback']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,727051,0.05871557050564733
"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synapses between neurons are plastic - able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an ""error signal"" that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers or othe cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circui uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorder, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local ""decisions"" cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit's function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.",Instructive Signals for Motor Learning,9538277,R01NS072406,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of purkinje fibers', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory encoding', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'oculomotor', 'optogenetics', 'paired stimuli', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapy design', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus', 'visual-vestibular']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,477795,0.023453070956173286
"GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT  Human locomotion through natural environments requires the coordination of all levels of the sensorimotor hierarchy, from the cortical areas involved in processing of visual information and high level planning to the subcortical and spinal structures involved in the regulation of the gait and posture. However, despite the complex neural bases of human locomotion, the output is highly regular and well organized around the basic physical dynamics and biomechanics that define the stability and energetic costs of moving a bipedal body through space. There is a rich and growing body of literature describing detailed knowledge each of the individual components of human locomotion, including neural mechanisms, muscular neuromechanics, and biomechanics. However, very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion through a complex and dynamic world. This lack of integrative research not only restricts the breadth of impact of research from these individual disciplines, but also limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, it is necessary to develop an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world. In service of this general goal, this proposal outlines research projects aimed at specific unanswered questions about locomotion over different terrains. This proposal comprises three specific research and training aims on the visual control of locomotion over rough terrain. Aim 1 focuses on the behavioral task itself, Aim 2 investigates the sensory stimulus experienced during real-world locomotion, and Aim 3 examines the motor integration of visually specified goals into the ongoing gait cycle. Aim 1 investigates effects of changing environmental uncertainty and task demands on gaze allocation strategies during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 2 analyzes and models the visual stimulus experienced during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 3 determines how visually specified target footholds and targets are integrated into the ongoing preferred steady-state gait. Together these aims will significantly advance our understanding of how humans use vision to control their movement through the natural world, which greatly increase our ability to develop clinical diagnosis and treatment for loss of locomotor function. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion. This lack of integrative research limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease.

"Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements: characterization and translation to neuroprosthetics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall project goals are to study the cortical network dynamics of human upper limb motor control spanning two distinct spatial scales recorded with electrocorticography (ECoG), and to demonstrate that these dynamics can be estimated in real-time and used to control the JHU Applied Physics Lab Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) during execution of functionally useful complex action sequences.  Our human subjects will be instructed to perform complete functional movements characteristic of activities of daily living.  We will analyze the task-related temporal evolution in the strength and pattern of interactions among large-scale cortical networks known to be recruited in visually-guided reach-to-grasp tasks.  Using multi-scale subdural ECoG with combinations of routine clinical macro-electrodes (2.3 mm diameter, 1 cm spacing) recording activity of broadly spread elements/nodes of neural networks, and inset arrays of microelectrodes (75 μm diameter, 0.9 mm spacing) recording the activity of local sub-networks, we will test our overall hypothesis that there is a functional hierarchy between the two scales (Aim 1).  More specifically, we hypothesize that large-scale network dynamics involving premotor/motor cortex reflect the evolution of sensory-motor processing demands during complex action sequences, while micro-scale population activity and network dynamics in motor cortex reflect the low-level kinematics of these tasks.  We will utilize methods of estimating dynamic effective connectivity developed by our team to study interactions between these scales and test whether there exists a spatially heterogeneous and hierarchical structure within the macro-micro scale networks.  The results of these analyses have wide-ranging clinical implications for both the optimal scale of functional mapping for clinical diagnostic purposes and the extent of implantations for neuroprosthetic control.  We will exploit multi-scale ECoG recordings and online estimates of the dynamics of neural activation and large-scale/local network interactions to achieve control of the MPL during functionally useful tasks (Aim 2).  This approach will go beyond traditional paradigms that have developed neural control over individual degrees of freedom.  We will do this by embedding low-level control within an innovative framework whereby knowledge of task goals supplement direct kinematic decoding.  This project will build on our team's previous successes in implementing a system for semi-autonomous ECoG control of the MPL, employing machine vision and route-planning algorithms, during complex interactions with objects requiring the coordination of multiple joints.  This system will be able to leverage for the first time the rich complexity of temporally and spatially resolved network dynamics correlated with high-level goals to achieve functionally useful control of an advanced neuroprosthetic limb.

"Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice PROJECT SUMMARY We often consider our movements a result of sensory processing – sensation guides behavior. However, animals selectively shape future sensory input through their own actions in a process known as active sampling. Thus, action and sensation are inextricably linked. Despite this, much of the research done on sensory processing restricts movement, most commonly via head fixation. To access sensorimotor processing during more natural behavior, we will study olfactory navigation in freely-moving mice. The olfactory system is ideal for studying sensory sampling, because of its ethological relevance for mammalian foraging and the dynamic nature of airborne odor stimuli. The proposed research will determine the sampling strategies of olfactory search and reveal the underlying circuitry that connects sensation with motion. Aim 1. It is unknown how rodents navigate dynamic plumes of odorant towards an odor source. In this aim, we will identify, analyze, and model active sensing behaviors that occur during increasingly difficult navigation tasks and with single nostrils occluded. These experiments will test the hypothesis that olfactory navigation works as a sensorimotor closed-loop system, where animals optimize sampling behaviors for the current stimulus conditions. These behavioral studies will lay the foundation for investigations of sensorimotor processing in dynamic olfactory scenes. Aim 2. To determine how sampling movements shape sensation, we will monitor neural activity during active sensory behavior. During odor tracking, we will electrophysiologically record in the olfactory bulb, a bottleneck through which all sensory input passes. We will determine the sensory history dependence of active sampling and, in doing so, reveal part of the underlying circuitry that connects motion with sensation. These experiments will test the hypothesis that sampling movements are sensory history dependent. To our knowledge, sampling movements and sensory activity have never been simultaneously recorded during olfactory navigation. This research will advance our understanding of the interplay between sensation and motion during natural behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deficits in sensory motor communication are a major contributor to prevalent neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our assay of olfactory navigation will model the interaction between sensation and movement and identify the circuitry through which movements are decided by sensory input. Discovering mechanisms of sensorimotor integration are the key to a better understanding of sensory processing in these disorders, since sensation and action are inextricably linked.",Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice,9563948,F31DC016799,"['Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Implant', 'Intake', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vertebrates', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'design', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory stimulus', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2018,33530,0.02719316024576176

"Machine Learning-Based Control of Functional Electrical Stimulation Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of quadriplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic. The goal of this project is to develop methods to artificially activate and control paralyzed muscles with electrodes implanted in muscles. This effort will contribute to the restoration of voluntary limb movements in individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke.",Machine Learning-Based Control of Functional Electrical Stimulation,9436952,R56NS096064,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Digit structure', 'Elbow', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Error Sources', 'Experimental Models', 'Fingers', 'Forearm', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Intramuscular', 'Joints', 'Lifting', 'Limb structure', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Space', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Quadriplegia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'design', 'experience', 'finger movement', 'grasp', 'hand grasp', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'neuroprosthesis', 'nonhuman primate', 'response', 'restoration', 'robotic device', 'scapula']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R56,2017,371219,0.08164796613402242
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9244854,R01NS063399,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incentives', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2017,30367,0.02701671825480859
"Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits Project Summary  Of the diverse features of the mammalian motor repertoire, skilled limb movements have become some of the more impressive and indispensable ways of interacting with the environment. The susceptibility of these movements to neurodegenerative disease and injury underscores the need for a better understanding of how neural circuits orchestrate these dexterous behaviors. This goal demands sophisticated experimental scrutiny at both neural and behavioral levels, and while the emergence of genetic tools for monitoring and manipulating neural circuits in mice has been transformative, the development of motor behavioral assays has not kept pace. Typically, a single behavioral test is applied to the question at hand, precluding a more comprehensive description of why relevant neural circuits have evolved their particular anatomical and functional attributes. Moreover, in the study of limb motor control, primate-inspired behavioral paradigms tend to be applied to the mouse by default, risking neglect of a more complete and naturalistic account of motor circuit function.  Ethology emphasizes an unbiased study of behavior under natural conditions. This proposal describes an ethological approach for the quantification and categorization of skilled limb movements in mice, enabling a depth and breadth of behavioral analysis that more closely aligns with the complexity of the underlying neural circuits. Several complementary approaches for unbiased behavioral quantification of mouse limb movements in enriched environments will be developed in parallel: a set of optical techniques enabling automated three- dimensional reconstruction of limb and digit posture and trajectory; and an approach that leverages advances in the miniaturization of motion sensors for camera-free limb tracking that can be integrated seamlessly with neural and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Through iterative refinement, this multifaceted strategy should highlight the strengths and mitigate potential drawbacks of each tracking method, providing a suite of complementary quantitative tools. Kinematic, kinetic, EMG and neural data collected across diverse behavioral contexts will be used to guide machine learning-based classification of natural structure in limb movements and in their underlying neural circuits. As a proving ground for how these naturalistic behavioral analyses can be integrated with the genetic dissection of neural circuit function, a set of molecularly defined motor circuits will be probed using novel optogenetic tools that permit selective inhibition at defined axon collateral terminals. This combination of projection specific genetic perturbation and ethologically driven behavioral analyses will provide a powerful lens through which to view the fine-grained functional organization of mammalian motor circuits. More generally, this merging of molecular and systems neuroscience approaches will offer a novel way to explore and compare fine motor control across species, equipping the field with a more comprehensive and standardized approach to study skilled behavior, and helping lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of behavioral deficits associated with neural circuit dysfunction. Project Narrative Skilled limb movements play a central role in mammalian behavior, from the seemingly mundane to the astoundingly athletic – yet little is known about how specific neural circuits orchestrate limb motor output to ensure precision and dexterity. To identify the neural basis of skilled behaviors, a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of natural limb movements in mice is needed to take better advantage of the powerful genetic accessibility of this model system. The ability to track and define these skilled, natural movements will enable a more sensitive and empirical exploration of the neural control of behavior, and should lay the groundwork for more effective diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits caused by disease or injury.",Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits,9351131,DP2NS105555,"['Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Injury', 'Kinetics', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'dexterity', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'kinematics', 'lens', 'limb movement', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP2,2017,2910000,0.009243904705770137
"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning.

"Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to apply three interventions (epidural stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training) to control the excitability of localized neural circuits in humans with a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their arms and hands.  This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postural and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI.  We will reach critical milestones that will provide the basis for a series of clinical trials for furter defining the efficacy of these interventions.",Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI,9358722,U01EB015521,"['Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Bromocriptine', 'Buspirone', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'FDA approved', 'Felis catus', 'Food', 'Forelimb', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knee', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Oral', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Retrieval', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Upper Extremity', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'arm', 'arm function', 'design', 'human subject', 'improved', 'injured', 'learning strategy', 'minimally invasive', 'motor function recovery', 'motor recovery', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'public health relevance', 'response']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2017,865006,0.0796889592334056
"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We now have demonstrated that the human lumbosacral spinal cord can be neuromodulated with epidural stimulation to enable recovery of standing and volitional control of the lower limbs and return of some autonomic function after complete motor paralysis.

"A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis Project Summary  The goal of the proposed work is to develop a robust hybrid neural-machine interface (NMI), combining brain and muscle signals, to improve overall control of a lower limb prosthetic device during activities of daily living. Limb amputation affects over 600,000 individuals annually in the US, and is a major cause of physical disability that causes activities of daily living to become difficult or impossible for the amputee. The limitations of current lower-limb prostheses are associated with limited volitional control, reduced mobility, and chronic gait abnormalities, which have been linked to exhaustion from increased energy expenditure, increased risk of falling, and degenerative bone and joint disorders in both the intact and amputated limb. In this study, EMG signals from both residual and intact lower limbs and EEG signals from the cortex are leveraged to decode transitions to and from various modes of locomotion modes in able-bodied individuals and transfemoral amputees, and to provide a global understanding of movement at the cortical, muscular, and kinematic level in amputees. Specifically, time and frequency domain features are leveraged to create a prediction algorithm capable of identifying upcoming terrain transitions in advance. In lower limb amputees, this hybrid NMI paradigm translates to volitional control of a powered lower-limb prosthesis, which allows for seamless transitions between various movement conditions. The high-level of control is expected to result in significant increases in level of activity and overall improvements in gait. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of EEG or EMG based NMIs for orthotic and prosthetic devices; however, no study to date has integrated EEG and EMG in a NMI for powered lower limb prostheses. This study is motivated by the need to explore advanced neural control sources for intuitive control of artificial limbs.  This project aligns directly with the Mission & Goals of the NIH, the Brain Initiative, and NIH’s Blueprint Program by expanding fundamental knowledge of neuroscience, human, health and wellness; by utilizing an innovative research strategy; and ultimately returning the knowledge to the public through the development of a highly advanced medical technology. Furthermore, the technology developed through this work has implications beyond the amputee population in the treatment of many neurological conditions and injuries, such as in neurorehabilitation after stroke. The innovation of this project lies in the novel approach of using multimodal neural signals and movement synergies as a framework for interpreting movement of the lower limb. The scientific impact is realized by a greater understanding of the neural correlates of movement after lower-limb amputation. The direct clinical significance for the patient can be measured directly through improved gait performance and walking confidence, leading to increased mobility and a reduced risk of falling, exhaustion, and bone and joint disorders. Project Narrative  The development of a hybrid neural-machine interface that incorporates muscle and brain signaling for communication with robotic systems is important to public health because it allows for robust volitional control of powered prostheses and exoskeletons during activities of daily living. This will directly benefit the amputee population by allowing better control of their prosthesis during locomotion, especially when navigating complex terrains, such as stairs and inclines. The implications of this technology can be used beyond the amputee population to further understand the effect of neurological injuries on the brain, and for improving rehabilitation paradigms associated with their treatment.",A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis,9470585,F99NS105210,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Amputees', 'Ankle', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Body Image', 'Bone Diseases', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Electronic Mail', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Agency', 'Future Teacher', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Neurosciences', 'Oral', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prosthesis', 'Public Health', 'Ramp', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Robotics', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Volition', 'Walking', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'exhaustion', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel strategies', 'posters', 'powered prosthesis', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'rehabilitation paradigm', 'relating to nervous system', 'robot control', 'robot exoskeleton', 'robot rehabilitation', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'undergraduate student', 'visual motor']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,F99,2017,36029,0.056092115484414194
"Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning Project Summary Behavior and cognition emerge from the coordinated activity of populations of interacting neurons. To change behavior we must change the architecture of the network that drives behavior. What are the rules whereby the activity of populations of neurons can change during learning? If we could observe the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning, we might be able to facilitate learning. This ability may eventually lead to improvements to neurally- based rehabilitation strategies that can facilitate the recovery from stroke.  We will use a neurofeedback paradigm to shape the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning. To do this, we will record the activity of dozens of neurons in the motor cortex of Rhesus monkey subjects. Animals will control a cursor on a computer screen by generating neural command signals. This is neurofeedback because the animal directly observes a projection of his neural activity, in the form of the movement of the onscreen cursor. This paradigm allows us to study learning simply by perturbing the mapping from neural activity to cursor movement on the screen. Following such a perturbation the animal must discover how to generate new patterns of neural activity that are now appropriate to restore good control of the onscreen cursor.  We will ask two linked questions. First, how does the animal learn to generate new patterns of neural activity? And second, can we facilitate that process? Neurofeedback-based learning offers complementary advantages to arm movements for studying the neural population dynamics that accompany learning. Chieﬂy, only in a neurofeedback paradigm can we be certain that the learning-induced changes in neural activity we observe matter directly for behavior, because only the neurons we record directly impact behavior in this paradigm.  We will test classic theories of skill learning, converted into speciﬁc hypotheses about how neural activity patterns will change throughout the multi-day course of skill learning.  If our neurofeedback-based incremental training schemes do facilitate learning, then this research will inform the work of rehabilitation specialists who work with stroke patients. We (and others) believe that if neurofeedback-based therapies are coupled with standard behavioral therapies for stroke, rehabilitation outcomes will improve. Project Narrative Stroke can be a debilitating condition. Only ﬁfty percent of stroke survivors make a full recovery, and that is usually only after extensive rehabilitation. The recovery from stroke and skill learning are probably closely related. We propose to develop brain-computer interface neurofeedback paradigms to facilitate the learning of new skills. If this is effective in our animal subjects it will provide new avenues to explore for stroke rehabilitation.",Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning,9309921,R01HD071686,"['Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Computers', 'Control Animal', 'Couples Therapy', 'Data', 'Electrodes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'arm movement', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain computer interface', 'design', 'forging', 'functional restoration', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'motor learning', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'network architecture', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurofeedback', 'neuromechanism', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'restoration', 'skills', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'theories', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,453274,-0.06417773694528651
"Neural dynamics and adaption for brain machine interface control Project Summary/Abstract  Millions of people suffer from some form of paralysis. In most of these cases the connection between the brain and the spinal cord is damaged, however, the motor cortex is healthy and intact. Thus, for these individuals, brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) hold significant promise for improving quality of life. BMIs decode an individual's intention to move by utilizing statistical models of neural activity patterns recorded from the motor cortex using implanted electrode arrays. While these methods have been encouraging in preclinical experiments and clinical trials for controlling thought-driven 2D computer cursors, they suffer from poor performance when applied to higher degrees-of-freedom (e.g., robotic limbs), and are not robust to the inevitable degradation of the electrode array. In order to address these clinical needs, this project starts from the recent observation that just as some behaviors are easier to learn, some patterns of neural activity, termed neural states, are also easier to generate. The overarching goal of this project is to elucidate if these “easy to generate” neural states can be used to robustly control a prosthetic arm. This is a significant departure from current decoding methods, which incorporate little to no information about the motor system, especially its ability to learn and adapt. The first major aim of this work is to develop experiments and analysis methods in order to find these “easy to generate” neural states in the non- human primate (i.e., rhesus monkey) motor system. Here “easy to generate” can be understood as the monkey's ability to volitionally generate that particular neural state. The second major aim of this work is to characterize the properties of the motor system that enable some states to be more easily generated than others. Prior work in our lab has shown that motor cortical population activity has well-defined structure, as predicted by dynamical system theory. These dynamics cause neural states to evolve in lawful ways through time. The work here will extend these findings by characterizing the dynamics associated with a monkey learning to generate a neural state. Finally, the third major aim of this work is to determine if neural states that monkeys can volitionally generate can be utilized for robust control of a prosthetic arm. The central hypothesis of this work is that building a model that only utilizes firing patterns that can be easily generated (as determined experimentally) will enable robust and high-performance control of a prosthetic arm. If successful, this study could have significant clinical impact by presenting a new paradigm to enable robust control of a prosthesis. Project Narrative  Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injuries or neurodegenerative diseases that result in considerable movement impairment. Brain machine interfaces (BMIs) hold considerable promise in drastically improving the quality of life for these individuals, who otherwise have very limited treatment options. This work will investigate the motor system's ability to learn and adapt, and directly use these insights to build robust high degree-of-freedom BMIs for clinical applications.",Neural dynamics and adaption for brain machine interface control,9395809,F31NS103409,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Arm', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electrodes', 'Freedom', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Paralysed', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Robotics', 'Spinal Cord', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Volition', 'Work', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'brain machine interface', 'clinical application', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'motor impairment', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'pre-clinical', 'prosthesis control', 'rehearsal', 'relating to nervous system']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,33584,0.05553079894211313
"Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of sensation from the limbs. The past 15 years have seen remarkable advances in “Brain Machine Interfaces” (BMIs) that allow paralyzed persons to move anthropomorphic limbs using signals recorded directly from their brains. However, these movements remain slow, clumsy, and effortful, looking remarkably like those of individuals who have lost sensation from their arms due to peripheral neuropathy. Brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are unlikely to achieve high levels of performance in the absence of artificial sensory feedback. Early attempts at restoring somatosensation used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate somatosensory cortex (s1), requiring animals to learn largely arbitrary patterns of stimulation to represent two or three virtual objects or to navigate in two-dimensional space. While an important beginning, this approach seems unlikely to scale to the broad range of limb movements and interactions with objects that we experience in daily life.  To move the field past this hurdle, we propose to replace both touch and proprioception by using multi- electrode ICMS to produce naturalistic patterns of neuronal activity in S1 of monkeys. In Aim 1, we will develop model-optimized mappings between limb state (pressure on the fingertip, or motion of the limb) and the patterns of ICMS required to evoke S1 activation that mimics that of natural inputs. These maps will account for both the dynamics of neural responses and the biophysics of ICMS. We anticipate that this biomimetic approach will evoke intuitive sensations that require little or no training to interpret. We will validate the maps by comparing natural and ICMS-evoked S1 activity using novel hardware that allows for concurrent ICMS and neural recording. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of monkeys to recognize objects using artificial touch. Having learned to identify real objects by touch, animals will explore virtual objects with an avatar that shadows their own hand movements, receiving artificial touch sensations when the avatar contacts objects. We will test their initial performance on the virtual stereognosis task without learning, as well as their improvements in performance over time. Aim 3 will be similar, but will focus on proprioception. We will train monkeys to report the direction of brief force bumps applied to their hand. After training, we will replace the actual bumps with virtual bumps created by patterned ICMS, again asking the monkeys to report their perceived sense of the direction and magnitude of the perturbation. Finally, in Aim 4, we will temporarily paralyze the monkey's arm, thereby removing both touch and proprioception, mimicking the essential characteristics of a paralyzed patient. The avatar will be controlled based on recordings from motor cortex and guided by artificial somatosensation. The monkey will reach to a set of virtual objects, find one with a particular shape, grasp it, and move it to a new location. If we can demonstrate that this model-optimized, biomimetic feedback is informative and easy to learn, it should form the basis for robust, scalable, somatosensory feedback for BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of feeling from the limbs (somatosensation); brain machine interfaces (BMIs), which record signals directly from the brain, can be used to control prosthetic devices, computers, or environmental controls. However, BMIs currently do not restore somatosensation, a critical component of normal limb movement. We propose to develop a new type of brain interface that will mimic the somatosensory brain activity generated during movement and provide natural and informative artificial sensation for people with paralysis or limb amputation.",Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation,9277595,R01NS095251,"['Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cutaneous', 'Electrodes', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Block', 'Neurons', 'Numbness', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stereognosis', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'infancy', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'microstimulation', 'mind control', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prosthesis control', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory feedback', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual feedback']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,825202,0.05871557050564733
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,9265960,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'rapid diagnosis', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment response', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,577180,0.02124177427342769
"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synapses between neurons are plastic - able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an ""error signal"" that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers or othe cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circui uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorder, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local ""decisions"" cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit's function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.",Instructive Signals for Motor Learning,9324362,R01NS072406,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Plasticizers', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of purkinje fibers', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory encoding', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'oculomotor', 'optogenetics', 'paired stimuli', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapy design', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus', 'visual-vestibular']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,479269,0.023453070956173286
"Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements: characterization and translation to neuroprosthetics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall project goals are to study the cortical network dynamics of human upper limb motor control spanning two distinct spatial scales recorded with electrocorticography (ECoG), and to demonstrate that these dynamics can be estimated in real-time and used to control the JHU Applied Physics Lab Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) during execution of functionally useful complex action sequences.  Our human subjects will be instructed to perform complete functional movements characteristic of activities of daily living.  We will analyze the task-related temporal evolution in the strength and pattern of interactions among large-scale cortical networks known to be recruited in visually-guided reach-to-grasp tasks.  Using multi-scale subdural ECoG with combinations of routine clinical macro-electrodes (2.3 mm diameter, 1 cm spacing) recording activity of broadly spread elements/nodes of neural networks, and inset arrays of microelectrodes (75 μm diameter, 0.9 mm spacing) recording the activity of local sub-networks, we will test our overall hypothesis that there is a functional hierarchy between the two scales (Aim 1).  More specifically, we hypothesize that large-scale network dynamics involving premotor/motor cortex reflect the evolution of sensory-motor processing demands during complex action sequences, while micro-scale population activity and network dynamics in motor cortex reflect the low-level kinematics of these tasks.  We will utilize methods of estimating dynamic effective connectivity developed by our team to study interactions between these scales and test whether there exists a spatially heterogeneous and hierarchical structure within the macro-micro scale networks.  The results of these analyses have wide-ranging clinical implications for both the optimal scale of functional mapping for clinical diagnostic purposes and the extent of implantations for neuroprosthetic control.  We will exploit multi-scale ECoG recordings and online estimates of the dynamics of neural activation and large-scale/local network interactions to achieve control of the MPL during functionally useful tasks (Aim 2).  This approach will go beyond traditional paradigms that have developed neural control over individual degrees of freedom.  We will do this by embedding low-level control within an innovative framework whereby knowledge of task goals supplement direct kinematic decoding.  This project will build on our team's previous successes in implementing a system for semi-autonomous ECoG control of the MPL, employing machine vision and route-planning algorithms, during complex interactions with objects requiring the coordination of multiple joints.  This system will be able to leverage for the first time the rich complexity of temporally and spatially resolved network dynamics correlated with high-level goals to achieve functionally useful control of an advanced neuroprosthetic limb.

"Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice PROJECT SUMMARY We often consider our movements a result of sensory processing – sensation guides behavior. However, animals selectively shape future sensory input through their own actions in a process known as active sampling. Thus, action and sensation are inextricably linked. Despite this, much of the research done on sensory processing restricts movement, most commonly via head fixation. To access sensorimotor processing during more natural behavior, we will study olfactory navigation in freely-moving mice. The olfactory system is ideal for studying sensory sampling, because of its ethological relevance for mammalian foraging and the dynamic nature of airborne odor stimuli. The proposed research will determine the sampling strategies of olfactory search and reveal the underlying circuitry that connects sensation with motion. Aim 1. It is unknown how rodents navigate dynamic plumes of odorant towards an odor source. In this aim, we will identify, analyze, and model active sensing behaviors that occur during increasingly difficult navigation tasks and with single nostrils occluded. These experiments will test the hypothesis that olfactory navigation works as a sensorimotor closed-loop system, where animals optimize sampling behaviors for the current stimulus conditions. These behavioral studies will lay the foundation for investigations of sensorimotor processing in dynamic olfactory scenes. Aim 2. To determine how sampling movements shape sensation, we will monitor neural activity during active sensory behavior. During odor tracking, we will electrophysiologically record in the olfactory bulb, a bottleneck through which all sensory input passes. We will determine the sensory history dependence of active sampling and, in doing so, reveal part of the underlying circuitry that connects motion with sensation. These experiments will test the hypothesis that sampling movements are sensory history dependent. To our knowledge, sampling movements and sensory activity have never been simultaneously recorded during olfactory navigation. This research will advance our understanding of the interplay between sensation and motion during natural behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deficits in sensory motor communication are a major contributor to prevalent neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our assay of olfactory navigation will model the interaction between sensation and movement and identify the circuitry through which movements are decided by sensory input. Discovering mechanisms of sensorimotor integration are the key to a better understanding of sensory processing in these disorders, since sensation and action are inextricably linked.",Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice,9470632,F31DC016799,"['Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Implant', 'Intake', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vertebrates', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'design', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory stimulus', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2017,33050,0.02719316024576176
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9618453,R01NS063399,[' '],NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,273292,0.02701671825480859
"A Clinical 3D Movement Analysis System for Assessing Lower Extremity Injury Risk and Recovery in Athletes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The mission of Bioniks is to develop and commercialize accurate, low-cost movement analysis systems for clinicians, ergonomists, athletic trainers, and other professionals interested in quantifying human movement. Our initial focus is on developing computer enhancements for inexpensive 3D cameras like the Microsoft Kinect. These enhancements surpass the accuracy limitations of state-of-the-art ""skeleton"" by combining established marker-based measurement protocols and advanced computer vision techniques, to generate clinical-quality 3D human motion data.  Difficult to obtain outside a laboratory setting, these kinematic data are inherently valuable for several NIH priority areas: 1) assessment of function and fatigability in older adults (NIA); 2) measurement of gait and posture biomechanics to monitor patients (NIAMS); 3) tools to enable mobile health and telemedicine by providing a means to monitor, evaluate, manage, track, train, and treat patients in underserved community settings and rural and remote locations (NIMHD, NINR); 4) tools for health informatics for clinical and translational research (NCATS); and 5) measurement of occupational health stressors in the workplace (NIOSH).  For this Phase I STTR, Bioniks' goal is to provide therapists with an affordable and easy-to-use 3D movement analysis system that quantifies an athlete's risk for, or recovery from, lower extremity injury. Our first aim is to show that the movement analysis system will not only be accurate and reliable (Aim 1), but also be practical and easy to use (Aim 2). We hypothesize that: 1) our kinematic measurements will agree with those from a gold-standard laboratory-based motion capture system (Vicon); and 2) that therapists will judge our system to be more useful and usable than current clinical tools, including traditional 2D video analyses. To test these hypotheses, we will conduct a validation study with healthy volunteers at the UCSF Human Performance Center as well as a pilot usability study with therapists and healthy volunteers and patients with history of ACL injury at the SF Sports and Spine Physical Therapy Clinic.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Because of the high cost and perceived ineffectiveness of traditional musculoskeletal care, there is growing pressure on health care professionals to provide more cost- effective treatments as well as to validate treatment effectiveness. Bioniks has the opportunity to be the first clinic-based tool that quantitatively and objectively assesses musculoskeletal function of patients over the course of treatment and rehabilitation. This STTR proposal focuses on quantification of an athlete's risk for, and recovery from, lower extremity injury.                ",A Clinical 3D Movement Analysis System for Assessing Lower Extremity Injury Risk and Recovery in Athletes,9046038,R41AR068202,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Anterior Cruciate Ligament', 'Area', 'Athletic', 'Biomechanics', 'Boxing', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Drops', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knee Injuries', 'Laboratories', 'Leg', 'Length', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Nature', 'Occupational Health', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Series', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Sports', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Video Games', 'Workplace', 'anterior cruciate ligament rupture', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'commercialization', 'community setting', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'healthy volunteer', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'ligament injury', 'mHealth', 'meetings', 'modifiable risk', 'movement analysis', 'neuromuscular function', 'physical therapist', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'stressor', 'tool', 'usability', 'validation studies', 'volunteer']",NIAMS,"BIONIKS, INC.",R41,2016,215600,0.013164940682079412
"The neural workings of self-initiated and quasi-automatic movements ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uncovering the principles behind the generation of voluntary movements is a necessary first step in the development of technologies and treatments aimed at restoring motor abilities lost to neurological disease or trauma. The aim of this project is to shed light on the neural mechanisms of voluntary movement initiation. An essential component of voluntary movement is the choice of when to act. Under normal circumstances this decision can be time consuming usually taking up to a few hundreds of milliseconds, longer that the known delays in the nervous system. The area of the brain most associated with generating movements, the motor cortex, becomes very active just before and during the movement, however what exactly is happening during this time is still not well understood. Indeed, while much is known about the neural basis of generating movements, several open questions remain: does a movement generated deliberately with no time pressure, like a reach made to grab an object from a table, share the same neural underpinnings with a very fast reach to catch a falling object? Will the motor cortex be just as active before a quasi-automatic reach when time is of the essence? Or is pre-movement activity only present when there is enough time to deliberately plan the movement? During movement itself, is motor cortex involved in generating quasi-automatic reaches or is there is some reflex mechanism that bypasses motor cortex to generate urgent reaches? To begin answering these questions we have trained two monkeys to initiate a reach under three very different circumstances: sometimes monkeys move at a time of their own choosing with no imposed time constraints, other times monkeys must intercept a rapidly moving target on a screen, which elicits very short-latency reaches. In yet another set of trials monkeys must withhold a reach until given a go cue. The first aim of this project is to determine if these three movements (self-initiated, quasi-automatic and cue-initiated) share a common neural mechanism that does not depend on how the movement is initiated. To do this we will record the responses from a number of neurons in two key regions of the motor cortex: the primary motor and dorsal premotor cortex. In order to understand and interpret these responses, we will employ cutting edge machine learning techniques that will allow us to visualize and quantify the how neural activity evolves in time. Being able to visualize the evolution of neural activity is a key component in understanding the principles that govern how the neural activity translates to movement. The second aim of this project is to elucidate the role that higher cortical areas play in the generation of voluntar movements. We will record neural activity from areas upstream of motor cortex (supplementary motor area), which is heavily interconnected with the motor cortex and is suspected to play crucial a role in determining when a movement should be initiated. We will test record neural activity from this area and characterize its properties using the same cutting edge techniques developed in the first part of this project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Uncovering the principles behind the generation of voluntary movements is a necessary first step in the development of technologies and treatments aimed at restoring motor abilities lost to neurological disease or trauma. Arguably, one of the fundamental features of voluntary movement is that one chooses when to move.

"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning. Deep understanding of sensory-motor systems will aid in development of new treatment modalities for diseases that impair motor function, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. n/a","CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling",9242184,R01NS100049,"['Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Huntington Disease', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'control theory', 'cost', 'experience', 'functional plasticity', 'information processing', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mathematical analysis', 'medical schools', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'research study', 'sensorimotor system', 'signal processing', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,205290,0.024624673155081368
"Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis.

"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We now have demonstrated that the human lumbosacral spinal cord can be neuromodulated with epidural stimulation to enable recovery of standing and volitional control of the lower limbs and return of some autonomic function after complete motor paralysis.  Therefore, our objectives are now to develop the technologies needed to more fully capitalize on this clinical potential and develop home-use technologies to do so.",Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI,9134137,U01EB007615,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bladder Control', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Contusions', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrodes', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intramuscular', 'Learning', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Sensory', 'Sex Functioning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord transection injury', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Training', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'motor control', 'motor function improvement', 'motor function recovery', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'somatosensory', 'treadmill', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2016,1090691,0.09310700945794884
"Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of sensation from the limbs. The past 15 years have seen remarkable advances in “Brain Machine Interfaces” (BMIs) that allow paralyzed persons to move anthropomorphic limbs using signals recorded directly from their brains. However, these movements remain slow, clumsy, and effortful, looking remarkably like those of individuals who have lost sensation from their arms due to peripheral neuropathy. Brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are unlikely to achieve high levels of performance in the absence of artificial sensory feedback. Early attempts at restoring somatosensation used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate somatosensory cortex (s1), requiring animals to learn largely arbitrary patterns of stimulation to represent two or three virtual objects or to navigate in two-dimensional space. While an important beginning, this approach seems unlikely to scale to the broad range of limb movements and interactions with objects that we experience in daily life.  To move the field past this hurdle, we propose to replace both touch and proprioception by using multi- electrode ICMS to produce naturalistic patterns of neuronal activity in S1 of monkeys. In Aim 1, we will develop model-optimized mappings between limb state (pressure on the fingertip, or motion of the limb) and the patterns of ICMS required to evoke S1 activation that mimics that of natural inputs. These maps will account for both the dynamics of neural responses and the biophysics of ICMS. We anticipate that this biomimetic approach will evoke intuitive sensations that require little or no training to interpret. We will validate the maps by comparing natural and ICMS-evoked S1 activity using novel hardware that allows for concurrent ICMS and neural recording. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of monkeys to recognize objects using artificial touch. Having learned to identify real objects by touch, animals will explore virtual objects with an avatar that shadows their own hand movements, receiving artificial touch sensations when the avatar contacts objects. We will test their initial performance on the virtual stereognosis task without learning, as well as their improvements in performance over time. Aim 3 will be similar, but will focus on proprioception. We will train monkeys to report the direction of brief force bumps applied to their hand. After training, we will replace the actual bumps with virtual bumps created by patterned ICMS, again asking the monkeys to report their perceived sense of the direction and magnitude of the perturbation. Finally, in Aim 4, we will temporarily paralyze the monkey's arm, thereby removing both touch and proprioception, mimicking the essential characteristics of a paralyzed patient. The avatar will be controlled based on recordings from motor cortex and guided by artificial somatosensation. The monkey will reach to a set of virtual objects, find one with a particular shape, grasp it, and move it to a new location. If we can demonstrate that this model-optimized, biomimetic feedback is informative and easy to learn, it should form the basis for robust, scalable, somatosensory feedback for BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of feeling from the limbs (somatosensation); brain machine interfaces (BMIs), which record signals directly from the brain, can be used to control prosthetic devices, computers, or environmental controls. However, BMIs currently do not restore somatosensation, a critical component of normal limb movement. We propose to develop a new type of brain interface that will mimic the somatosensory brain activity generated during movement and provide natural and informative artificial sensation for people with paralysis or limb amputation.",Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation,9177620,R01NS095251,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cutaneous', 'Electrodes', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Block', 'Neurons', 'Numbness', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Records Controls', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stereognosis', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'grasp', 'improved', 'infancy', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'microstimulation', 'mind control', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory feedback', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual feedback']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,891206,0.05871557050564733
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,9052846,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment response', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,1,0.02124177427342769
"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synapses between neurons are plastic - able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an ""error signal"" that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers or othe cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circui uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorder, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local ""decisions"" cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit's function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.",Instructive Signals for Motor Learning,9113674,R01NS072406,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory encoding', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'oculomotor', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'therapy design', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,476856,0.023453070956173286
"Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements: characterization and DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall project goals are to study the cortical network dynamics of human upper limb motor control spanning two distinct spatial scales recorded with electrocorticography (ECoG), and to demonstrate that these dynamics can be estimated in real-time and used to control the JHU Applied Physics Lab Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) during execution of functionally useful complex action sequences.  Our human subjects will be instructed to perform complete functional movements characteristic of activities of daily living.  We will analyze the task-related temporal evolution in the strength and pattern o interactions among large-scale cortical networks known to be recruited in visually-guided reach-to-grasp tasks.  Using multi-scale subdural ECoG with combinations of routine clinical macro-electrodes (2.3 mm diameter, 1 cm spacing) recording activity of broadly spread elements/nodes of neural networks, and inset arrays of microelectrodes (75 �m diameter, 0.9 mm spacing) recording the activity of local sub-networks, we will test our overall hypothesis that there is a functional hierarchy between the two scales (Aim 1).  More specifically, we hypothesize that large-scale network dynamics involving premotor/motor cortex reflect the evolution of sensory-motor processing demands during complex action sequences, while micro-scale population activity and network dynamics in motor cortex reflect the low-level kinematics of these tasks.  We will utilize methods of estimating dynamic effective connectivity developed by our team to study interactions between these scales and test whether there exists a spatially heterogeneous and hierarchical structure within the macro-micro scale networks.  The results of these analyses have wide-ranging clinical implications for both the optimal scale of functional mapping for clinical diagnostic purposes and the extent of implantations for neuroprosthetic control.  We will exploit multi-scale ECoG recordings and online estimates of the dynamics of neural activation and large-scale/local network interactions to achieve control of the MPL during functionally useful tasks (Aim 2).  This approach will go beyond traditional paradigms that have developed neural control over individual degrees of freedom.  We will do this by embedding low-level control within an innovative framework whereby knowledge of task goals supplement direct kinematic decoding.  This project will build on our team's previous successes in implementing a system for semi-autonomous ECoG control of the MPL, employing machine vision and route-planning algorithms, during complex interactions with objects requiring the coordination of multiple joints.  This system will be able to leverage for the first time the rich complexity of temporally and spatially resolved network dynamics correlated with high-level goals to achieve functionally useful control of an advanced neuroprosthetic limb. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For ""Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements:  characterization and translation in neuroprosthetics"" This project will use recordings from the surface of the human brain to study how brain networks control arm and hand movements.

"The neural workings of self-initiated and quasi-automatic movements ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uncovering the principles behind the generation of voluntary movements is a necessary first step in the development of technologies and treatments aimed at restoring motor abilities lost to neurological disease or trauma. The aim of this project is to shed light on the neural mechanisms of voluntary movement initiation. An essential component of voluntary movement is the choice of when to act. Under normal circumstances this decision can be time consuming usually taking up to a few hundreds of milliseconds, longer that the known delays in the nervous system. The area of the brain most associated with generating movements, the motor cortex, becomes very active just before and during the movement, however what exactly is happening during this time is still not well understood. Indeed, while much is known about the neural basis of generating movements, several open questions remain: does a movement generated deliberately with no time pressure, like a reach made to grab an object from a table, share the same neural underpinnings with a very fast reach to catch a falling object? Will the motor cortex be just as active before a quasi-automatic reach when time is of the essence? Or is pre-movement activity only present when there is enough time to deliberately plan the movement? During movement itself, is motor cortex involved in generating quasi-automatic reaches or is there is some reflex mechanism that bypasses motor cortex to generate urgent reaches? To begin answering these questions we have trained two monkeys to initiate a reach under three very different circumstances: sometimes monkeys move at a time of their own choosing with no imposed time constraints, other times monkeys must intercept a rapidly moving target on a screen, which elicits very short-latency reaches. In yet another set of trials monkeys must withhold a reach until given a go cue. The first aim of this project is to determine if these three movements (self-initiated, quasi-automatic and cue-initiated) share a common neural mechanism that does not depend on how the movement is initiated. To do this we will record the responses from a number of neurons in two key regions of the motor cortex: the primary motor and dorsal premotor cortex. In order to understand and interpret these responses, we will employ cutting edge machine learning techniques that will allow us to visualize and quantify the how neural activity evolves in time. Being able to visualize the evolution of neural activity is a key component in understanding the principles that govern how the neural activity translates to movement. The second aim of this project is to elucidate the role that higher cortical areas play in the generation of voluntar movements. We will record neural activity from areas upstream of motor cortex (supplementary motor area), which is heavily interconnected with the motor cortex and is suspected to play crucial a role in determining when a movement should be initiated. We will test record neural activity from this area and characterize its properties using the same cutting edge techniques developed in the first part of this project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Uncovering the principles behind the generation of voluntary movements is a necessary first step in the development of technologies and treatments aimed at restoring motor abilities lost to neurological disease or trauma. Arguably, one of the fundamental features of voluntary movement is that one chooses when to move. The main goal of the proposed project is to shed light on the neural mechanisms responsible for voluntary movement initiation.                ",The neural workings of self-initiated and quasi-automatic movements,9051023,F32NS092350,"['Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Bypass', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dorsal', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Intercept', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Property Rights', 'Reflex action', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'falls', 'grasp', 'millisecond', 'motor control', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'technology development']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2015,57962,0.0959862356254759
"Wrist/Grasp Muscle Activity Patterns for EMG-neural Interface Prosthesis Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Simultaneous wrist/hand control (where a person simultaneously moves his/her wrist while grasping or  releasing), is essential in activities of daiy living, but cannot be performed by amputees using clinical surface  electromyography (sEMG) based neural interfaces (myoelectric control). Transradial amputees, who make up 40% of major amputations (proximal to the wrist), cite simultaneous control as a necessary element to improve upper-limb prostheses. Our long-term goal is to develop a clinically viable EMG-based neural interface for transradial amputees that is suitable for restoring simultaneous control of prosthetic wrist/hand movements.   One proposed method for intuitive simultaneous wrist/hand prosthesis control uses intramuscular EMG  (imEMG) amplitude estimates from multiple agonist/ antagonist forearm muscle pairs to control physiologically  appropriate degrees of freedom DOFs (e.g. flexor digitorum profundus / extensor digitorum control  grasp/release). Known as 'direct control', this approach does not require burdensome levels of machine  learning algorithm training, as is required for experimental sEMG-based simultaneous control methods.  However, this method assumes independently modulated muscle activation patterns for each DOF - that the activation patterns of muscles controlling a DOF (i.e. finger flexors/extensors for grasp/release) do not change when a second DOF is simultaneously attempted (simultaneous pronation/supination and grasp/release). The biologic foundation of such an assumption has not been explored to date. Little is known of how the central nervous system (CNS) coordinates wrist and extrinsic hand muscle activation when independent of biomechanical effects and joint position feedback. Muscle activation patterns under such conditions are particularly relevant to amputee populations, who lack distal joints. Therefore, the objective of this research is to better understand how the CNS coordinates muscle activation patterns in healthy individuals to produce simultaneous wrist/grasp torques when independent of the biomechanical effects of joint movement. We will then apply this information to develop an imEMG simultaneous myoelectric prosthesis controller.  imEMG patterns will be measured as healthy subjects produce single-DOF and simultaneous multi-DOF (SMD) wrist and/or grasp/release torques in isometric, neutral posture conditions. Multivariate models predicting imEMG activity from measured wrist/grasp torques will be developed and will suggest which DOFs have independently modulated muscle activation patterns. This information will then allow for the development of a 'biologically-inspired' simultaneous controller. DOFs with independently modulated muscle activation patterns will be controlled using direct control, while experimental pattern recognition algorithms currently used for sEMG-based simultaneous control will be used for all other DOFs. We will evaluate the performance of this hybrid controller in healthy subjects both offline and using online functional tests in a virtual environment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Various current prosthetic arms use the electrical signals produced when muscles contract to control prosthesis movement, but cannot provide simultaneous control of both the wrist and the hand. This study will investigate how the nervous system activates muscles to simultaneously control the wrist and hand in healthy individuals. This information can then be used to provide clinically viable methods of controlling simultaneous wrist and hand movements of prostheses to amputees.",Wrist/Grasp Muscle Activity Patterns for EMG-neural Interface Prosthesis Control,8806616,F31NS083166,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Arm', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Educational Status', 'Electromyography', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Flexor', 'Forearm', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intramuscular', 'Isometric Exercise', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Myoelectric prosthesis', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Pronation', 'Prosthesis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supination', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Torque', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'base', 'design', 'extensor digitorum', 'grasp', 'improved', 'joint mobilization', 'myoelectric control', 'prosthesis control', 'prosthetic hand', 'relating to nervous system', 'residual limb', 'success', 'virtual']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2015,6800,0.060805286076852524
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.                ",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,8887443,R01NS063399,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2015,339124,0.02701671825480859
"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home.

"Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to apply three interventions (epidural stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training) to control the excitability of localized neural circuits in humans with a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their arms and hands.  This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postural and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI.  We will reach critical milestones that will provide the basis for a series of clinical trials for furter defining the efficacy of these interventions.",Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI,8889256,U01EB015521,"['Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Bromocriptine', 'Buspirone', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'FDA approved', 'Felis catus', 'Food', 'Forelimb', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knee', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Oral', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Retrieval', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Upper Extremity', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'arm', 'arm function', 'base', 'design', 'human subject', 'improved', 'minimally invasive', 'motor function recovery', 'motor recovery', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'response']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2015,828196,0.0796889592334056
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,8839318,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,577490,0.02124177427342769
"Fully Implantable and Programmable Spike-based Codecs for Neuroprosthetics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Often the disability is so severe that it is not possible to feed oneself or readily communicate. A new class of medical system termed brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) has emerged from research labs in the past decade and is now poised to dramatically improve these patients' quality of life. BMIs ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decode these electrical impulses in order to determine the intended movement. Initial versions of BMI systems that control a computer cursor are now in FDA Phase-I clinical trials, and numerous agencies are actively engaged in clinical translation (e.g., NIH, DARPA, VA). Creating control signals to enable an amputee to feed himself with a prosthetic (robotic) arm and hand will require decoding signals from thousands of electrodes, rather than the hundred or so signals current systems read, as well as encoding thousands of sensor signals from the arm and hand into thousands of artificial neural signals to be ""written into"" the brain, which has not yet been attempted. The lack of low-power (so that it can be implanted) electronic circuitry needed to run BMIs' encoding and decoding algorithms (termed codecs) is a fundamental barrier to successful clinical translation. The technologies available until now are too power-hungry (digital) or too algorithmically inflexible (analog) to meet the challenge. Recent advances in neuromorphic engineering make it now possible to build a fully implantable and programmable codec chip. This innovative approach combines digital's and analog's best features-programmability and efficiency-while offering far greater robustness than either. Meanwhile recent advances in neuroscience techniques make it now possible to obtain the knowledge needed to design the right algorithms to run on our codec chip. Optogenetic stimulaton can now be used to drive neurons in macaque cortex and computer vision can now be used to track freely moving monkeys while recording wirelessly. We propose to leverage these recent advances to dramatically increase prosthetic performance through the principled design of: (1) An entirely new class of encoders that can spatio-temporally pattern neural activity via optogenetic techniques. (2) An entirely new class of decoders that can operate in the real world with animals moving freely around in far less constrained settings. (3) An entirely new class of implantable programmable electronics that achieves the level of energy- efficiency required to run these complex algorithms. We will demonstrate our success by having a freely moving primate, with a 96-microelectrode recording array and a 9-channel optogenetic stimulator implanted in its premotor and somatosensory cortex, respectively, control a human-like robotic arm. Our ultimate goal is to realize the neuromorphic engineer's dream: Helping untold millions with neurological injury by replacing damaged neural tissue with chips that work like the brain. Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decodes these signals in order to execute the intended movement with a robotic arm.

"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synapses between neurons are plastic - able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an ""error signal"" that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers or othe cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circui uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorder, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local ""decisions"" cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit's function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.            ",Instructive Signals for Motor Learning,8964760,R01NS072406,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Part', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Plastics', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory encoding', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'oculomotor', 'optogenetics', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'therapy design', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,473336,0.023453070956173286
"Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements: characterization and DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall project goals are to study the cortical network dynamics of human upper limb motor control spanning two distinct spatial scales recorded with electrocorticography (ECoG), and to demonstrate that these dynamics can be estimated in real-time and used to control the JHU Applied Physics Lab Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) during execution of functionally useful complex action sequences.  Our human subjects will be instructed to perform complete functional movements characteristic of activities of daily living.  We will analyze the task-related temporal evolution in the strength and pattern o interactions among large-scale cortical networks known to be recruited in visually-guided reach-to-grasp tasks.  Using multi-scale subdural ECoG with combinations of routine clinical macro-electrodes (2.3 mm diameter, 1 cm spacing) recording activity of broadly spread elements/nodes of neural networks, and inset arrays of microelectrodes (75 �m diameter, 0.9 mm spacing) recording the activity of local sub-networks, we will test our overall hypothesis that there is a functional hierarchy between the two scales (Aim 1).  More specifically, we hypothesize that large-scale network dynamics involving premotor/motor cortex reflect the evolution of sensory-motor processing demands during complex action sequences, while micro-scale population activity and network dynamics in motor cortex reflect the low-level kinematics of these tasks.  We will utilize methods of estimating dynamic effective connectivity developed by our team to study interactions between these scales and test whether there exists a spatially heterogeneous and hierarchical structure within the macro-micro scale networks.  The results of these analyses have wide-ranging clinical implications for both the optimal scale of functional mapping for clinical diagnostic purposes and the extent of implantations for neuroprosthetic control.  We will exploit multi-scale ECoG recordings and online estimates of the dynamics of neural activation and large-scale/local network interactions to achieve control of the MPL during functionally useful tasks (Aim 2).  This approach will go beyond traditional paradigms that have developed neural control over individual degrees of freedom.  We will do this by embedding low-level control within an innovative framework whereby knowledge of task goals supplement direct kinematic decoding.  This project will build on our team's previous successes in implementing a system for semi-autonomous ECoG control of the MPL, employing machine vision and route-planning algorithms, during complex interactions with objects requiring the coordination of multiple joints.  This system will be able to leverage for the first time the rich complexity of temporally and spatially resolved network dynamics correlated with high-level goals to achieve functionally useful control of an advanced neuroprosthetic limb.

"Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes The overall goal of these experiments is to understand how the brain controls where we look. To accomplish this, it is important to study brain activity and behavior under conditions that closely approximate those in the real world. All of the experiments we propose to do will use awake behaving rhesus monkeys as subjects. In prior work, we have studied activity in the cortical frontal eye field while monkeys looked at images of natural scenes. The frontal eye field (FEF) is closely involved in the control of purposive voluntary eye movements. While the monkey searched for a target hidden in the images of natural scenes, the activity of FEF neurons consisted of combinations of activity related to planning upcoming eye movements, as well as activity that was sensitive to salient visual features of the image. In parallel with the development of our understanding of how the brain controls eye movements, there have been substantial advances in our understanding of the features of natural images that guide both human and monkey eye movements. These behavioral studies are at the advanced level of being able to accurately predict patterns of eye movements. Our goal in this proposal is to take advantage of these advancements in predicting patterns of eye movements in natural environments to help us understand the brain events that are responsible for this behavior. We will focus upon neuron activity in the FEF due to its essential role in the control of voluntary eye movements. The proposal has 3 Aims each focused upon a different factor that is known to guide eye movements under natural conditions. Salience describes how different a small part of a visual scene is from the remainder of the scene based upon stimulus features such as color, contrast, shape, and orientation. Our first aim will define the effects that salience has upon FEF activity. In our second aim, we'll quantify the effects of relevance. Relevance refers to the importance of visual features for the task at hand; for example, if we're looking for a red target, the red items in the image will be more likely to attract our attention and ultimately be the target for an eye movement. Knowing the broad composition of a scene, a quality that is called scene gist, can tell us the places where an object is more likely to be found. For example, if we are looking for a bicycle, we are more likely to search the sidewalks and roadways of a street scene and ignore other places where bicycles are unlikely to be found. Our final aim will look for the effects of scene gist upon monkey behavior and the FEF activity driving that behavior. In addition to the brain recording experiments outlined above, a large part of our effort will be devoted to mathematical analysis and modeling of the behavioral and neuronal data we obtain. Our ultimate goal is to provide a model that predicts the contributions of salience, relevance, and gist to the activity of FEF neurons. The successful model will be a mathematical representation that predicts search-related activity in the FEF for both artificial and real world conditions. Due to the known and expected similarities between monkey and human eye movement systems, these experiments provide a model for the functional organization of frontal eye field cortex in humans. The ability to make appropriate eye movements is a function that can be damaged by a number of diseases, including cerebral stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Schizophrenia. More specifically, deficits in the proper control of fixation during search of complex visual stimuli have been described in patients suffering from simultanagnosia, as well as in individuals with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.",Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes,8822295,R01EY021579,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory area', 'Banana', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bicycling', 'Brain', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye Movements', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Saccades', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'driving behavior', 'expectation', 'frontal eye fields', 'image guided', 'interest', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical model', 'mind control', 'neuromechanism', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'visual motor', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,376478,0.03714605466734696
"A Software Platform for Sensor-based Movement Disorder Recognition     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this SBIR project is to develop a pre-commercial prototype system capable of continuously monitoring involuntary movement disorders from a wide spectrum of neurological conditions. The impact of this innovation will enhance the availability of advanced brain and behavior research tools [PA- 11-134] by providing a continuous means of tracking the presence and severity of movement disorders during normal daily activities. This project will transform our unique movement disorder recognition algorithms into custom software that analyzes movement disorders for specific neurological conditions. The information obtained from body worn sensors will provide an accurate and objective means for assessing the complex and changeable nature of movement disorders. This goal cannot by realized using the current method of self-report questionnaires.  The research strategy for Phase I will establish the merit and feasibility of this effort by developing an Application Generation (AG) software platform using a framework of configurable signal processing modules to generate custom applications for movement disorder analysis (Aim 1). This approach reduces the effort and enhances the flexibility of designing and testing software solutions for these applications. The AG Platform will be developed using C++ software to implement signal processing and machine-learning software modules that operate within a knowledge-based framework that we have previously developed. In Aim 2 we will utilize the AG platform to generate movement disorder analysis software to evaluate a challenging test-case application: freezing-of-gait in Parkinson's disease (PD). The goal is to attain performance metrics for freezing that are comparable to those we have achieved for tremor and dyskinesia in previous efforts.  Phase II will refine the capabilities of the AG platform developed in Phase I. We will augment it with the means to automatically design and train the machine learning algorithms, improve the user-interface, and provide options for viewing and summarizing the results. The improved AG platform will be used to develop customized disorder-analysis software that encompasses the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD (e.g. dystonia, bradykinesia, Parkinsonian gait, tremor, dyskinesia), as well as for other neurological condition, such as Essential Tremor (ET). Firmware will be developed for each custom application to efficiently integrate the analytic software with our existing Trigno wireless sensor data acquisition hardware, which needs to be streamlined for this application. This combined system will be evaluated under research use-case scenarios in Neurology. Phase II will deliver an ambulatory Movement Disorder Monitoring system that not only succeeds in providing state-of-the-art monitoring solutions for PD and Essential Tremor, but has proven technology to develop monitoring solutions for a wide variety of neurological conditions. Future development will transfer this technology to a clinical version of this system.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project is intended to improve the accuracy and reduce the burden of researchers and clinicians when assessing motor outcomes for patients with involuntary movement disorders. The proposed technology will provide a means for evaluating new treatment options, and expedite the delivery of care. The attainment of these goals should increase the effectiveness of research, the time required for these research advancements to reach the consumer, and help control the rising costs of clinical care among the estimated 45 million Americans who have neurological disorders resulting in involuntary movements. The resulting improvements in motor function will ultimately lead to greater independence and productivity for this growing segment of the population.

"Wrist/Grasp Muscle Activity Patterns for EMG-neural Interface Prosthesis Control     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Simultaneous wrist/hand control (where a person simultaneously moves his/her wrist while grasping or  releasing), is essential in activities of daiy living, but cannot be performed by amputees using clinical surface  electromyography (sEMG) based neural interfaces (myoelectric control). Transradial amputees, who make up 40% of major amputations (proximal to the wrist), cite simultaneous control as a necessary element to improve upper-limb prostheses. Our long-term goal is to develop a clinically viable EMG-based neural interface for transradial amputees that is suitable for restoring simultaneous control of prosthetic wrist/hand movements.   One proposed method for intuitive simultaneous wrist/hand prosthesis control uses intramuscular EMG  (imEMG) amplitude estimates from multiple agonist/ antagonist forearm muscle pairs to control physiologically  appropriate degrees of freedom DOFs (e.g. flexor digitorum profundus / extensor digitorum control  grasp/release). Known as 'direct control', this approach does not require burdensome levels of machine  learning algorithm training, as is required for experimental sEMG-based simultaneous control methods.  However, this method assumes independently modulated muscle activation patterns for each DOF - that the activation patterns of muscles controlling a DOF (i.e. finger flexors/extensors for grasp/release) do not change when a second DOF is simultaneously attempted (simultaneous pronation/supination and grasp/release). The biologic foundation of such an assumption has not been explored to date. Little is known of how the central nervous system (CNS) coordinates wrist and extrinsic hand muscle activation when independent of biomechanical effects and joint position feedback. Muscle activation patterns under such conditions are particularly relevant to amputee populations, who lack distal joints. Therefore, the objective of this research is to better understand how the CNS coordinates muscle activation patterns in healthy individuals to produce simultaneous wrist/grasp torques when independent of the biomechanical effects of joint movement. We will then apply this information to develop an imEMG simultaneous myoelectric prosthesis controller.  imEMG patterns will be measured as healthy subjects produce single-DOF and simultaneous multi-DOF (SMD) wrist and/or grasp/release torques in isometric, neutral posture conditions. Multivariate models predicting imEMG activity from measured wrist/grasp torques will be developed and will suggest which DOFs have independently modulated muscle activation patterns. This information will then allow for the development of a 'biologically-inspired' simultaneous controller. DOFs with independently modulated muscle activation patterns will be controlled using direct control, while experimental pattern recognition algorithms currently used for sEMG-based simultaneous control will be used for all other DOFs. We will evaluate the performance of this hybrid controller in healthy subjects both offline and using online functional tests in a virtual environment.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Various current prosthetic arms use the electrical signals produced when muscles contract to control prosthesis movement, but cannot provide simultaneous control of both the wrist and the hand. This study will investigate how the nervous system activates muscles to simultaneously control the wrist and hand in healthy individuals. This information can then be used to provide clinically viable methods of controlling simultaneous wrist and hand movements of prostheses to amputees.                 ",Wrist/Grasp Muscle Activity Patterns for EMG-neural Interface Prosthesis Control,8702940,F31NS083166,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Educational Status', 'Electromyography', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Flexor', 'Forearm', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intramuscular', 'Isometric Exercise', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Myoelectric prosthesis', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Pronation', 'Prosthesis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supination', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Torque', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'base', 'design', 'extensor digitorum', 'grasp', 'improved', 'joint mobilization', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'virtual']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2014,47676,0.060805286076852524
"A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI NeuroEnabling Technologies, Inc. RESEARCH & RELATED Other Project Information 7. PROJECT SUMMARY Of the approximately 10 million people in the US living with paralysis, 15,000 are the result of spinal cord injury each year. The first year of care can range from $322,000-$986,000, with lifetime costs of $1.4-4M for someone injured at 25 years of age. In addition to potentially devastating sensorimotor disturbances, there is a huge financial cost, estimated to be $13.55B in medical care, therapy, and lost productivity nationwide. Until very recently, the recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) was bleak, with little hope of restoring motor function. To address this we have demonstrated that the physiological state of the spinal circuitry of rats and cats can be modulated with epidural stimulation to generate voluntary limb motor function over a range of speeds, loads, and directions, a finding we have extended to humans. Three years post-injury, a motor complete spinal cord injured human subject was implanted with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord. In less than one month after implantation, the subject could stand independently, and after 7 months of daily epidural stimulation and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of epidural stimulation, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of epidural stimulation. We will advance these discoveries with the use of non-invasive stimulation of the lumbosacral cord to improve lower limb function following SCI. Central to this proposal is our discovery of a painless electrical multi-channel (stimulation of multiple parts of the spinal cord) theranostic tool that can be applied to the surface of the skin, termed transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation (TESCS), bypassing the need for a surgically-implanted electrode array. In the first phase of this proposal we will demonstrate proof-of-principle that stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord can assess spared spinal motor function by: 1) Testing responses to transcutaneous electrical stimulation in subjects with spinal cord injury; and 2) defining the operational parameters of electrical stimulation that that are most effective using a machine-learning protocol, and 3) produce a multi-channel commercial prototype. This commercial product will undergo testing similar to the proof-of- principle device. This device will then be tested in subjects with cervicothoracic spinal cord injury and evaluated with a machine-learning protocol. This Phase I proposal will deliver a device that can painlessly and non-invasively aid in the assessment and recovery of SCI by delivering a specific electrical stimulation paradigm to the lumbosacral cord that improves use of the lower limbs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI NeuroEnabling Technologies, Inc. PROJECT NARRATIVE It now seems possible to apply three interventions: transcutaneous stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training, to assess and enable the excitability of spared neural circuits in humans with a thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their legs. This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postura and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI in which epidural stimulation was used. We will build and demonstrate a multi-channel transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation theranostic tool that we propose will allow assessment and enabling of lower limb function following a cervicothoracic spinal cord injury.

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.  This project examines whether signals recorded directly from the human brain (during surgery for epilepsy) could be used to control a robotic hand.

"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We now have demonstrated that the human lumbosacral spinal cord can be neuromodulated with epidural stimulation to enable recovery of standing and volitional control of the lower limbs and return of some autonomic function after complete motor paralysis.  Therefore, our objectives are now to develop the technologies needed to more fully capitalize on this clinical potential and develop home-use technologies to do so.                  ",Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI,8696689,U01EB007615,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bladder Control', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Contusions', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrodes', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Frequencies', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intramuscular', 'Learning', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Sensory', 'Sex Functioning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord transection injury', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Training', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'motor control', 'motor function improvement', 'motor function recovery', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'somatosensory', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2014,1152001,0.09310700945794884
"Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to apply three interventions (epidural stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training) to control the excitability of localized neural circuits in humans with a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their arms and hands.  This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postural and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI.  We will reach critical milestones that will provide the basis for a series of clinical trials for furter defining the efficacy of these interventions.                ",Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI,8690845,U01EB015521,"['Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Bromocriptine', 'Buspirone', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'FDA approved', 'Felis catus', 'Food', 'Forelimb', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knee', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Oral', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Retrieval', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Upper Extremity', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'arm', 'base', 'design', 'human subject', 'improved', 'minimally invasive', 'motor function recovery', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'public health relevance', 'response']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2014,819964,0.0796889592334056
"Quantitative Analysis of PEM for REMBD Identification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder (RBD) refers to a condition in which patients act out their dreams and engage in potentially disruptive, injurious and even dangerous behavior while asleep[1-3]. Clinical reports of RBD have been shown to anticipate the development of neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's Disease by 20 years or more [4-6]. Despite this potential prognostic significance for human disease, the field of Sleep Medicine lacks an accepted computerized approach to quantify muscle activity in sleep. This proposed interdisciplinary research seeks to merge methods of computer engineering based computation with advanced neuroscience to establish a computerized clinical decision support system (CDSS) to detect RBD via measurement and analysis of the phasic electromyographic activity metric (PEM). The sponsor (Bliwise) has provided evidence based on traditional visual analyses from ""expert"" scorers that PEM recorded during sleep is a sensitive indicator a) to differentiate PD patients from controls [7]; b) to distinguish non-PD patients with a history of RBD from controls [8]; and c) to differentiate PD patients with early and late stage disease [9]. These data suggest that computer-aided PEM detection within a user-friendly CDSS will be vital for clinicians to determine prognosis, track disease course, and, possibly, even monitor treatment.           The proposed work is envisioned as a vital and integral component to establish standardized computerized bio-signal processing methods to detect phasic muscle activity in overnight human sleep polysomnograms for the identification and treatment of Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder.

"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

"Fully Implantable and Programmable Spike-based Codecs for Neuroprosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Often the disability is so severe that it is not possible to feed oneself or readily communicate. A new class of medical system termed brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) has emerged from research labs in the past decade and is now poised to dramatically improve these patients' quality of life. BMIs ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decode these electrical impulses in order to determine the intended movement. Initial versions of BMI systems that control a computer cursor are now in FDA Phase-I clinical trials, and numerous agencies are actively engaged in clinical translation (e.g., NIH, DARPA, VA). Creating control signals to enable an amputee to feed himself with a prosthetic (robotic) arm and hand will require decoding signals from thousands of electrodes, rather than the hundred or so signals current systems read, as well as encoding thousands of sensor signals from the arm and hand into thousands of artificial neural signals to be ""written into"" the brain, which has not yet been attempted. The lack of low-power (so that it can be implanted) electronic circuitry needed to run BMIs' encoding and decoding algorithms (termed codecs) is a fundamental barrier to successful clinical translation. The technologies available until now are too power-hungry (digital) or too algorithmically inflexible (analog) to meet the challenge. Recent advances in neuromorphic engineering make it now possible to build a fully implantable and programmable codec chip. This innovative approach combines digital's and analog's best features-programmability and efficiency-while offering far greater robustness than either. Meanwhile recent advances in neuroscience techniques make it now possible to obtain the knowledge needed to design the right algorithms to run on our codec chip. Optogenetic stimulaton can now be used to drive neurons in macaque cortex and computer vision can now be used to track freely moving monkeys while recording wirelessly. We propose to leverage these recent advances to dramatically increase prosthetic performance through the principled design of: (1) An entirely new class of encoders that can spatio-temporally pattern neural activity via optogenetic techniques. (2) An entirely new class of decoders that can operate in the real world with animals moving freely around in far less constrained settings. (3) An entirely new class of implantable programmable electronics that achieves the level of energy- efficiency required to run these complex algorithms. We will demonstrate our success by having a freely moving primate, with a 96-microelectrode recording array and a 9-channel optogenetic stimulator implanted in its premotor and somatosensory cortex, respectively, control a human-like robotic arm. Our ultimate goal is to realize the neuromorphic engineer's dream: Helping untold millions with neurological injury by replacing damaged neural tissue with chips that work like the brain.           Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment.

"Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements: characterization and DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall project goals are to study the cortical network dynamics of human upper limb motor control spanning two distinct spatial scales recorded with electrocorticography (ECoG), and to demonstrate that these dynamics can be estimated in real-time and used to control the JHU Applied Physics Lab Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) during execution of functionally useful complex action sequences. Our human subjects will be instructed to perform complete functional movements characteristic of activities of daily living. We will analyze the task-related temporal evolution in the strength and pattern o interactions among large-scale cortical networks known to be recruited in visually-guided reach-to-grasp tasks. Using multi-scale subdural ECoG with combinations of routine clinical macro-electrodes (2.3 mm diameter, 1 cm spacing) recording activity of broadly spread elements/nodes of neural networks, and inset arrays of microelectrodes (75 μm diameter, 0.9 mm spacing) recording the activity of local sub-networks, we will test our overall hypothesis that there is a functional hierarchy between the two scales (Aim 1). More specifically, we hypothesize that large-scale network dynamics involving premotor/motor cortex reflect the evolution of sensory-motor processing demands during complex action sequences, while micro-scale population activity and network dynamics in motor cortex reflect the low-level kinematics of these tasks. We will utilize methods of estimating dynamic effective connectivity developed by our team to study interactions between these scales and test whether there exists a spatially heterogeneous and hierarchical structure within the macro-micro scale networks. The results of these analyses have wide-ranging clinical implications for both the optimal scale of functional mapping for clinical diagnostic purposes and the extent of implantations for neuroprosthetic control. We will exploit multi-scale ECoG recordings and online estimates of the dynamics of neural activation and large-scale/local network interactions to achieve control of the MPL during functionally useful tasks (Aim 2). This approach will go beyond traditional paradigms that have developed neural control over individual degrees of freedom. We will do this by embedding low-level control within an innovative framework whereby knowledge of task goals supplement direct kinematic decoding. This project will build on our team's previous successes in implementing a system for semi-autonomous ECoG control of the MPL, employing machine vision and route-planning algorithms, during complex interactions with objects requiring the coordination of multiple joints. This system will be able to leverage for the first time the rich complexity of temporally and spatially resolved network dynamics correlated with high-level goals to achieve functionally useful control of an advanced neuroprosthetic limb.

"Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes  The overall goal of these experiments is to understand how the brain controls where we look. To accomplish this, it is important to study brain activity and behavior under conditions that closely approximate those in the real world. All of the experiments we propose to do will use awake behaving rhesus monkeys as subjects. In prior work, we have studied activity in the cortical frontal eye field while monkeys looked at images of natural scenes. The frontal eye field (FEF) is closely involved in the control of purposive voluntary eye movements. While the monkey searched for a target hidden in the images of natural scenes, the activity of FEF neurons consisted of combinations of activity related to planning upcoming eye movements, as well as activity that was sensitive to salient visual features of the image. In parallel with the development of our understanding of how the brain controls eye movements, there have been substantial advances in our understanding of the features of natural images that guide both human and monkey eye movements. These behavioral studies are at the advanced level of being able to accurately predict patterns of eye movements. Our goal in this proposal is to take advantage of these advancements in predicting patterns of eye movements in natural environments to help us understand the brain events that are responsible for this behavior. We will focus upon neuron activity in the FEF due to its essential role in the control of voluntary eye movements. The proposal has 3 Aims each focused upon a different factor that is known to guide eye movements under natural conditions. Salience describes how different a small part of a visual scene is from the remainder of the scene based upon stimulus features such as color, contrast, shape, and orientation. Our first aim will define the effects that salience has upon FEF activity. In our second aim, we'll quantify the effects of relevance. Relevance refers to the importance of visual features for the task at hand; for example, if we're looking for a red target, the red items in the image will be more likely to attract our attention and ultimately be the target for an eye movement. Knowing the broad composition of a scene, a quality that is called scene gist, can tell us the places where an object is more likely to be found. For example, if we are looking for a bicycle, we are more likely to search the sidewalks and roadways of a street scene and ignore other places where bicycles are unlikely to be found. Our final aim will look for the effects of scene gist upon monkey behavior and the FEF activity driving that behavior. In addition to the brain recording experiments outlined above, a large part of our effort will be devoted to mathematical analysis and modeling of the behavioral and neuronal data we obtain. Our ultimate goal is to provide a model that predicts the contributions of salience, relevance, and gist to the activity of FEF neurons. The successful model will be a mathematical representation that predicts search-related activity in the FEF for both artificial and real world conditions.  Due to the known and expected similarities between monkey and human eye movement systems, these experiments provide a model for the functional organization of frontal eye field cortex in humans. The ability to make appropriate eye movements is a function that can be damaged by a number of diseases, including cerebral stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Schizophrenia. More specifically, deficits in the proper control of fixation during search of complex visual stimuli have been described in patients suffering from simultanagnosia, as well as in individuals with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.",Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes,8634100,R01EY021579,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory area', 'Banana', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bicycling', 'Brain', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye Movements', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Saccades', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'awake', 'base', 'driving behavior', 'expectation', 'frontal eye fields', 'interest', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical model', 'mind control', 'neuromechanism', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'visual motor', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,376478,0.03714605466734696
"CRCNS: Hybrid non-invasive brain-machine interfaces for 3D object manipulation Interacting with the physical environment and manipulating objects is an essential part of daily life. This ability is lost in upper-limb amputees as well as patients with spinal cord injury, stroke, ALS and other movement disorders. These people know what they want to do as well as how they would do it if their arms were functional. If such knowledge is decoded and sent to a prosthetic arm (or to the patient's own arm fitted with functional electric stimulators) the lost motor function could be restored. The decoding is unlikely to be perfect however the brain can adapt to an imperfect decoder using real-time feedback. Several groups including ours have recently demonstrated that at least in principle this can be achieved. However, as is often the case in science, the initial work has been done in idealized conditions and its applicability to real-world usage scenarios remains an open question. The goal of this project is to bring movement control brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) closer to helping the people who need them, and at the same time exploit the rich datasets we collect in order to advance our understanding of sensorimotor control and learning. This will be accomplished by creating hybrid BMIs which exploit information from multiple sources, combined with modern algorithms from machine learning and automatic control.

"A Software Platform for Sensor-based Movement Disorder Recognition     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this SBIR project is to develop a pre-commercial prototype system capable of continuously monitoring involuntary movement disorders from a wide spectrum of neurological conditions. The impact of this innovation will enhance the availability of advanced brain and behavior research tools [PA- 11-134] by providing a continuous means of tracking the presence and severity of movement disorders during normal daily activities. This project will transform our unique movement disorder recognition algorithms into custom software that analyzes movement disorders for specific neurological conditions. The information obtained from body worn sensors will provide an accurate and objective means for assessing the complex and changeable nature of movement disorders. This goal cannot by realized using the current method of self-report questionnaires.  The research strategy for Phase I will establish the merit and feasibility of this effort by developing an Application Generation (AG) software platform using a framework of configurable signal processing modules to generate custom applications for movement disorder analysis (Aim 1). This approach reduces the effort and enhances the flexibility of designing and testing software solutions for these applications. The AG Platform will be developed using C++ software to implement signal processing and machine-learning software modules that operate within a knowledge-based framework that we have previously developed. In Aim 2 we will utilize the AG platform to generate movement disorder analysis software to evaluate a challenging test-case application: freezing-of-gait in Parkinson's disease (PD). The goal is to attain performance metrics for freezing that are comparable to those we have achieved for tremor and dyskinesia in previous efforts.  Phase II will refine the capabilities of the AG platform developed in Phase I. We will augment it with the means to automatically design and train the machine learning algorithms, improve the user-interface, and provide options for viewing and summarizing the results. The improved AG platform will be used to develop customized disorder-analysis software that encompasses the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD (e.g. dystonia, bradykinesia, Parkinsonian gait, tremor, dyskinesia), as well as for other neurological condition, such as Essential Tremor (ET). Firmware will be developed for each custom application to efficiently integrate the analytic software with our existing Trigno wireless sensor data acquisition hardware, which needs to be streamlined for this application. This combined system will be evaluated under research use-case scenarios in Neurology. Phase II will deliver an ambulatory Movement Disorder Monitoring system that not only succeeds in providing state-of-the-art monitoring solutions for PD and Essential Tremor, but has proven technology to develop monitoring solutions for a wide variety of neurological conditions. Future development will transfer this technology to a clinical version of this system.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project is intended to improve the accuracy and reduce the burden of researchers and clinicians when assessing motor outcomes for patients with involuntary movement disorders. The proposed technology will provide a means for evaluating new treatment options, and expedite the delivery of care. The attainment of these goals should increase the effectiveness of research, the time required for these research advancements to reach the consumer, and help control the rising costs of clinical care among the estimated 45 million Americans who have neurological disorders resulting in involuntary movements.

"Restoring arm and hand motor function with non-invasive spinal stimulation.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Of the approximately 10 million people in the US living with paralysis, 15,000 are the result of spinal cord injury each year. The first year of car can range from $322,000-$986,000, with lifetime costs of $1.4-4M for someone injured at 25 years of age. In addition to potentially devastating sensorimotor disturbances, there is a huge financial cost, estimated to be $13.55B in medical care, therapy, and lost productivity nationwide. Until very recently, the recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) was bleak, with little hope of restoring motor function. To address this we have demonstrated that the physiological state of the spinal circuitry of rats and cats can be modulated with epidural stimulation to generate voluntary limb motor function over a range of speeds, loads, and directions, a finding we have extended to humans. Three years post-injury, a motor complete spinal cord injured human subject was implanted with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord. In less than one month after implantation, the subject could stand independently, and after 7 months of daily epidural stimulation and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of epidural stimulation, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of epidural stimulation. We will advance these discoveries with the use of non-invasive stimulation of the cervical cord to improve arm and hand function following SCI. Central to this proposal is our discovery of a painless electrical single-channel (stimulation of one part of the spinal cord) and dual-channel (stimulation of two different parts of the cord) paradigm that can be applied to the surface of the skin, termed transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES), bypassing the need for a surgically-implanted electrode array. In the first phase of this proposal we will demonstrate proof-of-principle that stimulation of the cervical spinal cord can improve motor function by: 1) Testing responses to transcutaneous electrical stimulation in subjects with spinal cord injury; and 2) defining the operational parameters of electrical stimulation that that are most effective using a machine-learning protocol, and 3) produce a dual-channel commercial prototype. This commercial product will undergo testing similar to the proof- of-principle device. This device will then be tested in subjects with cervical spinal cord injury and evaluated with a machine-learning protocol. This Phase I proposal will deliver a device that can painlessly and non-invasively aid in the recovery of SCI by delivering a specific electrical stimulation paradigm to the cervical cord that improves use of the arms and hands.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Electrical modulation of the spinal cord can restore voluntary motor function in patients with spinal cord injury, a phenomenon we have demonstrated with both implantable electric devices and devices that provide electrical stimulation to the cord through the surface of the skin.

"Wrist/Grasp Muscle Activity Patterns for EMG-neural Interface Prosthesis Control     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Simultaneous wrist/hand control (where a person simultaneously moves his/her wrist while grasping or  releasing), is essential in activities of daiy living, but cannot be performed by amputees using clinical surface  electromyography (sEMG) based neural interfaces (myoelectric control). Transradial amputees, who make up 40% of major amputations (proximal to the wrist), cite simultaneous control as a necessary element to improve upper-limb prostheses. Our long-term goal is to develop a clinically viable EMG-based neural interface for transradial amputees that is suitable for restoring simultaneous control of prosthetic wrist/hand movements.   One proposed method for intuitive simultaneous wrist/hand prosthesis control uses intramuscular EMG  (imEMG) amplitude estimates from multiple agonist/ antagonist forearm muscle pairs to control physiologically  appropriate degrees of freedom DOFs (e.g. flexor digitorum profundus / extensor digitorum control  grasp/release). Known as 'direct control', this approach does not require burdensome levels of machine  learning algorithm training, as is required for experimental sEMG-based simultaneous control methods.  However, this method assumes independently modulated muscle activation patterns for each DOF - that the activation patterns of muscles controlling a DOF (i.e. finger flexors/extensors for grasp/release) do not change when a second DOF is simultaneously attempted (simultaneous pronation/supination and grasp/release). The biologic foundation of such an assumption has not been explored to date. Little is known of how the central nervous system (CNS) coordinates wrist and extrinsic hand muscle activation when independent of biomechanical effects and joint position feedback. Muscle activation patterns under such conditions are particularly relevant to amputee populations, who lack distal joints. Therefore, the objective of this research is to better understand how the CNS coordinates muscle activation patterns in healthy individuals to produce simultaneous wrist/grasp torques when independent of the biomechanical effects of joint movement. We will then apply this information to develop an imEMG simultaneous myoelectric prosthesis controller.  imEMG patterns will be measured as healthy subjects produce single-DOF and simultaneous multi-DOF (SMD) wrist and/or grasp/release torques in isometric, neutral posture conditions. Multivariate models predicting imEMG activity from measured wrist/grasp torques will be developed and will suggest which DOFs have independently modulated muscle activation patterns. This information will then allow for the development of a 'biologically-inspired' simultaneous controller. DOFs with independently modulated muscle activation patterns will be controlled using direct control, while experimental pattern recognition algorithms currently used for sEMG-based simultaneous control will be used for all other DOFs. We will evaluate the performance of this hybrid controller in healthy subjects both offline and using online functional tests in a virtual environment.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Various current prosthetic arms use the electrical signals produced when muscles contract to control prosthesis movement, but cannot provide simultaneous control of both the wrist and the hand. This study will investigate how the nervous system activates muscles to simultaneously control the wrist and hand in healthy individuals. This information can then be used to provide clinically viable methods of controlling simultaneous wrist and hand movements of prostheses to amputees.                 ",Wrist/Grasp Muscle Activity Patterns for EMG-neural Interface Prosthesis Control,8526724,F31NS083166,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Educational Status', 'Electromyography', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Flexor', 'Forearm', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intramuscular', 'Isometric Exercise', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Myoelectric prosthesis', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Pronation', 'Prosthesis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supination', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Torque', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'base', 'design', 'extensor digitorum', 'grasp', 'improved', 'joint mobilization', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'virtual']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2013,47232,0.060805286076852524

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.

"Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to apply three interventions (epidural stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training) to control the excitability of localized neural circuits in humans with a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their arms and hands.  This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postural and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI.  We will reach critical milestones that will provide the basis for a series of clinical trials for furter defining the efficacy of these interventions.                ",Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI,8507061,U01EB015521,"['Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Bromocriptine', 'Buspirone', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'FDA approved', 'Felis catus', 'Food', 'Forelimb', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knee', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Oral', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Retrieval', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Upper Extremity', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'arm', 'base', 'design', 'human subject', 'improved', 'minimally invasive', 'motor function recovery', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'public health relevance', 'response']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2013,863301,0.0796889592334056
"Quantitative Analysis of PEM for REMBD Identification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder (RBD) refers to a condition in which patients act out their dreams and engage in potentially disruptive, injurious and even dangerous behavior while asleep[1-3]. Clinical reports of RBD have been shown to anticipate the development of neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's Disease by 20 years or more [4-6]. Despite this potential prognostic significance for human disease, the field of Sleep Medicine lacks an accepted computerized approach to quantify muscle activity in sleep. This proposed interdisciplinary research seeks to merge methods of computer engineering based computation with advanced neuroscience to establish a computerized clinical decision support system (CDSS) to detect RBD via measurement and analysis of the phasic electromyographic activity metric (PEM). The sponsor (Bliwise) has provided evidence based on traditional visual analyses from ""expert"" scorers that PEM recorded during sleep is a sensitive indicator a) to differentiate PD patients from controls [7]; b) to distinguish non-PD patients with a history of RBD from controls [8]; and c) to differentiate PD patients with early and late stage disease [9]. These data suggest that computer-aided PEM detection within a user-friendly CDSS will be vital for clinicians to determine prognosis, track disease course, and, possibly, even monitor treatment.           The proposed work is envisioned as a vital and integral component to establish standardized computerized bio-signal processing methods to detect phasic muscle activity in overnight human sleep polysomnograms for the identification and treatment of Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder.

"Fully Implantable and Programmable Spike-based Codecs for Neuroprosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Often the disability is so severe that it is not possible to feed oneself or readily communicate. A new class of medical system termed brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) has emerged from research labs in the past decade and is now poised to dramatically improve these patients' quality of life. BMIs ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decode these electrical impulses in order to determine the intended movement. Initial versions of BMI systems that control a computer cursor are now in FDA Phase-I clinical trials, and numerous agencies are actively engaged in clinical translation (e.g., NIH, DARPA, VA). Creating control signals to enable an amputee to feed himself with a prosthetic (robotic) arm and hand will require decoding signals from thousands of electrodes, rather than the hundred or so signals current systems read, as well as encoding thousands of sensor signals from the arm and hand into thousands of artificial neural signals to be ""written into"" the brain, which has not yet been attempted. The lack of low-power (so that it can be implanted) electronic circuitry needed to run BMIs' encoding and decoding algorithms (termed codecs) is a fundamental barrier to successful clinical translation. The technologies available until now are too power-hungry (digital) or too algorithmically inflexible (analog) to meet the challenge. Recent advances in neuromorphic engineering make it now possible to build a fully implantable and programmable codec chip. This innovative approach combines digital's and analog's best features-programmability and efficiency-while offering far greater robustness than either. Meanwhile recent advances in neuroscience techniques make it now possible to obtain the knowledge needed to design the right algorithms to run on our codec chip. Optogenetic stimulaton can now be used to drive neurons in macaque cortex and computer vision can now be used to track freely moving monkeys while recording wirelessly. We propose to leverage these recent advances to dramatically increase prosthetic performance through the principled design of: (1) An entirely new class of encoders that can spatio-temporally pattern neural activity via optogenetic techniques. (2) An entirely new class of decoders that can operate in the real world with animals moving freely around in far less constrained settings. (3) An entirely new class of implantable programmable electronics that achieves the level of energy- efficiency required to run these complex algorithms. We will demonstrate our success by having a freely moving primate, with a 96-microelectrode recording array and a 9-channel optogenetic stimulator implanted in its premotor and somatosensory cortex, respectively, control a human-like robotic arm. Our ultimate goal is to realize the neuromorphic engineer's dream: Helping untold millions with neurological injury by replacing damaged neural tissue with chips that work like the brain.

"Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes  The overall goal of these experiments is to understand how the brain controls where we look. To accomplish this, it is important to study brain activity and behavior under conditions that closely approximate those in the real world. All of the experiments we propose to do will use awake behaving rhesus monkeys as subjects. In prior work, we have studied activity in the cortical frontal eye field while monkeys looked at images of natural scenes. The frontal eye field (FEF) is closely involved in the control of purposive voluntary eye movements. While the monkey searched for a target hidden in the images of natural scenes, the activity of FEF neurons consisted of combinations of activity related to planning upcoming eye movements, as well as activity that was sensitive to salient visual features of the image. In parallel with the development of our understanding of how the brain controls eye movements, there have been substantial advances in our understanding of the features of natural images that guide both human and monkey eye movements. These behavioral studies are at the advanced level of being able to accurately predict patterns of eye movements. Our goal in this proposal is to take advantage of these advancements in predicting patterns of eye movements in natural environments to help us understand the brain events that are responsible for this behavior. We will focus upon neuron activity in the FEF due to its essential role in the control of voluntary eye movements. The proposal has 3 Aims each focused upon a different factor that is known to guide eye movements under natural conditions. Salience describes how different a small part of a visual scene is from the remainder of the scene based upon stimulus features such as color, contrast, shape, and orientation. Our first aim will define the effects that salience has upon FEF activity. In our second aim, we'll quantify the effects of relevance. Relevance refers to the importance of visual features for the task at hand; for example, if we're looking for a red target, the red items in the image will be more likely to attract our attention and ultimately be the target for an eye movement. Knowing the broad composition of a scene, a quality that is called scene gist, can tell us the places where an object is more likely to be found. For example, if we are looking for a bicycle, we are more likely to search the sidewalks and roadways of a street scene and ignore other places where bicycles are unlikely to be found. Our final aim will look for the effects of scene gist upon monkey behavior and the FEF activity driving that behavior. In addition to the brain recording experiments outlined above, a large part of our effort will be devoted to mathematical analysis and modeling of the behavioral and neuronal data we obtain. Our ultimate goal is to provide a model that predicts the contributions of salience, relevance, and gist to the activity of FEF neurons. The successful model will be a mathematical representation that predicts search-related activity in the FEF for both artificial and real world conditions.  Due to the known and expected similarities between monkey and human eye movement systems, these experiments provide a model for the functional organization of frontal eye field cortex in humans. The ability to make appropriate eye movements is a function that can be damaged by a number of diseases, including cerebral stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Schizophrenia. More specifically, deficits in the proper control of fixation during search of complex visual stimuli have been described in patients suffering from simultanagnosia, as well as in individuals with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.",Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes,8451290,R01EY021579,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory area', 'Banana', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Bicycling', 'Brain', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye Movements', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Saccades', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'awake', 'base', 'driving behavior', 'expectation', 'frontal eye fields', 'interest', 'mind control', 'neuromechanism', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'visual motor', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,364955,0.03714605466734696
"CRCNS: Hybrid non-invasive brain-machine interfaces for 3D object manipulation Interacting with the physical environment and manipulating objects is an essential part of daily life. This ability is lost in upper-limb amputees as well as patients with spinal cord injury, stroke, ALS and other movement disorders. These people know what they want to do as well as how they would do it if their arms were functional. If such knowledge is decoded and sent to a prosthetic arm (or to the patient's own arm fitted with functional electric stimulators) the lost motor function could be restored. The decoding is unlikely to be perfect however the brain can adapt to an imperfect decoder using real-time feedback. Several groups including ours have recently demonstrated that at least in principle this can be achieved. However, as is often the case in science, the initial work has been done in idealized conditions and its applicability to real-world usage scenarios remains an open question. The goal of this project is to bring movement control brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) closer to helping the people who need them, and at the same time exploit the rich datasets we collect in order to advance our understanding of sensorimotor control and learning. This will be accomplished by creating hybrid BMIs which exploit information from multiple sources, combined with modern algorithms from machine learning and automatic control.

"Toward an Animal Model of Freely Moving Humans PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Our overarching goal is to establish an animal model of freely moving humans. We choose to do so in order to directly measure the context-dependency of motor cortical activity and, ultimately, other activity reliant upon free movement such as social interaction among animals. Achieving this major technological challenge requires  a complete system that includes (Specific Aim 1) wireless transmission of neural data from electrode arrays chronically implanted in monkeys, (Specific Aim 2) computer-vision algorithms to automatically extract body and limb orientation during free movement, and (Specific Aim 3) new mathematical and computational models  to represent and extract information from high-dimensional neural and behavioral activity. This technology will enable an animal model of freely moving humans that will advance the development of cortical neural prostheses by providing models of the context-dependant nature of motor cortical control.   Unlike traditional laboratory environments used to study animal movement, human amputees and tetraplegics operate in a variety of contexts that involve their movement in the world. Understanding the motor control of complex movement in these natural settings is absolutely critical for future advances in cortically-controlled prostheses. Given our overarching goal, our hypothesis is that motor cortical activity (e.g.,  directional tuning curves, absolute firing rates, correlations among units, etc.) will be different in important ways when rhesus monkeys perform the same reaching arm movements in an un-constrained context (e.g., not sitting quietly, not head restrained, not in dark and quiet room, etc.) as in a traditional, highly constrained context. Our three Specific Aims will put in place the electronic, computational and mathematical technology  necessary to address this hypothesis, and also to make such studies of free behavior in rhesus monkeys possible.  The innovative integration of neural engineering, neuroscience, computer vision, mathematics and neural modeling will provide new tools to enable the unprecedented study of motor control during natural, unconstrained behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research project is directly relevant to both basic neuroscience studies of higher brain function and to neural prosthesis research aimed at, ultimately, helping patients with motor disorders. We will conduct neurophysiological and behavioral experiments with rhesus monkeys in two different contexts - ""in home cage""  and ""in rig"" - to investigate the context dependence of motor cortical activity. With this knowledge, we will then design ""context independent"" models of the neural-behavioral relationship which we, and other researchers, could then use in neural prosthetic experiments while monkeys freely move around their less-constrained home cages.",Toward an Animal Model of Freely Moving Humans,8290387,R01NS066311,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Amputees', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Limb structure', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Robotics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Technology', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Wireless Technology', 'arm', 'computer science', 'design', 'free behavior', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'neural model', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'skills', 'tool', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,227048,0.07322125572342594
"Perceptual Learning: Human vs. Optimal Bayesian Neural plasticity and perceptual learning are fundamental in the developmental stages of vision,  in attaining expertise in specialized perceptual tasks, and in recovery from brain injuries and low-  vision disorders. One important process in perceptual learning is the improvement in humans'  ability to use task-relevant (signal) information. Although there have been advances in the  understanding of the dynamics and algorithms mediating how humans optimize the selection of  task relevant visual information, little is known about how eye movement patterns vary with  practice and their impact in optimizing perceptual performance. Yet, in real world environments,  eye movements are a critical component of active vision as humans explore the visual scene to  make perceptual judgments. Understanding perceptual learning in human daily life requires  studying the mechanisms mediating the changes in the planning of eye movements with learning  and their contributions to optimizing perceptual performance. We hypothesize that two new  experimental paradigms with digitally designed visual stimuli, in conjunction with eye position  recording, and a newly developed foveated ideal observer and Bayesian learner will help  elucidate how humans learn to strategize their eye movements and the contributions of the  optimized sampling of the images to improvements in perceptual learning. The proposed work  will address the following questions: 1) Do humans use learned information about the statistical  properties of the visual stimuli and the requirements of the task at hand to strategize their eye  movements to optimize the foveal sampling of the visual scene and perceptual performance?; 2)  Do humans use knowledge of the varying resolution of their foveated visual system to optimally  learn to plan eye movements for a given set of visual stimuli and task?; 3) What are the  contributions of learning to strategize eye movements to the overall improvements in perceptual  performance in ecologically important tasks such as face recognition, object identification and  visual search?; 4) How do human fixation patterns and performance benefits from strategizing  eye movements compare to an optimal foveated observer and learner? The proposed work will  improve our understanding of the human neural algorithms mediating the dynamics of adult  perceptual learning during active vision for ecologically important tasks. The proposed  experimental protocols and theoretical developments will also provide a novel, powerful and  flexible framework with which other researchers can study eye movements and learning of  humans undergoing visual loss recovery as well as patients with learning disabilities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  The proposed work benefits public health by increasing our understanding of how  humans learn to move their eyes to potentially informative regions of the visual scene in  important daily tasks such as identifying faces or searching for objects. Thorough  understanding of these mechanisms in normal humans will allow identification of  learning anomalies in patients recovering from visual-loss or learning disabilities and  potentially develop tests to assess treatments.",Perceptual Learning: Human vs. Optimal Bayesian,8323947,R01EY015925,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Amblyopia', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Blindness', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Chin', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nose', 'Oral cavity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual learning', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Retinitis Pigmentosa', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Testing', 'To specify', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'Vision Disorders', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'active vision', 'area striata', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'gaze', 'ideal observer (Bayesian)', 'improved', 'interest', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'oculomotor', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'tumor', 'visual information', 'visual performance', 'visual process', 'visual processing', 'visual search', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2012,281126,0.021231116924900408
"Fully Implantable and Programmable Spike-based Codecs for Neuroprosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Often the disability is so severe that it is not possible to feed oneself or readily communicate. A new class of medical system termed brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) has emerged from research labs in the past decade and is now poised to dramatically improve these patients' quality of life. BMIs ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decode these electrical impulses in order to determine the intended movement. Initial versions of BMI systems that control a computer cursor are now in FDA Phase-I clinical trials, and numerous agencies are actively engaged in clinical translation (e.g., NIH, DARPA, VA). Creating control signals to enable an amputee to feed himself with a prosthetic (robotic) arm and hand will require decoding signals from thousands of electrodes, rather than the hundred or so signals current systems read, as well as encoding thousands of sensor signals from the arm and hand into thousands of artificial neural signals to be ""written into"" the brain, which has not yet been attempted. The lack of low-power (so that it can be implanted) electronic circuitry needed to run BMIs' encoding and decoding algorithms (termed codecs) is a fundamental barrier to successful clinical translation. The technologies available until now are too power-hungry (digital) or too algorithmically inflexible (analog) to meet the challenge. Recent advances in neuromorphic engineering make it now possible to build a fully implantable and programmable codec chip. This innovative approach combines digital's and analog's best features-programmability and efficiency-while offering far greater robustness than either. Meanwhile recent advances in neuroscience techniques make it now possible to obtain the knowledge needed to design the right algorithms to run on our codec chip. Optogenetic stimulaton can now be used to drive neurons in macaque cortex and computer vision can now be used to track freely moving monkeys while recording wirelessly. We propose to leverage these recent advances to dramatically increase prosthetic performance through the principled design of: (1) An entirely new class of encoders that can spatio-temporally pattern neural activity via optogenetic techniques. (2) An entirely new class of decoders that can operate in the real world with animals moving freely around in far less constrained settings. (3) An entirely new class of implantable programmable electronics that achieves the level of energy- efficiency required to run these complex algorithms. We will demonstrate our success by having a freely moving primate, with a 96-microelectrode recording array and a 9-channel optogenetic stimulator implanted in its premotor and somatosensory cortex, respectively, control a human-like robotic arm. Our ultimate goal is to realize the neuromorphic engineer's dream: Helping untold millions with neurological injury by replacing damaged neural tissue with chips that work like the brain.           Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decodes these signals in order to execute the intended movement with a robotic arm.

"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array to Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load- bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with pharmacological and motor training interventions.  Within the first 2.5 years of the present BRP Grant, not within the five years as initially proposed, we have gathered sufficient data to demonstrate that the human lumbosacral spinal cord has similar capabilities.  We have shown that an individual with a motor complete spinal cord injury can regain independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation after months of testing different spinal cord stimulation patterns and motor training.  Just as important and as impressive is the recovery of significant levels of bladder control, blood pressure, and temperature regulation, and even sexual function in this patient (13a).  These intriguing results compel us to begin additional efforts to overcome what are now recognized as the most critical factors limiting our progress toward making this intervention available in the clinic.  Based on our results, it is clear that we can develop the capability to selectively activae combinations of neural networks that can enable standing and probably stepping with improved technology in humans with a functionally motor complete spinal cord injury.  These functional improvements are even more likely to benefit those individuals that are functionally motor incomplete, but have severely impaired mobility.  Our present accomplishments have been realized using technology that is three decades old and initially designed for a different purpose, i.e., pain management.  Thus we are requesting funds to overcome the present technical, not physiological, limitations as expediently and as carefully as possible.  More specifically, the rat limiting factors are the lack of technology for chronic implants for a high number of electrodes and the need for a more clear understanding of how these epidural stimulation arrays can modulate the spinal circuitries.  To overcome these factors we need to 1) develop a device that will allow us to chronically implant an integrated electrode array and multiplexed stimulation device in rats with the necessary signal control capabilities, 2) evaluate hypotheses that will guide us to more clearly understand how to modulate the stimulation parameters to activate the desired spinal circuits, 3) develop a learning strategy to automatically optimize the stimulation parameters for a given patient to stand, step, or exert voluntary control, and 4) begin to explore the pathways through which voluntary control can be regained after a severe spinal cord injury.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to develop a technology that will enable the recovery of postural and locomotor function in humans after a motor complete spinal cord injury.  This technology includes the capability to stimulate the lower spinal cord in a manner that can enable a patient with complete paraplegia to stand and to step.  This project outlines the newly recognized technical capabilities that must be developed to accomplish this goal.                   It now seems possible to develop a technology that will enable the recovery of postural and locomotor function in humans after a motor complete spinal cord injury.

"Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of these experiments is to understand how the brain controls where we look. To accomplish this, it is important to study brain activity and behavior under conditions that closely approximate those in the real world. All of the experiments we propose to do will use awake behaving rhesus monkeys as subjects. In prior work, we have studied activity in the cortical frontal eye field while monkeys looked at images of natural scenes. The frontal eye field (FEF) is closely involved in the control of purposive voluntary eye movements. While the monkey searched for a target hidden in the images of natural scenes, the activity of FEF neurons consisted of combinations of activity related to planning upcoming eye movements, as well as activity that was sensitive to salient visual features of the image. In parallel with the development of our understanding of how the brain controls eye movements, there have been substantial advances in our understanding of the features of natural images that guide both human and monkey eye movements. These behavioral studies are at the advanced level of being able to accurately predict patterns of eye movements. Our goal in this proposal is to take advantage of these advancements in predicting patterns of eye movements in natural environments to help us understand the brain events that are responsible for this behavior. We will focus upon neuron activity in the FEF due to its essential role in the control of voluntary eye movements. The proposal has 3 Aims each focused upon a different factor that is known to guide eye movements under natural conditions. Salience describes how different a small part of a visual scene is from the remainder of the scene based upon stimulus features such as color, contrast, shape, and orientation. Our first aim will define the effects that salience has upon FEF activity. In our second aim, we'll quantify the effects of relevance. Relevance refers to the importance of visual features for the task at hand; for example, if we're looking for a red target, the red items in the image will be more likely to attrat our attention and ultimately be the target for an eye movement. Knowing the broad composition of a scene, a quality that is called scene gist, can tell us the places where an object is more likely to be found. For example, if we are looking for a bicycle, we are more likely to search the sidewalks and roadways of a street scene and ignore other places where bicycles are unlikely to be found. Our final aim will look for the effects of scene gist upon monkey behavior and the FEF activity driving that behavior. In addition to the brain recording experiments outlined above, a large part of our effort will be devoted to mathematical analysis and modeling of the behavioral and neuronal data we obtain. Our ultimate goal is to provide a model that predicts the contributions of salience, relevance, and gist to the activity of FEF neurons. The successful model will be a mathematical representation that predicts search-related activity in the FEF for both artificial and real world conditions.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Due to the known and expected similarities between monkey and human eye movement systems, these experiments provide a model for the functional organization of frontal eye field cortex in humans. The ability to make appropriate eye movements is a function that can be damaged by a number of diseases, including cerebral stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Schizophrenia. More specifically, deficits in the proper control of fixation during search of complex visual stimuli have been described in patients suffering from simultanagnosia, as well as in individuals with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.                  Due to the known and expected similarities between monkey and human eye movement systems, these experiments provide a model for the functional organization of frontal eye field cortex in humans.

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.

"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal. The new technology will be tested in two applied studies that will be carried out concurrently with the technical developments. One will investigate neural modifications in the firing characteristics of motor units as a function of aging and physical activity. The other will investigate the mitigating effects of resistive exercise on age-related neural adaptations, culminating in the development of a clinical marker to estimate the likelihood that an elderly individual will benefit from an exercise program.

"Toward an Animal Model of Freely Moving Humans Our overarching goal is to establish an animal model of freely moving humans. We choose to do so in order to directly measure the context-dependency of motor cortical activity and, ultimately, other activity reliant upon free movement such as social interaction among animals. Achieving this major technological challenge requires a complete system that includes (Specific Aim 1) wireless transmission of neural data from electrode arrays chronically implanted in monkeys, (Specific Aim 2) computer-vision algorithms to automatically extract body and limb orientation during free movement, and (Specific Aim 3) new mathematical and computational models to represent and extract information from high-dimensional neural and behavioral activity. This technology will enable an animal model of freely moving humans that will advance the development of cortical neural prostheses by providing models of the context-dependant nature of motor cortical control.  Unlike traditional laboratory environments used to study animal movement, human amputees and tetraplegics operate in a variety of contexts that involve their movement in the world. Understanding the motor control of complex movement in these natural settings is absolutely critical for future advances in cortically- controlled prostheses. Given our overarching goal, our hypothesis is that motor cortical activity (e.g., directional tuning curves, absolute firing rates, correlations among units, etc.) will be different in important ways when rhesus monkeys perform the same reaching arm movements in an un-constrained context (e.g., not sitting quietly, not head restrained, not in dark and quiet room, etc.) as in a traditional, highly constrained context. Our three Specific Aims will put in place the electronic, computational and mathematical technology necessary to address this hypothesis, and also to make such studies of free behavior in rhesus monkeys possible. The innovative integration of neural engineering, neuroscience, computer vision, mathematics and neural modeling will provide new tools to enable the unprecedented study of motor control during natural, unconstrained behavior.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research project is directly relevant to both basic neuroscience studies of higher brain function and to neural prosthesis research aimed at, ultimately, helping patients with motor disorders. We will conduct neurophysiological and behavioral experiments with rhesus monkeys in two different contexts - ""in home cage"" and ""in rig"" - to investigate the context dependence of motor cortical activity. With this knowledge, we will then design ""context independent"" models of the neural-behavioral relationship which we, and other researchers, could then use in neural prosthetic experiments while monkeys freely move around their less- constrained home cages.",Toward an Animal Model of Freely Moving Humans,8094411,R01NS066311,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Amputees', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Limb structure', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Social Interaction', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Technology', 'Wireless Technology', 'arm', 'design', 'free behavior', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'neural model', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'tool']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,1141716,0.07394022760989585
"Quantitative Analysis of PEM for REMBD Identification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder (RBD) refers to a condition in which patients act out their dreams and engage in potentially disruptive, injurious and even dangerous behavior while asleep[1-3]. Clinical reports of RBD have been shown to anticipate the development of neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's Disease by 20 years or more [4-6]. Despite this potential prognostic significance for human disease, the field of Sleep Medicine lacks an accepted computerized approach to quantify muscle activity in sleep. This proposed interdisciplinary research seeks to merge methods of computer engineering based computation with advanced neuroscience to establish a computerized clinical decision support system (CDSS) to detect RBD via measurement and analysis of the phasic electromyographic activity metric (PEM). The sponsor (Bliwise) has provided evidence based on traditional visual analyses from ""expert"" scorers that PEM recorded during sleep is a sensitive indicator a) to differentiate PD patients from controls [7]; b) to distinguish non-PD patients with a history of RBD from controls [8]; and c) to differentiate PD patients with early and late stage disease [9]. These data suggest that computer-aided PEM detection within a user-friendly CDSS will be vital for clinicians to determine prognosis, track disease course, and, possibly, even monitor treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    The proposed work is envisioned as a vital and integral component to establish standardized computerized bio-signal processing methods to detect phasic muscle activity in overnight human sleep polysomnograms for the identification and treatment of Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder.                 The proposed work is envisioned as a vital and integral component to establish standardized computerized bio-signal processing methods to detect phasic muscle activity in overnight human sleep polysomnograms for the identification and treatment of Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder.            ",Quantitative Analysis of PEM for REMBD Identification,8203202,F32NS070572,"['Acting Out', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bypass', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dangerous Behavior', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lewy Body Disease', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized', 'computerized data processing', 'evidence base', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'rapid eye movement', 'sensor', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F32,2011,53042,0.030478205280609492
"Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Over 600,000 Americans have severely impaired motor function from disorders including spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pontine stroke, and cerebral palsy. A brain-machine interface (BMI) could enable locked-in or tetraplegic patients to communicate and interact with their environment. Two crucial decisions in designing a BMI are (1) what type of brain signals to use as inputs to a controller and (2) what methods to use to decode those signals. Most BMIs have used either noninvasive scalp EEG recordings or invasive intracortical recordings of single- or multi-neuron spikes as control inputs. A few have used subdural or intracortical local field potentials (LFPs). However, no group has yet systematically compared these signals in motor cortex for use in BMI applications. This proposal's first goal is to assess the relative performance of spikes and field potentials (both intracortical and epidural) as control inputs for a variety of movement-related outputs. Epidural field potentials (EFPs) are intermediate in invasiveness, signal quality, stability and spatial resolution compared with existing scalp, subdural, and intracortical recordings, and thus represent an unexplored middle ground. This proposal's second goal is to evaluate linear and nonlinear techniques-including several novel to BMI applications-for both decoding data and reducing the inherently large dimensionality of data from multiple neural signals. The primary hypotheses of the proposed project are (1) that spikes will perform better in decoding more complex movement-related outputs, but that field potentials may perform similarly on decoding simpler outputs, and (2) that nonlinear decoders and dimensionality-reduction techniques may provide improved accuracy over linear methods. The specific aims to address these hypotheses are 1) to evaluate single neuron spikes as inputs to decoders of movement- related outputs, 2) to develop a novel epidural multi-electrode recording technique in the macaque monkey, and 3) to evaluate field potential signals as inputs to decoders of movement-related outputs. Aims 1 and 3 will involve application of dimensionality-reduction algorithms (e.g., independent components analysis, Isomap) and decoding algorithms (system identification, neural networks, support vector machines) to both spikes and field potentials. Aim 2 will entail using a computer model and spatial spectral analysis to optimize the epidural electrode array design. This project will provide the first comparison of spikes, LFPs and EFPs as inputs for identical BMI output applications. The supervision of Drs. Lee Miller and W. Zev Rymer, with additional guidance from Drs. Simon Levine, Jonathan Wolpaw and Nicholas Hatsopoulos, will provide the principal investigator with expertise in recording and processing both spikes and field potentials for BMI applications using a variety of state-of-the- art techniques. A comprehensive career development plan including clinical and research mentoring, seminars, and courses, will foster the candidate's transition into an independent physician-scientist.           n/a",Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface,8091226,K08NS060223,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Craniotomy', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pontine structure', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Visual', 'arm', 'brain machine interface', 'career development', 'computerized data processing', 'cranium', 'design', 'disability', 'feeding', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'motor control', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'surgical technique development']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2011,167832,0.04476034396508486
"Fully Implantable and Programmable Spike-based Codecs for Neuroprosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Often the disability is so severe that it is not possible to feed oneself or readily communicate. A new class of medical system termed brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) has emerged from research labs in the past decade and is now poised to dramatically improve these patients' quality of life. BMIs ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decode these electrical impulses in order to determine the intended movement. Initial versions of BMI systems that control a computer cursor are now in FDA Phase-I clinical trials, and numerous agencies are actively engaged in clinical translation (e.g., NIH, DARPA, VA). Creating control signals to enable an amputee to feed himself with a prosthetic (robotic) arm and hand will require decoding signals from thousands of electrodes, rather than the hundred or so signals current systems read, as well as encoding thousands of sensor signals from the arm and hand into thousands of artificial neural signals to be ""written into"" the brain, which has not yet been attempted. The lack of low-power (so that it can be implanted) electronic circuitry needed to run BMIs' encoding and decoding algorithms (termed codecs) is a fundamental barrier to successful clinical translation. The technologies available until now are too power-hungry (digital) or too algorithmically inflexible (analog) to meet the challenge. Recent advances in neuromorphic engineering make it now possible to build a fully implantable and programmable codec chip. This innovative approach combines digital's and analog's best features-programmability and efficiency-while offering far greater robustness than either. Meanwhile recent advances in neuroscience techniques make it now possible to obtain the knowledge needed to design the right algorithms to run on our codec chip. Optogenetic stimulaton can now be used to drive neurons in macaque cortex and computer vision can now be used to track freely moving monkeys while recording wirelessly. We propose to leverage these recent advances to dramatically increase prosthetic performance through the principled design of: (1) An entirely new class of encoders that can spatio-temporally pattern neural activity via optogenetic techniques. (2) An entirely new class of decoders that can operate in the real world with animals moving freely around in far less constrained settings. (3) An entirely new class of implantable programmable electronics that achieves the level of energy- efficiency required to run these complex algorithms. We will demonstrate our success by having a freely moving primate, with a 96-microelectrode recording array and a 9-channel optogenetic stimulator implanted in its premotor and somatosensory cortex, respectively, control a human-like robotic arm. Our ultimate goal is to realize the neuromorphic engineer's dream: Helping untold millions with neurological injury by replacing damaged neural tissue with chips that work like the brain.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment.

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7798636,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease diagnosis', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2010,35821,0.024974572815822434
"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.

"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal. The new technology will be tested in two applied studies that will be carried out concurrently with the technical developments. One will investigate neural modifications in the firing characteristics of motor units as a function of aging and physical activity. The other will investigate the mitigating effects of resistive exercise on age-related neural adaptations, culminating in the development of a clinical marker to estimate the likelihood that an elderly individual will benefit from an exercise program.

"Wearable-Sensor System for Monitoring Motor Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a wearable Personal Status Monitor for improving the medication management of Parkinson's Disease patients by monitoring the effects of the medication continuously during the day. New outcome measures are needed to supplement the self-reports currently in use that are ineffective in managing the complex and unpredictable nature of movement disorders in this population. The device we propose to develop can be worn unobtrusively by patients in their home to automatically provide the following clinically significant information: 1) the presence and severity of specific primary and secondary movement disorders associated with the disease, 2) the status of  On-Off motor fluctuation in response to anti-Parkinson's medication, and 3) the mobility status of the patient. The patient will be monitored by specially designed electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometric (ACC) body-worn sensors. Their signals will be analyzed by a novel Artificial Intelligence knowledge-based signal processing method developed by our group specifically for this purpose. Success of the system will be based on classification accuracy compared to observation by experts. The proposal is composed of two projects. The first and dominant project will develop the underlying technological requirements for the PSM system's application to Parkinson's disease. The aims will include acquisition hardware development in the form of hybrid EMG/ACC sensors. However, the emphasis will be on the development of the knowledge-based algorithms and their software implementation. The second project is designed to acquire the knowledge base needed in Project 1 through data collection experiments from control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease. The experiments are designed to advance the algorithm development in a hierarchical manner starting from highly standardized activities to free-form activities which approximate real-world conditions. The development of the system will be constructed so that future versions can be adapted to other movement disorders.

"Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Over 600,000 Americans have severely impaired motor function from disorders including spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pontine stroke, and cerebral palsy. A brain-machine interface (BMI) could enable locked-in or tetraplegic patients to communicate and interact with their environment. Two crucial decisions in designing a BMI are (1) what type of brain signals to use as inputs to a controller and (2) what methods to use to decode those signals. Most BMIs have used either noninvasive scalp EEG recordings or invasive intracortical recordings of single- or multi-neuron spikes as control inputs. A few have used subdural or intracortical local field potentials (LFPs). However, no group has yet systematically compared these signals in motor cortex for use in BMI applications. This proposal's first goal is to assess the relative performance of spikes and field potentials (both intracortical and epidural) as control inputs for a variety of movement-related outputs. Epidural field potentials (EFPs) are intermediate in invasiveness, signal quality, stability and spatial resolution compared with existing scalp, subdural, and intracortical recordings, and thus represent an unexplored middle ground. This proposal's second goal is to evaluate linear and nonlinear techniques-including several novel to BMI applications-for both decoding data and reducing the inherently large dimensionality of data from multiple neural signals. The primary hypotheses of the proposed project are (1) that spikes will perform better in decoding more complex movement-related outputs, but that field potentials may perform similarly on decoding simpler outputs, and (2) that nonlinear decoders and dimensionality-reduction techniques may provide improved accuracy over linear methods. The specific aims to address these hypotheses are 1) to evaluate single neuron spikes as inputs to decoders of movement- related outputs, 2) to develop a novel epidural multi-electrode recording technique in the macaque monkey, and 3) to evaluate field potential signals as inputs to decoders of movement-related outputs. Aims 1 and 3 will involve application of dimensionality-reduction algorithms (e.g., independent components analysis, Isomap) and decoding algorithms (system identification, neural networks, support vector machines) to both spikes and field potentials. Aim 2 will entail using a computer model and spatial spectral analysis to optimize the epidural electrode array design. This project will provide the first comparison of spikes, LFPs and EFPs as inputs for identical BMI output applications. The supervision of Drs. Lee Miller and W. Zev Rymer, with additional guidance from Drs. Simon Levine, Jonathan Wolpaw and Nicholas Hatsopoulos, will provide the principal investigator with expertise in recording and processing both spikes and field potentials for BMI applications using a variety of state-of-the- art techniques. A comprehensive career development plan including clinical and research mentoring, seminars, and courses, will foster the candidate's transition into an independent physician-scientist.           n/a",Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface,7876844,K08NS060223,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Arts', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Craniotomy', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pontine structure', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Visual', 'arm', 'brain machine interface', 'career development', 'computerized data processing', 'cranium', 'design', 'disability', 'feeding', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'motor control', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'surgical technique development']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2010,167832,0.04476034396508486
"Perceptual Learning: Human vs. Optimal Bayesian    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neural plasticity and perceptual learning are fundamental in the developmental stages of vision, in attaining expertise in specialized perceptual tasks, and in recovery from brain injuries and low- vision disorders. One important process in perceptual learning is the improvement in humans' ability to use task-relevant (signal) information. Although there have been advances in the understanding of the dynamics and algorithms mediating how humans optimize the selection of task relevant visual information, little is known about how eye movement patterns vary with practice and their impact in optimizing perceptual performance. Yet, in real world environments, eye movements are a critical component of active vision as humans explore the visual scene to make perceptual judgments. Understanding perceptual learning in human daily life requires studying the mechanisms mediating the changes in the planning of eye movements with learning and their contributions to optimizing perceptual performance. We hypothesize that two new experimental paradigms with digitally designed visual stimuli, in conjunction with eye position recording, and a newly developed foveated ideal observer and Bayesian learner will help elucidate how humans learn to strategize their eye movements and the contributions of the optimized sampling of the images to improvements in perceptual learning. The proposed work will address the following questions: 1) Do humans use learned information about the statistical properties of the visual stimuli and the requirements of the task at hand to strategize their eye movements to optimize the foveal sampling of the visual scene and perceptual performance?; 2) Do humans use knowledge of the varying resolution of their foveated visual system to optimally learn to plan eye movements for a given set of visual stimuli and task?; 3) What are the contributions of learning to strategize eye movements to the overall improvements in perceptual performance in ecologically important tasks such as face recognition, object identification and visual search?; 4) How do human fixation patterns and performance benefits from strategizing eye movements compare to an optimal foveated observer and learner? The proposed work will improve our understanding of the human neural algorithms mediating the dynamics of adult perceptual learning during active vision for ecologically important tasks. The proposed experimental protocols and theoretical developments will also provide a novel, powerful and flexible framework with which other researchers can study eye movements and learning of humans undergoing visual loss recovery as well as patients with learning disabilities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work benefits public health by increasing our understanding of how humans learn to move their eyes to potentially informative regions of the visual scene in important daily tasks such as identifying faces or searching for objects. Thorough understanding of these mechanisms in normal humans will allow identification of learning anomalies in patients recovering from visual-loss or learning disabilities and potentially develop tests to assess treatments.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  The proposed work benefits public health by increasing our understanding of how  humans learn to move their eyes to potentially informative regions of the visual scene in  important daily tasks such as identifying faces or searching for objects.

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7616408,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease diagnosis', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2009,35821,0.024974572815822434
"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal. The new technology will be tested in two applied studies that will be carried out concurrently with the technical developments. One will investigate neural modifications in the firing characteristics of motor units as a function of aging and physical activity. The other will investigate the mitigating effects of resistive exercise on age-related neural adaptations, culminating in the development of a clinical marker to estimate the likelihood that an elderly individual will benefit from an exercise program. The proposed BRP will be lead by Drs. De Luca, Roy, and Adam, key personnel from Boston University (BU) with expertise in biomedical engineering and EMG system development.

"Toward an Animal Model of Freely Moving Humans Our overarching goal is to establish an animal model of freely moving humans. We choose to do so in order to directly measure the context-dependency of motor cortical activity and, ultimately, other activity reliant upon free movement such as social interaction among animals. Achieving this major technological challenge requires a complete system that includes (Specific Aim 1) wireless transmission of neural data from electrode arrays chronically implanted in monkeys, (Specific Aim 2) computer-vision algorithms to automatically extract body and limb orientation during free movement, and (Specific Aim 3) new mathematical and computational models to represent and extract information from high-dimensional neural and behavioral activity. This technology will enable an animal model of freely moving humans that will advance the development of cortical neural prostheses by providing models of the context-dependant nature of motor cortical control.  Unlike traditional laboratory environments used to study animal movement, human amputees and tetraplegics operate in a variety of contexts that involve their movement in the world. Understanding the motor control of complex movement in these natural settings is absolutely critical for future advances in cortically- controlled prostheses. Given our overarching goal, our hypothesis is that motor cortical activity (e.g., directional tuning curves, absolute firing rates, correlations among units, etc.) will be different in important ways when rhesus monkeys perform the same reaching arm movements in an un-constrained context (e.g., not sitting quietly, not head restrained, not in dark and quiet room, etc.) as in a traditional, highly constrained context. Our three Specific Aims will put in place the electronic, computational and mathematical technology necessary to address this hypothesis, and also to make such studies of free behavior in rhesus monkeys possible. The innovative integration of neural engineering, neuroscience, computer vision, mathematics and neural modeling will provide new tools to enable the unprecedented study of motor control during natural, unconstrained behavior.

"Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for ""Neurotechnology Research, Development, and Enhancement"" (PA-04-006) proposes the development of innovative technologies, methodologies, and instrumentation to advance our understanding of neural control mechanisms of muscle force production through a non-invasive means of recording neuronal firing patterns. The project will develop an automatic system to accurately and quickly decompose the surface Electromyographic (sEMG) signal into its constituent action potentials and provide the timing of the firings of concurrently active motor units. The goal is to achieve an accuracy of >85% in the automatic mode and >96% with the assistance of an interactive editor. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system by simply placing a sensor above a muscle with no assault to the CNS. The sEMG Decomposition System will replace existing technology that relies on invasive procedures to detect the EMG signal through needle or fine-wire electrodes. The proposed work includes: 1) mathematical modeling and empirical studies to develop a sEMG electrode array that maximizes shape differences of motor unit firings and thereby facilitates sEMG signal decomposition; 2) algorithm development using artificial intelligence technology of our own design combined with Principal Component Analysis techniques; and 3) data acquisition/processing software and hardware to build a portable prototype surface decomposition system. Performance testing of the system will be conducted using data collection experiments to ensure that the system is comparable in motor unit yield, processing speed, and accuracy to the current state-of-the art indwelling decomposition system. We will also prove that the signal decomposition is performed correctly by decomposing two separately collected signals and matching the results. A dissemination plan is included to make this technology available to the Motor Control community. Commercialization will be realized through Altec Inc.

"Wearable-Sensor System for Monitoring Motor Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a wearable Personal Status Monitor for improving the medication management of Parkinson's Disease patients by monitoring the effects of the medication continuously during the day. New outcome measures are needed to supplement the self-reports currently in use that are ineffective in managing the complex and unpredictable nature of movement disorders in this population. The device we propose to develop can be worn unobtrusively by patients in their home to automatically provide the following clinically significant information: 1) the presence and severity of specific primary and secondary movement disorders associated with the disease, 2) the status of  On-Off motor fluctuation in response to anti-Parkinson's medication, and 3) the mobility status of the patient. The patient will be monitored by specially designed electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometric (ACC) body-worn sensors.

"Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Over 600,000 Americans have severely impaired motor function from disorders including spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pontine stroke, and cerebral palsy. A brain-machine interface (BMI) could enable locked-in or tetraplegic patients to communicate and interact with their environment. Two crucial decisions in designing a BMI are (1) what type of brain signals to use as inputs to a controller and (2) what methods to use to decode those signals. Most BMIs have used either noninvasive scalp EEG recordings or invasive intracortical recordings of single- or multi-neuron spikes as control inputs. A few have used subdural or intracortical local field potentials (LFPs). However, no group has yet systematically compared these signals in motor cortex for use in BMI applications. This proposal's first goal is to assess the relative performance of spikes and field potentials (both intracortical and epidural) as control inputs for a variety of movement-related outputs. Epidural field potentials (EFPs) are intermediate in invasiveness, signal quality, stability and spatial resolution compared with existing scalp, subdural, and intracortical recordings, and thus represent an unexplored middle ground. This proposal's second goal is to evaluate linear and nonlinear techniques-including several novel to BMI applications-for both decoding data and reducing the inherently large dimensionality of data from multiple neural signals. The primary hypotheses of the proposed project are (1) that spikes will perform better in decoding more complex movement-related outputs, but that field potentials may perform similarly on decoding simpler outputs, and (2) that nonlinear decoders and dimensionality-reduction techniques may provide improved accuracy over linear methods. The specific aims to address these hypotheses are 1) to evaluate single neuron spikes as inputs to decoders of movement- related outputs, 2) to develop a novel epidural multi-electrode recording technique in the macaque monkey, and 3) to evaluate field potential signals as inputs to decoders of movement-related outputs. Aims 1 and 3 will involve application of dimensionality-reduction algorithms (e.g., independent components analysis, Isomap) and decoding algorithms (system identification, neural networks, support vector machines) to both spikes and field potentials. Aim 2 will entail using a computer model and spatial spectral analysis to optimize the epidural electrode array design. This project will provide the first comparison of spikes, LFPs and EFPs as inputs for identical BMI output applications. The supervision of Drs. Lee Miller and W. Zev Rymer, with additional guidance from Drs. Simon Levine, Jonathan Wolpaw and Nicholas Hatsopoulos, will provide the principal investigator with expertise in recording and processing both spikes and field potentials for BMI applications using a variety of state-of-the- art techniques. A comprehensive career development plan including clinical and research mentoring, seminars, and courses, will foster the candidate's transition into an independent physician-scientist.           n/a",Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface,7643089,K08NS060223,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Arts', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Craniotomy', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pontine structure', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Upper arm', 'Visual', 'brain machine interface', 'career development', 'computerized data processing', 'cranium', 'design', 'disability', 'feeding', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'motor control', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'surgical technique development']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2009,167832,0.04476034396508486
"CRCNS: Where to look next? Modeling eye movements in normal and impaired vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of the information processing and decision strategies that underlie eye movement planning in both the normal and diseased state. In patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central areas of the retina are damaged, creating a large blind spot that forces them to rely solely on residual vision in the periphery. Rehabilitation outcomes for these patients can be successful, but are often inconsistent. Despite similar retinopathies, some patients learn to use their residual vision more effectively than others. We have developed an information-theoretic model and experimental paradigm which will allow us to objectively measure human scanning efficiency. The development of the model has naturally motivated fundamental experimental questions about eye movements and neural decision making. The answers to these questions will be used to refine the model and enhance our understanding of the system in general. We will then apply the model framework to investigate differences in eye movement behavior between AMD patients and normally-sighted individuals. The interplay of model development and experimental investigation will significantly increase our knowledge of how humans use prior knowledge and task demands to direct their gaze, and how new visual information is incorporated into an eye movement plan. The results will have broad relevance to understanding neural decision making in general.   Relevance to Public Health. The application of the model to a clinical population will bring much-needed objective measures to understanding the extent of impairment in individuals with AMD. With this understanding comes great potential for improving rehabilitation training strategies that will enhance the quality of life for these patients and their families.          n/a",CRCNS: Where to look next?

"Motor Learning for the Control of an Assistive Device The goal of these studies is to understand how movements of the body can be harnessed and trained to control electrically powered wheelchairs. Advanced wheelchair technology is often perceived to be a barrier by a large number of potential wheelchair users. An approach is proposed for the removal of this barrier based on adapting the assistive technology to the residual unconstrained mobility of the patients and on enhancing motor learning. This exploratory project aims at establishing the feasibility of such an approach and at developing training methods based on the identification of natural motions and on the use of virtual reality (VR). The proposed studies will be carried out on quadriplegic spinal cord injured patients with complete or incomplete cervical injuries. Healthy volunteers will also participate in these study to fine-tune the experimental apparatus and to provide a reference baseline to assess learning and coordination. Subjects will wear a novel upper-body sensing garment. A total of 52 electrical signals generated by the garment will be modulated by movements of the wrist, elbow, shoulder and torso. These signals will be mapped into the velocity commands for a simulated wheelchair. Subjects will wear VR-goggles and a head tracker, which will provide them with a immersive view of a computer-generated environment from the perspective of the simulated wheelchair. The combination of virtual reality environments and wearable signal technology will provide a framework for evaluating training protocols that would not be feasible with actual wheelchairs. The proposed studies are organized in two specific aims: (Aim 1.) To identify motor primitives for the control of a virtual wheelchair by unrestricted upper body motions Three well-established signal processing techniques - Principal Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis and Isomap - will be used and compared for extracting low-dimensional signal patterns from the garment signals (Aim 2.) To identify maps and procedures that facilitate motor learning. The signal patterns extracted from Aim 1 will be used to design and test new transformations from subject motions to wheelchair commands. A well- known machine learning technique -least mean squares gradient descent - will be tested for matching the natural motor primitives of the subjects with an appropriate set of control signals to the wheelchair. Finally the safe VR environment will allow us to test whether it is most efficient to learn by gradually speeding up wheelchair motions or by gradually slowing them down. The results of these studies are expected to guide the development of new technology for assistive devices based on human motor learning and on engineering of adaptive control. Many disabled individuals are facing difficult challenges to take advantage of assistive technologies. In particular the safe and efficient use of powered wheelchair is limited by the need for patients to learn to operate their control apparatus. The proposed studies will investigate the possibility to reverse this situation and take advantage of advanced technologies for adapting the control apparatus to the residual skills of the patients. n/a",Motor Learning for the Control of an Assistive Device,7488480,R21HD053608,"['Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Development', 'Elbow', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Goggles', 'Head', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quadriplegia', 'Residual state', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Wheelchairs', 'Wrist', 'base', 'body sense', 'computer generated', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'healthy volunteer', 'independent component analysis', 'motor learning', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NICHD,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R21,2008,98314,0.08111032221818565
"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7392804,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Numbers', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2008,35821,0.024974572815822434
"Development of a Bidirectional Brain Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have made it possible to move a robotic device in real time, using signals obtained directly from the brain. This field of Brain Machine Interface (BMI) has the means to provide movement for paralyzed patients, communication for locked-in patients, and a better understanding of the brain for all of society. In order to control movement effectively, the brain must be able to activate muscles appropriately, and monitor the evolving movement quickly and precisely. Existing BMIs for, while remarkable, do each of these tasks in poor imitation of the intact nervous system. Our proposed work addresses these limitations by developing a bidirectional interface that produces movement in a more natural way, and provides feedback about the movement by direct, electrical stimulation of the brain. Our partnership includes members at Northwestern Univ (NU), Univ of Chicago (UC), Univ of Mass, Amherst (UMass), and the autonomous Univ of Mexico (UNAM). Partners have advanced degrees in a range of biological science, computer science, physics, mathematics, and engineering disciplines. Miller (NU) will coordinate the partnership. He has extensive experience with a wide range of recording, stimulation and behavioral protocols in behaving monkeys. Hatsopoulos (UC) is at the forefront of the field of multi-electrode recordings. He was a leading member of the first group to demonstrate visually guided BMI control by a primate. Barto (U Mass) has done pioneering research in neural networks, machine learning and stochastic optimization. Fagg (UMass) is an authority in the control of reaching and grasping robots that learn to interact with the environment. Together they will develop the decoders of activity from the brain used to cause movement. Romo (UNAM), is a world leader in studies of the perceptual and decision making processes induced by electrical stimulation of the brain. Solla (NU) is an expert in neural networks and information theory. With Romo, she will develop optimal routines to encode information in stimulus trains to provide feedback to the brain.

"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal. The new technology will be tested in two applied studies that will be carried out concurrently with the technical developments. One will investigate neural modifications in the firing characteristics of motor units as a function of aging and physical activity. The other will investigate the mitigating effects of resistive exercise on age-related neural adaptations, culminating in the development of a clinical marker to estimate the likelihood that an elderly individual will benefit from an exercise program.

"Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for ""Neurotechnology Research, Development, and Enhancement"" (PA-04-006) proposes the development of innovative technologies, methodologies, and instrumentation to advance our understanding of neural control mechanisms of muscle force production through a non-invasive means of recording neuronal firing patterns. The project will develop an automatic system to accurately and quickly decompose the surface Electromyographic (sEMG) signal into its constituent action potentials and provide the timing of the firings of concurrently active motor units. The goal is to achieve an accuracy of >85% in the automatic mode and >96% with the assistance of an interactive editor. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system by simply placing a sensor above a muscle with no assault to the CNS. The sEMG Decomposition System will replace existing technology that relies on invasive procedures to detect the EMG signal through needle or fine-wire electrodes. The proposed work includes: 1) mathematical modeling and empirical studies to develop a sEMG electrode array that maximizes shape differences of motor unit firings and thereby facilitates sEMG signal decomposition; 2) algorithm development using artificial intelligence technology of our own design combined with Principal Component Analysis techniques; and 3) data acquisition/processing software and hardware to build a portable prototype surface decomposition system. Performance testing of the system will be conducted using data collection experiments to ensure that the system is comparable in motor unit yield, processing speed, and accuracy to the current state-of-the art indwelling decomposition system. We will also prove that the signal decomposition is performed correctly by decomposing two separately collected signals and matching the results. A dissemination plan is included to make this technology available to the Motor Control community. Commercialization will be realized through Altec Inc. This technology will enable researchers in the fields of Motor Control, Aging, Exercise Physiology, Space Medicine, and Ergonomics, where it is of interest to understand how the CNS controls muscles, and how that control is altered as a consequence of aging, exercise, exposure to microgravity, fatigue, and excessive and prolonged force production. It will be useful to clinicians for assessing the degree of dysfunction in upper motoneuron diseases such as Cerebral Palsy, Parkinson's Disease, ALS, Stroke, and other disorders.              n/a",Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior,7489322,R01NS058250,"['Action Potentials', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'International', 'Invasive', 'Left', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Microgravity', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle Fibers', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Needles', 'Neurons', 'Numbers', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Right-On', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Space Medicine', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'assault', 'base', 'commercialization', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'ergonomics', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'motor control', 'neuromuscular system', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotechnology', 'new technology', 'non-invasive system', 'performance tests', 'processing speed', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'technology/technique']",NINDS,"ALTEC, INC.",R01,2008,455129,0.07658055914889912
"Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Over 600,000 Americans have severely impaired motor function from disorders including spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pontine stroke, and cerebral palsy. A brain-machine interface (BMI) could enable locked-in or tetraplegic patients to communicate and interact with their environment. Two crucial decisions in designing a BMI are (1) what type of brain signals to use as inputs to a controller and (2) what methods to use to decode those signals. Most BMIs have used either noninvasive scalp EEG recordings or invasive intracortical recordings of single- or multi-neuron spikes as control inputs. A few have used subdural or intracortical local field potentials (LFPs). However, no group has yet systematically compared these signals in motor cortex for use in BMI applications. This proposal's first goal is to assess the relative performance of spikes and field potentials (both intracortical and epidural) as control inputs for a variety of movement-related outputs. Epidural field potentials (EFPs) are intermediate in invasiveness, signal quality, stability and spatial resolution compared with existing scalp, subdural, and intracortical recordings, and thus represent an unexplored middle ground. This proposal's second goal is to evaluate linear and nonlinear techniques-including several novel to BMI applications-for both decoding data and reducing the inherently large dimensionality of data from multiple neural signals. The primary hypotheses of the proposed project are (1) that spikes will perform better in decoding more complex movement-related outputs, but that field potentials may perform similarly on decoding simpler outputs, and (2) that nonlinear decoders and dimensionality-reduction techniques may provide improved accuracy over linear methods. The specific aims to address these hypotheses are 1) to evaluate single neuron spikes as inputs to decoders of movement- related outputs, 2) to develop a novel epidural multi-electrode recording technique in the macaque monkey, and 3) to evaluate field potential signals as inputs to decoders of movement-related outputs. Aims 1 and 3 will involve application of dimensionality-reduction algorithms (e.g., independent components analysis, Isomap) and decoding algorithms (system identification, neural networks, support vector machines) to both spikes and field potentials. Aim 2 will entail using a computer model and spatial spectral analysis to optimize the epidural electrode array design. This project will provide the first comparison of spikes, LFPs and EFPs as inputs for identical BMI output applications. The supervision of Drs. Lee Miller and W. Zev Rymer, with additional guidance from Drs. Simon Levine, Jonathan Wolpaw and Nicholas Hatsopoulos, will provide the principal investigator with expertise in recording and processing both spikes and field potentials for BMI applications using a variety of state-of-the- art techniques. A comprehensive career development plan including clinical and research mentoring, seminars, and courses, will foster the candidate's transition into an independent physician-scientist.           n/a",Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface,7470575,K08NS060223,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Arts', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Count', 'Craniotomy', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Dura Mater', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Invasive', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pontine structure', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Upper arm', 'Visual', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'computerized data processing', 'cranium', 'design', 'disability', 'feeding', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'motor control', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'surgical technique development']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2008,167832,0.04476034396508486
"CRCNS: Where to look next? Modeling eye movements in normal and impaired vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of the information processing and decision strategies that underlie eye movement planning in both the normal and diseased state. In patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central areas of the retina are damaged, creating a large blind spot that forces them to rely solely on residual vision in the periphery. Rehabilitation outcomes for these patients can be successful, but are often inconsistent. Despite similar retinopathies, some patients learn to use their residual vision more effectively than others. We have developed an information-theoretic model and experimental paradigm which will allow us to objectively measure human scanning efficiency. The development of the model has naturally motivated fundamental experimental questions about eye movements and neural decision making. The answers to these questions will be used to refine the model and enhance our understanding of the system in general. We will then apply the model framework to investigate differences in eye movement behavior between AMD patients and normally-sighted individuals. The interplay of model development and experimental investigation will significantly increase our knowledge of how humans use prior knowledge and task demands to direct their gaze, and how new visual information is incorporated into an eye movement plan. The results will have broad relevance to understanding neural decision making in general.   Relevance to Public Health. The application of the model to a clinical population will bring much-needed objective measures to understanding the extent of impairment in individuals with AMD. With this understanding comes great potential for improving rehabilitation training strategies that will enhance the quality of life for these patients and their families.          n/a",CRCNS: Where to look next?

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7269518,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Numbers', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2007,35821,0.024974572815822434
"Motor Learning for the Control of an Assistive Device    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of these studies is to understand how movements of the body can be harnessed and trained to control electrically powered wheelchairs. Advanced wheelchair technology is often perceived to be a barrier by a large number of potential wheelchair users. An approach is proposed for the removal of this barrier based on adapting the assistive technology to the residual unconstrained mobility of the patients and on enhancing motor learning. This exploratory project aims at establishing the feasibility of such an approach and at developing training methods based on the identification of natural motions and on the use of virtual reality (VR). The proposed studies will be carried out on quadriplegic spinal cord injured patients with complete or incomplete cervical injuries. Healthy volunteers will also participate in these study to fine-tune the experimental apparatus and to provide a reference baseline to assess learning and coordination. Subjects will wear a novel upper-body sensing garment. A total of 52 electrical signals generated by the garment will be modulated by movements of the wrist, elbow, shoulder and torso. These signals will be mapped into the velocity commands for a simulated wheelchair. Subjects will wear VR-goggles and a head tracker, which will provide them with a immersive view of a computer-generated environment from the perspective of the simulated wheelchair. The combination of virtual reality environments and wearable signal technology will provide a framework for evaluating training protocols that would not be feasible with actual wheelchairs. The proposed studies are organized in two specific aims: (Aim 1.) To identify motor primitives for the control of a virtual wheelchair by unrestricted upper body motions Three well-established signal processing techniques - Principal Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis and Isomap - will be used and compared for extracting low-dimensional signal patterns from the garment signals (Aim 2.) To identify maps and procedures that facilitate motor learning. The signal patterns extracted from Aim 1 will be used to design and test new transformations from subject motions to wheelchair commands. A well- known machine learning technique -least mean squares gradient descent - will be tested for matching the natural motor primitives of the subjects with an appropriate set of control signals to the wheelchair. Finally the safe VR environment will allow us to test whether it is most efficient to learn by gradually speeding up wheelchair motions or by gradually slowing them down. The results of these studies are expected to guide the development of new technology for assistive devices based on human motor learning and on engineering of adaptive control. Many disabled individuals are facing difficult challenges to take advantage of assistive technologies. In particular the safe and efficient use of powered wheelchair is limited by the need for patients to learn to operate their control apparatus. The proposed studies will investigate the possibility to reverse this situation and take advantage of advanced technologies for adapting the control apparatus to the residual skills of the patients.       n/a",Motor Learning for the Control of an Assistive Device,7258179,R21HD053608,"['Accidents', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Asia', 'Behavior', 'Biomechanics', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elbow', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Goggles', 'Head', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quadriplegia', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Wheelchairs', 'Wrist', 'base', 'body sense', 'computer generated', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'disability', 'healthy volunteer', 'independent component analysis', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'motor learning', 'new technology', 'novel', 'research study', 'skills', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NICHD,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO,R21,2007,225323,0.08109897066948195
"Development of a Bidirectional Brain Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have made it possible to move a robotic device in real time, using signals obtained directly from the brain. This field of Brain Machine Interface (BMI) has the means to provide movement for paralyzed patients, communication for locked-in patients, and a better understanding of the brain for all of society. In order to control movement effectively, the brain must be able to activate muscles appropriately, and monitor the evolving movement quickly and precisely. Existing BMIs for, while remarkable, do each of these tasks in poor imitation of the intact nervous system. Our proposed work addresses these limitations by developing a bidirectional interface that produces movement in a more natural way, and provides feedback about the movement by direct, electrical stimulation of the brain. Our partnership includes members at Northwestern Univ (NU), Univ of Chicago (UC), Univ of Mass, Amherst (UMass), and the autonomous Univ of Mexico (UNAM). Partners have advanced degrees in a range of biological science, computer science, physics, mathematics, and engineering disciplines. Miller (NU) will coordinate the partnership. He has extensive experience with a wide range of recording, stimulation and behavioral protocols in behaving monkeys. Hatsopoulos (UC) is at the forefront of the field of multi-electrode recordings. He was a leading member of the first group to demonstrate visually guided BMI control by a primate. Barto (U Mass) has done pioneering research in neural networks, machine learning and stochastic optimization. Fagg (UMass) is an authority in the control of reaching and grasping robots that learn to interact with the environment. Together they will develop the decoders of activity from the brain used to cause movement. Romo (UNAM), is a world leader in studies of the perceptual and decision making processes induced by electrical stimulation of the brain. Solla (NU) is an expert in neural networks and information theory. With Romo, she will develop optimal routines to encode information in stimulus trains to provide feedback to the brain.

"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal. The new technology will be tested in two applied studies that will be carried out concurrently with the technical developments. One will investigate neural modifications in the firing characteristics of motor units as a function of aging and physical activity. The other will investigate the mitigating effects of resistive exercise on age-related neural adaptations, culminating in the development of a clinical marker to estimate the likelihood that an elderly individual will benefit from an exercise program.

"Wearable-Sensor System for Monitoring Motor Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a wearable Personal Status Monitor for improving the medication management of Parkinson's Disease patients by monitoring the effects of the medication continuously during the day. New outcome measures are needed to supplement the self-reports currently in use that are ineffective in managing the complex and unpredictable nature of movement disorders in this population. The device we propose to develop can be worn unobtrusively by patients in their home to automatically provide the following clinically significant information: 1) the presence and severity of specific primary and secondary movement disorders associated with the disease, 2) the status of  On-Off motor fluctuation in response to anti-Parkinson's medication, and 3) the mobility status of the patient. The patient will be monitored by specially designed electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometric (ACC) body-worn sensors. Their signals will be analyzed by a novel Artificial Intelligence knowledge-based signal processing method developed by our group specifically for this purpose. Success of the system will be based on classification accuracy compared to observation by experts. The proposal is composed of two projects. The first and dominant project will develop the underlying technological requirements for the PSM system's application to Parkinson's disease. The aims will include acquisition hardware development in the form of hybrid EMG/ACC sensors. However, the emphasis will be on the development of the knowledge-based algorithms and their software implementation. The second project is designed to acquire the knowledge base needed in Project 1 through data collection experiments from control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease.

"Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for ""Neurotechnology Research, Development, and Enhancement"" (PA-04-006) proposes the development of innovative technologies, methodologies, and instrumentation to advance our understanding of neural control mechanisms of muscle force production through a non-invasive means of recording neuronal firing patterns. The project will develop an automatic system to accurately and quickly decompose the surface Electromyographic (sEMG) signal into its constituent action potentials and provide the timing of the firings of concurrently active motor units. The goal is to achieve an accuracy of >85% in the automatic mode and >96% with the assistance of an interactive editor. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system by simply placing a sensor above a muscle with no assault to the CNS. The sEMG Decomposition System will replace existing technology that relies on invasive procedures to detect the EMG signal through needle or fine-wire electrodes. The proposed work includes: 1) mathematical modeling and empirical studies to develop a sEMG electrode array that maximizes shape differences of motor unit firings and thereby facilitates sEMG signal decomposition; 2) algorithm development using artificial intelligence technology of our own design combined with Principal Component Analysis techniques; and 3) data acquisition/processing software and hardware to build a portable prototype surface decomposition system. Performance testing of the system will be conducted using data collection experiments to ensure that the system is comparable in motor unit yield, processing speed, and accuracy to the current state-of-the art indwelling decomposition system. We will also prove that the signal decomposition is performed correctly by decomposing two separately collected signals and matching the results. A dissemination plan is included to make this technology available to the Motor Control community. Commercialization will be realized through Altec Inc. This technology will enable researchers in the fields of Motor Control, Aging, Exercise Physiology, Space Medicine, and Ergonomics, where it is of interest to understand how the CNS controls muscles, and how that control is altered as a consequence of aging, exercise, exposure to microgravity, fatigue, and excessive and prolonged force production.

"Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Over 600,000 Americans have severely impaired motor function from disorders including spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pontine stroke, and cerebral palsy. A brain-machine interface (BMI) could enable locked-in or tetraplegic patients to communicate and interact with their environment. Two crucial decisions in designing a BMI are (1) what type of brain signals to use as inputs to a controller and (2) what methods to use to decode those signals. Most BMIs have used either noninvasive scalp EEG recordings or invasive intracortical recordings of single- or multi-neuron spikes as control inputs. A few have used subdural or intracortical local field potentials (LFPs). However, no group has yet systematically compared these signals in motor cortex for use in BMI applications. This proposal's first goal is to assess the relative performance of spikes and field potentials (both intracortical and epidural) as control inputs for a variety of movement-related outputs. Epidural field potentials (EFPs) are intermediate in invasiveness, signal quality, stability and spatial resolution compared with existing scalp, subdural, and intracortical recordings, and thus represent an unexplored middle ground. This proposal's second goal is to evaluate linear and nonlinear techniques-including several novel to BMI applications-for both decoding data and reducing the inherently large dimensionality of data from multiple neural signals. The primary hypotheses of the proposed project are (1) that spikes will perform better in decoding more complex movement-related outputs, but that field potentials may perform similarly on decoding simpler outputs, and (2) that nonlinear decoders and dimensionality-reduction techniques may provide improved accuracy over linear methods. The specific aims to address these hypotheses are 1) to evaluate single neuron spikes as inputs to decoders of movement- related outputs, 2) to develop a novel epidural multi-electrode recording technique in the macaque monkey, and 3) to evaluate field potential signals as inputs to decoders of movement-related outputs. Aims 1 and 3 will involve application of dimensionality-reduction algorithms (e.g., independent components analysis, Isomap) and decoding algorithms (system identification, neural networks, support vector machines) to both spikes and field potentials. Aim 2 will entail using a computer model and spatial spectral analysis to optimize the epidural electrode array design. This project will provide the first comparison of spikes, LFPs and EFPs as inputs for identical BMI output applications. The supervision of Drs. Lee Miller and W. Zev Rymer, with additional guidance from Drs. Simon Levine, Jonathan Wolpaw and Nicholas Hatsopoulos, will provide the principal investigator with expertise in recording and processing both spikes and field potentials for BMI applications using a variety of state-of-the- art techniques. A comprehensive career development plan including clinical and research mentoring, seminars, and courses, will foster the candidate's transition into an independent physician-scientist.           n/a",Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface,7318680,K08NS060223,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Arts', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Count', 'Craniotomy', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Dura Mater', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Invasive', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pontine structure', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Upper arm', 'Visual', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'computerized data processing', 'cranium', 'design', 'disability', 'feeding', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'motor control', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'surgical technique development']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2007,167832,0.04476034396508486
"CRCNS: Where to look next? Modeling eye movements in normal and impaired vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of the information processing and decision strategies that underlie eye movement planning in both the normal and diseased state. In patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central areas of the retina are damaged, creating a large blind spot that forces them to rely solely on residual vision in the periphery. Rehabilitation outcomes for these patients can be successful, but are often inconsistent. Despite similar retinopathies, some patients learn to use their residual vision more effectively than others. We have developed an information-theoretic model and experimental paradigm which will allow us to objectively measure human scanning efficiency. The development of the model has naturally motivated fundamental experimental questions about eye movements and neural decision making. The answers to these questions will be used to refine the model and enhance our understanding of the system in general. We will then apply the model framework to investigate differences in eye movement behavior between AMD patients and normally-sighted individuals. The interplay of model development and experimental investigation will significantly increase our knowledge of how humans use prior knowledge and task demands to direct their gaze, and how new visual information is incorporated into an eye movement plan. The results will have broad relevance to understanding neural decision making in general.   Relevance to Public Health. The application of the model to a clinical population will bring much-needed objective measures to understanding the extent of impairment in individuals with AMD. With this understanding comes great potential for improving rehabilitation training strategies that will enhance the quality of life for these patients and their families.          n/a",CRCNS: Where to look next?

"INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF UPPER EXTREMITY NEURAL PROSTHESES INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF UPPER EXTREMITY NEURAL PROSTHESES   A common feature of spinal cord injury (SCI) and neurological movement disorders is that the peripheral neuromuscular system remains intact. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) offers the potential to restore movement in these individuals. Impressive improvements in electrode and sensor hardware have recently been made, but development of control algorithms for complex dynamic movements remains difficult.      Reinforcement learning (RL) is a technique from artificial intelligence that has the potential to overcome this problem. A RL-based control system learns from experience how to control movement, in very much the same way as an infant. The system receives information from multiple sensors, as well as a reward signal, and generates actions, i.e. muscle stiimulation levels, that are initially random. The system will learn to predict the consequences of its actions and will ultimately converge to a control strategy that maximizes the sum of rewards over time. An essential feature of RL is that the control strategy is not created by the designer, but is learned from experience. This learning process could ultimately result in motor behavior of much higher quality than can be achieved with traditionally designed feedback control systems, which tend to ""fight"" rather than exploit the natural dynamics of the body such as inertia, pendulum and mass-spring mechanisms. Furthermore, a self learning system has the advantage that it can adapt itself to the user's body mass, muscle strength, as well as variations in electrode location.      The long-term goal is a system that integrates high-level commands from the user with signals from implanted sensors to produce intelligent and adaptive motor function. Feasibility of this concept will be tested here for FES control of six muscles in the upper extremity, to perform the task of reaching in the horizontal plane. The following specific aims are proposed: (1) Implementation of RL control on a virtual arm with computer-generated commands and rewards, (2) RL control on a virtual arm, with commands and rewards given by a human operator, and (3) RL control of muscles in a paralyzed arm in two subjects with high cervical spinal cord injury, with commands and rewards given by the user via a head tracker based input device. n/a",INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF UPPER EXTREMITY NEURAL PROSTHESES,7085349,R21HD049662,"['artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'computer simulation', 'electrodes', 'electrostimulus', 'human subject', 'limb movement', 'nervous system prosthesis', 'neuromuscular disorder', 'neuromuscular stimulator', 'neuroregulation', 'spinal cord injury']",NICHD,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COL/MED-CWRU,R21,2006,192359,0.07326854993118613
"Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop data mining and artificial intelligence systems to recognize the presence and severity of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Such a system would be valuable both for the clinical management of patients as well as for the conduct of trials of new treatments for PD. We hypothesize that movement disorders that accompany late-stage PD will present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from surface electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks.      In the first phase of the project (R21) we will explore motor patterns associated with motor states (OFF, ON, DYSKINETIC). We will design methods that rely on data mining visualization techniques and vector quantization-projection algorithms for the identification of data clusters. Successful accomplishment of this exploratory phase will be followed by an R33 Phase in which we will develop a neuro-fuzzy system to provide clinical scores from automated analysis of the EMG and ACC features. Furthermore, we will perform a thorough analysis of motor pattems expressing the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD using fuzzy ARTMAP techniques. The approach will enable us to integrate clinical information into the quantitative EMG/ACC data analysis for the purpose of increasing our ability to identify the motor patterns associated with these disorders. Finally, Parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations will be monitored before and after adjustment of their medications to assess the sensitivity of the technique to changes in the motor fluctuation patterns.       Although this project focuses on a specific clinical application requiring advanced analysis techniques, the approach can be generalized to numerous applications in which data mining and other methods developed in this project can be used to analyze large data sets recorded using wearable sensors. n/a",Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD,7109222,R21NS045410,"['Parkinson&apos', 's disease', 'abnormal involuntary movement', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'electromyography', 'human subject', 'method development', 'neuromuscular disorder', 'psychomotor function', 'tremor']",NINDS,SPAULDING REHABILITATION HOSPITAL,R21,2006,483334,0.05914447157411443
"Wearable-Sensor System for Monitoring Motor Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a wearable Personal Status Monitor for improving the medication management of Parkinson's Disease patients by monitoring the effects of the medication continuously during the day. New outcome measures are needed to supplement the self-reports currently in use that are ineffective in managing the complex and unpredictable nature of movement disorders in this population. The device we propose to develop can be worn unobtrusively by patients in their home to automatically provide the following clinically significant information: 1) the presence and severity of specific primary and secondary movement disorders associated with the disease, 2) the status of  On-Off motor fluctuation in response to anti-Parkinson's medication, and 3) the mobility status of the patient. The patient will be monitored by specially designed electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometric (ACC) body-worn sensors. Their signals will be analyzed by a novel Artificial Intelligence knowledge-based signal processing method developed by our group specifically for this purpose. Success of the system will be based on classification accuracy compared to observation by experts. The proposal is composed of two projects. The first and dominant project will develop the underlying technological requirements for the PSM system's application to Parkinson's disease. The aims will include acquisition hardware development in the form of hybrid EMG/ACC sensors. However, the emphasis will be on the development of the knowledge-based algorithms and their software implementation.

"Development of a Bidirectional Brain Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have made it possible to move a robotic device in real time, using signals obtained directly from the brain. This field of Brain Machine Interface (BMI) has the means to provide movement for paralyzed patients, communication for locked-in patients, and a better understanding of the brain for all of society. In order to control movement effectively, the brain must be able to activate muscles appropriately, and monitor the evolving movement quickly and precisely. Existing BMIs for, while remarkable, do each of these tasks in poor imitation of the intact nervous system. Our proposed work addresses these limitations by developing a bidirectional interface that produces movement in a more natural way, and provides feedback about the movement by direct, electrical stimulation of the brain. Our partnership includes members at Northwestern Univ (NU), Univ of Chicago (UC), Univ of Mass, Amherst (UMass), and the autonomous Univ of Mexico (UNAM). Partners have advanced degrees in a range of biological science, computer science, physics, mathematics, and engineering disciplines. Miller (NU) will coordinate the partnership.

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7125904,R01MH066990,"['bioinformatics', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'model design /development', 'neural information processing', 'neurophysiology', 'sensory feedback', 'sensory mechanism', 'statistics /biometry']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2006,36891,0.024974572815822434

"FINGER COORDINATION IN ELDERLY Impairment of hand function with age is a major disabling factor limiting many activities of daily living.  A decrease in the hand dexterity may lead to a loss of independence and require external care during most everyday activities.  Our present understanding of the functioning of the human hand and changes in its function with age is limited.  This makes it imperative to perform studies directed at improved understanding of the hand function and its deterioration with age. Series of studies on control subjects and preliminary findings in a small group of elderly subjects have allowed us to formulate two major hypotheses: (a) Aging is associated with selective impairment of intrinsic hand muscles; and (b) Aging is associated with an increase in force deficit during multi-finger tasks.  The following research program has been elaborated for an analysis of possible contribution of these age-related changes to the loss of hand dexterity with age: (1) Confirmation of the preliminary conclusions using a larger subject population and a wider spectrum of tasks; (2) Analysis of the effects of these changes on crucial features of multi-finger synergies such as minimization of secondary moments and patterns of variability of individual finger forces (error compensation among fingers); (3) Analysis of possible changes in finger and hand coordination during more common actions such as gripping and bi-manual object handling; and (4) Analysis of correlations between changes in the indices of finger coordination and activities of daily living that involve hand function. Seven experiments on elderly and control subjects are suggested that include force production by sets of fingers in gripping and pressing tasks, self-imposed perturbations, and bi-manual object handling.

"Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning   DESCRIPTION:(from applicant's abstract):                                                                                                 The long-term goal of this project is to understand the cerebellum well enough       to build a computer simulation that emulates its function. Several fortuitous        features of the cerebellum make it especially amenable to analysis using             large-scale, bottom-up computer simulations. The objectives of these                 simulations is to make our understanding of the cerebellum expressible at the        level of information processing: what the cerebellum processes and how. The          specific aims build on previous work using the particular advantages of              Pavlovian eyelid conditioning to build and test biologically detailed and            accurate computer simulations of the cerebellum. The studies of this project         will follow a two-pronged approach: capabilities of the simulations will be          used as the basis for empirical studies that test underlying mechanisms              predicted by the simulations, shortcomings of the simulations will be used as        the basis for further development of the simulations. Specific hypotheses will       be pursued as to how the addition of specific biological features will               alleviate specific shortcomings. In this way the simulations permit a                systematic structure-function analysis of cerebellar mechanisms that operate         during motor learning. The use of eyelid conditioning as the                         cerebellar-dependent behavior that the simulations must accomplish provides a        rich repertoire of behavioral properties to challenge the simulations and makes      the connections the between the simulations and empirical tests of its               predictions quite tight. The completion of these studies will provide a              relatively clear picture of the basic mechanisms that operate in the cerebellum      during learning and adaptation of movements. This should have important future       implications for those afflicted with cerebellar damage or degenerative              pathologies. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that certain parts of the       human cerebellum are involved in non-motor, cognitive process. Since the             synaptic organization of these regions and those involved in motor learning do       not appear to differ, the cerebellum must contribute the same information            processing to both motor and cognitive tasks. The proposed studies therefore         represent the ability to study information processing of the cerebellum using        quite tractable motor behaviors and then to apply that information to more           complex cognitive processes. Thus, these studies will provide a basic                understanding of information processing for important aspects of the motor           system, and could provide the foundation for a deeper understanding of the           neural basis of information processing that is applied to cognitive properties       as well.                                                                                                                                                                  n/a",Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning,6889075,R01MH057051,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'behavioral extinction', 'biological models', 'brain electronic stimulator', 'cerebellar Purkinje cell', 'cerebellar nuclei', 'cerebellum', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer simulation', 'electrophysiology', 'eye movements', 'laboratory rabbit', 'learning', 'microelectrodes', 'neural information processing', 'neural plasticity', 'neural transmission', 'neurons', 'operant conditionings', 'psychomotor function', 'reflex', 'statistics /biometry', 'stimulus /response', 'synapses']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2005,222750,0.040268429430945434
"Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop data mining and artificial intelligence systems to recognize the presence and severity of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Such a system would be valuable both for the clinical management of patients as well as for the conduct of trials of new treatments for PD. We hypothesize that movement disorders that accompany late-stage PD will present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from surface electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks.      In the first phase of the project (R21) we will explore motor patterns associated with motor states (OFF, ON, DYSKINETIC). We will design methods that rely on data mining visualization techniques and vector quantization-projection algorithms for the identification of data clusters. Successful accomplishment of this exploratory phase will be followed by an R33 Phase in which we will develop a neuro-fuzzy system to provide clinical scores from automated analysis of the EMG and ACC features. Furthermore, we will perform a thorough analysis of motor pattems expressing the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD using fuzzy ARTMAP techniques. The approach will enable us to integrate clinical information into the quantitative EMG/ACC data analysis for the purpose of increasing our ability to identify the motor patterns associated with these disorders. Finally, Parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations will be monitored before and after adjustment of their medications to assess the sensitivity of the technique to changes in the motor fluctuation patterns.       Although this project focuses on a specific clinical application requiring advanced analysis techniques, the approach can be generalized to numerous applications in which data mining and other methods developed in this project can be used to analyze large data sets recorded using wearable sensors. n/a",Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD,6942725,R21NS045410,"['Parkinson&apos', 's disease', 'abnormal involuntary movement', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'electromyography', 'human subject', 'method development', 'neuromuscular disorder', 'psychomotor function', 'tremor']",NINDS,SPAULDING REHABILITATION HOSPITAL,R21,2005,483683,0.05914447157411443
"Development of a Bidirectional Brain Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have made it possible to move a robotic device in real time, using signals obtained directly from the brain. This field of Brain Machine Interface (BMI) has the means to provide movement for paralyzed patients, communication for locked-in patients, and a better understanding of the brain for all of society. In order to control movement effectively, the brain must be able to activate muscles appropriately, and monitor the evolving movement quickly and precisely. Existing BMIs for, while remarkable, do each of these tasks in poor imitation of the intact nervous system. Our proposed work addresses these limitations by developing a bidirectional interface that produces movement in a more natural way, and provides feedback about the movement by direct, electrical stimulation of the brain. Our partnership includes members at Northwestern Univ (NU), Univ of Chicago (UC), Univ of Mass, Amherst (UMass), and the autonomous Univ of Mexico (UNAM). Partners have advanced degrees in a range of biological science, computer science, physics, mathematics, and engineering disciplines. Miller (NU) will coordinate the partnership. He has extensive experience with a wide range of recording, stimulation and behavioral protocols in behaving monkeys. Hatsopoulos (UC) is at the forefront of the field of multi-electrode recordings. He was a leading member of the first group to demonstrate visually guided BMI control by a primate. Barto (U Mass) has done pioneering research in neural networks, machine learning and stochastic optimization. Fagg (UMass) is an authority in the control of reaching and grasping robots that learn to interact with the environment. Together they will develop the decoders of activity from the brain used to cause movement. Romo (UNAM), is a world leader in studies of the perceptual and decision making processes induced by electrical stimulation of the brain. Solla (NU) is an expert in neural networks and information theory. With Romo, she will develop optimal routines to encode information in stimulus trains to provide feedback to the brain.

Although the current system         has been a valuable research tool, it has never been useful as a clinical tool       due to limitations in processing time, accuracy and portability.

The laboratory studies will investigate the modifications          that occur in the firing of motor units as a function of ageing and will             quantify the benefits that can be restored by exercise. The system will also be      used to investigate the phenomena of motor unit substitution.

"Spinal Cord Injury: Automatic Scoring of Motor Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disorders of motor function due to accidental injury, stroke and neurodegenerative disorders, together with disorders of mental health, are the most crippling human ailments. One common result of mechanical insult is spinal cord injury (SCI), in which damage of the spinal cord by contusion, compression or laceration causes loss of sensation, motor and reflex function below the point of injury. Other symptoms of SCI may include bowel and bladder dysfunction, hyperalgesia and sexual dysfunction. Although many SCI patients survive injury, major chronic dysfunction is the most common outcome. There are approximately 10,000 new cases of spinal cord injury (SCI) in the U.S each year. In contrast to the relatively small acute patient population, chronic SCI, involving approximately 200,000-250,000 people in this country, is extremely expensive to society, both in terms of human and economic costs. Because most SCI victims are under age 30 at the time of their injury, and most now live a near-normal life span, direct medical costs average $2 million per patient over a lifetime, and approximately $5 billion total per year in the US only. Therefore, any   drug or intervention that can positively improve the quality of life of patients suffering from SCI is likely to have a greater financial impact than would be expected simply from the cost of acute injury each year.  Animal models for SCI and other conditions that affect gait and motor coordination are successfully used today to develop new treatments. Assessing the level of motor dysfunction in an animal model is a difficult challenge as most researchers rely on the subjective scoring of symptoms. We propose here to build a system that will allow a more objective, faster and consistent assessment of the level of injury and course of recovery in rat and mouse models of SCI that can be applied in the future to other gait and motor coordination disorders. An artificial intelligent system based on computer vision will be developed to capture and score gait and motor coordination in rodents and will be validated against the standard scores of motor function obtained using the methods of Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (1995) for the rat model of SCI.         n/a",Spinal Cord Injury: Automatic Scoring of Motor Function,6695163,R43NS046980,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' gait', ' laboratory rat', ' limb movement', ' psychomotor function', ' spinal cord injury']",NINDS,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2003,234554,0.04049104428928111

"Neurological Control During Brain Recording  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research proposal aims to investigate the optimal design features of intracortical motor neuroprosthetics by analyzing: 1) The ability of specific algorithms to predict movements from neural activity, 2) the ability of non-human primate subjects to control neurally-derived signals in a behaviorally useful way, and 3) explore the abilities of humans to control computer cursors with neural activity. First, discrete and continuous movement models will be evaluated to determine the minimum amount of data necessary to build robust decoders. This relates to clinical calibration: How much time will be required for patients to build decoding models that they can then use? Next, I will evaluate if and how animals can control a computer cursor whose position is driven by decoded neural activity alone: Whether they can generate stationary holds, ballistic reaches, and complex trajectories. Finally, I will test the decoding system in humans by participating in ongoing human multi-electrode recording. I hope to implement a real-time neural activity decoding system to test whether human subjects can rapidly acquire useful, accurate control over a movement signal. These investigations will shed light on which parameters are useful for achieving such control and yield insight on the optimal balance between computer and human learning in the closed-loop control system to restore maximum functional independence.   n/a",Neurological Control During Brain Recording,6583494,F31NS045460,"['Macaca', ' artificial intelligence', ' assistive device /technology', ' behavior test', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' biomechanics', ' clinical research', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' electrodes', ' functional ability', ' goal oriented behavior', ' human subject', ' mathematical model', ' medical rehabilitation related tag', ' nervous system prosthesis', ' neurophysiology', ' neuroregulation', ' predoctoral investigator']",NINDS,BROWN UNIVERSITY,F31,2003,37017,0.06580802324651222
"Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning   DESCRIPTION:(from applicant's abstract):                                                                                                 The long-term goal of this project is to understand the cerebellum well enough       to build a computer simulation that emulates its function. Several fortuitous        features of the cerebellum make it especially amenable to analysis using             large-scale, bottom-up computer simulations. The objectives of these                 simulations is to make our understanding of the cerebellum expressible at the        level of information processing: what the cerebellum processes and how. The          specific aims build on previous work using the particular advantages of              Pavlovian eyelid conditioning to build and test biologically detailed and            accurate computer simulations of the cerebellum. The studies of this project         will follow a two-pronged approach: capabilities of the simulations will be          used as the basis for empirical studies that test underlying mechanisms              predicted by the simulations, shortcomings of the simulations will be used as        the basis for further development of the simulations. Specific hypotheses will       be pursued as to how the addition of specific biological features will               alleviate specific shortcomings. In this way the simulations permit a                systematic structure-function analysis of cerebellar mechanisms that operate         during motor learning. The use of eyelid conditioning as the                         cerebellar-dependent behavior that the simulations must accomplish provides a        rich repertoire of behavioral properties to challenge the simulations and makes      the connections the between the simulations and empirical tests of its               predictions quite tight. The completion of these studies will provide a              relatively clear picture of the basic mechanisms that operate in the cerebellum      during learning and adaptation of movements. This should have important future       implications for those afflicted with cerebellar damage or degenerative              pathologies. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that certain parts of the       human cerebellum are involved in non-motor, cognitive process. Since the             synaptic organization of these regions and those involved in motor learning do       not appear to differ, the cerebellum must contribute the same information            processing to both motor and cognitive tasks. The proposed studies therefore         represent the ability to study information processing of the cerebellum using        quite tractable motor behaviors and then to apply that information to more           complex cognitive processes. Thus, these studies will provide a basic                understanding of information processing for important aspects of the motor           system, and could provide the foundation for a deeper understanding of the           neural basis of information processing that is applied to cognitive properties       as well.                                                                                                                                                                  n/a",Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning,6639065,R01MH057051,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' behavioral extinction', ' biological models', ' brain electronic stimulator', ' cerebellar Purkinje cell', ' cerebellar nuclei', ' cerebellum', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' electrophysiology', ' eye movements', ' laboratory rabbit', ' learning', ' microelectrodes', ' neural information processing', ' neural plasticity', ' neural transmission', ' neurons', ' operant conditionings', ' psychomotor function', ' reflex', ' statistics /biometry', ' stimulus /response', ' synapses']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2003,223063,0.040268429430945434
"Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop data mining and artificial intelligence systems to recognize the presence and severity of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Such a system would be valuable both for the clinical management of patients as well as for the conduct of trials of new treatments for PD. We hypothesize that movement disorders that accompany late-stage PD will present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from surface electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks.      In the first phase of the project (R21) we will explore motor patterns associated with motor states (OFF, ON, DYSKINETIC). We will design methods that rely on data mining visualization techniques and vector quantization-projection algorithms for the identification of data clusters. Successful accomplishment of this exploratory phase will be followed by an R33 Phase in which we will develop a neuro-fuzzy system to provide clinical scores from automated analysis of the EMG and ACC features. Furthermore, we will perform a thorough analysis of motor pattems expressing the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD using fuzzy ARTMAP techniques. The approach will enable us to integrate clinical information into the quantitative EMG/ACC data analysis for the purpose of increasing our ability to identify the motor patterns associated with these disorders. Finally, Parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations will be monitored before and after adjustment of their medications to assess the sensitivity of the technique to changes in the motor fluctuation patterns.       Although this project focuses on a specific clinical application requiring advanced analysis techniques, the approach can be generalized to numerous applications in which data mining and other methods developed in this project can be used to analyze large data sets recorded using wearable sensors. n/a",Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD,6688775,R21NS045410,"[""Parkinson's disease"", ' abnormal involuntary movement', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' electromyography', ' human subject', ' method development', ' neuromuscular disorder', ' psychomotor function', ' tremor']",NINDS,SPAULDING REHABILITATION HOSPITAL,R21,2003,178485,0.05914447157411443

The system will be an enhancement of a current      system used over the past 20 years in many studies carried out by the                Neuromuscular Research Lab at Boston University. Although the current system         has been a valuable research tool, it has never been useful as a clinical tool       due to limitations in processing time, accuracy and portability.

"FINGER COORDINATION IN ELDERLY Impairment of hand function with age is a major disabling factor limiting many activities of daily living.  A decrease in the hand dexterity may lead to a loss of independence and require external care during most everyday activities.  Our present understanding of the functioning of the human hand and changes in its function with age is limited.  This makes it imperative to perform studies directed at improved understanding of the hand function and its deterioration with age. Series of studies on control subjects and preliminary findings in a small group of elderly subjects have allowed us to formulate two major hypotheses: (a) Aging is associated with selective impairment of intrinsic hand muscles; and (b) Aging is associated with an increase in force deficit during multi-finger tasks.  The following research program has been elaborated for an analysis of possible contribution of these age-related changes to the loss of hand dexterity with age: (1) Confirmation of the preliminary conclusions using a larger subject population and a wider spectrum of tasks; (2) Analysis of the effects of these changes on crucial features of multi-finger synergies such as minimization of secondary moments and patterns of variability of individual finger forces (error compensation among fingers); (3) Analysis of possible changes in finger and hand coordination during more common actions such as gripping and bi-manual object handling; and (4) Analysis of correlations between changes in the indices of finger coordination and activities of daily living that involve hand function. Seven experiments on elderly and control subjects are suggested that include force production by sets of fingers in gripping and pressing tasks, self-imposed perturbations, and bi-manual object handling.

In one experiment, the results will be compared with indices of the activities of daily living. Disprovable predictions are made for each experiment.

"MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Purpose/Hypothesis: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes substantial social, economic, and health burden.1 For individuals with motor incomplete SCI, some basic ability to stand or walk is expected during the recovery process,2 and this is a top priority in rehabilitative programs.3 However, establishing a prognosis for recovering community walking ability is extremely difficult.4 Within 72 hours after SCI,5 edema develops within the damaged spinal cord. This edema is a hallmark of spinal cord injury, expressed as signal hyperintensity using T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).6 Correlations between the sagittal length of this spinal cord edema and walking ability are generally poor.7,8 However, advanced but available high resolution axial T2-weighted MRI to quantify spinal cord edema in people in the acute stage of SCI may improve prediction of walking ability.9,10 The early clinical management and targeted rehabilitation of these individuals could be drastically enhanced, optimizing recovery and rehabilitation outcomes. The main objective of this research project is to use early axial spinal cord MRI sequences as neuroprognostic biomarkers to improve the prediction of residual motor function. This objective will be realized by the implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish to what extent the axial damage ratio biomarker, measured by high-resolution axial T2-weighted structural imaging, can predict residual function in persons with SCI. Previously-collected axial T2-weighted spinal cord structural MRI data of 200 people with SCI from the US Model SCI System at Craig Hospital will be used to quantify cord damage. This metric will be related to the primary 1-year status-post injury outcome measures, which are clinical records of walking ability and function. Multivariate statistical analyses will be applied to create exploratory models to determine the prognostic value of the MRI measures. We hypothesize that the axial damage ratio can be used in the acute stage as an accurate and objective neuroprognostic biomarker of residual motor function. Aim 2: To identify the relationship between damage to specific spinal cord regions and specific motor and sensory deficits. MRI data from Aim 1 will be used. Spinal cord regional damage analysis will be related to right and left upper and lower extremity motor and sensory scores. Correlational statistical analyses will be applied to analyze relationships between specific tract damage and motor/sensory deficits. We hypothesize that damage to descending lateral corticospinal motor regions is related to ipsilesional motor deficits, and that similar findings exist for ascending sensory regions and sensory deficits. For both Aims, we will compare our manual damage quantification to our machine learning approach to automatically detect spinal cord damage. Aim 3: Develop, test, and distribute a machine-learning based analysis pipeline for spinal cord damage measures. We will use functions included in the Spinal Cord Toolbox and the open-source NiftyNet deep-learning platform to develop the machine-learning based analysis pipeline. The processing steps will include spinal cord detection, spinal cord damage segmentation, registration to the spinal cord template, and the calculation and output of the axial damage ratio and regional damage biomarkers. Significance: Successful completion of these Aims will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” The significance of this outcome relates directly to improving the clinical management of SCI. This research may inform clinicians, patients, and families, regarding the percentage chance of regaining walking ability. The healthcare team will be able to determine, early-on, which people will optimally respond to locomotor training. This work will significantly improve the prognosis for recovery of walking and specific motor/sensory function based on early imaging of the damaged spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this research project is to use early axial MRI measures of spinal cord damage as objective biomarkers to improve the prediction of walking recovery and specific motor return of individuals following SCI. This research will provide patients with a quantified sense of expectations regarding their chances of walking recovery, and will help guide the healthcare team on the best options for clinical management and rehabilitation (i.e. focusing on neuroplasticity and restoration of walking versus compensatory strategies).

"Touching on locomotion: an anatomical and functional analysis of spinal cord circuits that shape the way we move Project Summary/Abstract A central challenge in neuroscience biomedical research is to define the neural circuits that underlie behavior. Investigations of spinal cord circuits are ideally suited to answer these questions: the direct link between sensory input and motor output affords an exquisite experimental tractability that has been leveraged since Sherrington’s pioneering work on the proprioceptive reflex pathway1. Indeed, great progress has been made since then in understanding how proprioceptors (i.e., muscle sensory neurons) shape motor activity. Touch receptors in skin (i.e., cutaneous sensory neurons) encoding sensory modalities like vibration, indentation, and slip, are also critical for adapting the way we walk in response to changes in our environment. However, spinal cord integration of touch pathways that sculpt motor activity remains profoundly poorly understood. To address key conceptual and technical challenges in this field, we have built an extensive mouse genetic toolbox to visualize, quantify and manipulate touch-specific spinal cord circuits. In addition, we merge these powerful genetic tools with motor assays involving high-speed cameras, computer vision, and machine learning to quantify somatosensory behavior with unprecedented sensitivity. Combining these technologies, we identified a novel touch-specific premotor network important for sensorimotor function. Our overall hypothesis is that this network represents a critical node for integrating touch information to influence specific patterns of muscle groups that facilitate both corrective movements during locomotion and motor ‘switching’ during naturalistic behaviors. We interrogate this novel network to address fundamental questions whose answers will enable a deeper understanding of how touch pathways converge in the spinal cord to shape movement. In Aims 1 and 2 we combine genetic approaches, high-resolution synaptic analysis, slice electrophysiology and in-vivo muscle recordings to test the hypothesis that this network integrates multimodal sensory information to coordinate specific muscles in response to cutaneous input. Aim 3 combines joint and muscle activity recordings to test the hypothesis that this network shapes cutaneous responses to facilitate corrective movements during locomotion. We extend these behavioral studies by implementing computer vision and machine learning to parse out naturalistic behaviors into sub- second movements to test the hypothesis that touch-specific premotor networks sculpt how micro-movements are pieced together into complex motor behaviors . By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research will lead to new therapies aimed at improving the quality of life of people suffering from a variety of neurological disorders. Thus, this research lays the critical foundation for novel ways to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function. Project Narrative Our movements are shaped by sensory information, and though much progress has been made in understanding how proprioceptors (muscle sensory neurons) shape motor function, much less is known about how touch receptors (skin sensory neurons) influence motor pathways. To generate a complete picture of how sensory information affects motor actions, this project incorporates a multidisciplinary approach to provide a functional roadmap of how skin touch receptors interact with spinal cord motor centers to shape movement. By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research lays the critical foundation for novel ways to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function affected by disease or injury.",Touching on locomotion: an anatomical and functional analysis of spinal cord circuits that shape the way we move,10094597,R01NS119268,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Anatomy', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Extensor', 'Flexor', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Hindlimb', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lateral', 'Length', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor Pathways', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Proprioceptor', 'Quality of life', 'Reflex action', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sensorimotor functions', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Skin', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord posterior horn', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Walking', 'Work', 'behavioral study', 'cutaneous sensory neurons', 'electrical property', 'genetic approach', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'motor behavior', 'motor function improvement', 'mouse genetics', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'vibration']",NINDS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2020,433281,0.0566733158381029
"Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of this R01 project is to develop an automated assessment system that can capitalize on state of the art sensing technologies and machine learning algorithms to enable accurate and early detection of infants at risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities. In the USA, 1 in 10 infants are born at risk for these disabilities. For children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, early treatment in the first year of life improves long-term outcomes. However, we are currently held back by inadequacies of available clinical tests to measure and predict impairment. Existing tests are hard to administer, require specialized training, and have limited long- term predictive value. There is a critical need to develop an objective, accurate, easy-to-use tool for the early prediction of long-term physical disability. The field of pediatrics and infant development would greatly benefit from a quantitative score that would correlate with existing clinical measures used today to detect movement impairments in very young infants. To realize a new generation of tests that will be easy to administer, we will obtain large datasets of infants playing in an instrumented gym or simply being recorded while moving in a supine posture. Video and sensor data analyses will convert movement into feature vectors based on our knowledge of the problem domain. Our approach will use machine learning to relate these feature vectors to currently recommended clinical tests or other ground truth information. The power of this design is that algorithms can utilize many aspects of movement to produce the relevant scores. Our preliminary data allows us to lay the following aims: 1)Aim 1: To assess concurrent validity of a multimodal instrumented gym with existing clinical tools. Here, using 150 infants (75 with early brain injury and 75 controls), we will focus on converting data from an instrumented gym into estimates of the standard clinical tests; 2)Aim 2: To develop a computer vision-based algorithm to quantify infant motor performance from single camera video. Here using video data from 1200 infants (400 with early brain injury, 400 preterm without early brain injury, 400 controls), plus those gathered from Aim 1 and Aim 3, we will extract pose data from single-camera video recordings and convert these into kinematic features and relevant scores needed to classify infant movement; 3)Aim3: To discover the features related to long-term motor development. Here we will convert data collected longitudinally from 50 infants (25 with early brain injury and 25 controls) using both instrumented gym and video recordings into estimates standard clinical tests change over time and track features over developmental timescales. These three aims spearhead the use of real world behavior for movement scoring. Our aims will bring us closer to a universal non-invasive test for early detection of neurodevelopmental disabilities and lay the groundwork for long-term prediction of disability. But above all, it promises to scale to infants worldwide, producing an affordable tool to aid in infant health assessment. NARRATIVE Increased survival rates of medically fragile infants lead to an increased number of children with functional impairments later in life. Early detection of motor delays or impairments provides the opportunity for early treatment which improves health outcomes. This study will use state of the art sensors combined with machine learning approaches to develop objective, accurate, easy-to-use tools for the early scoring of deficits and lays the foundation for the early prediction of physical disability.",Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability,9993993,R01HD097686,"['Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Asphyxia', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Birth History', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Educational Status', 'Effectiveness', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand Strength', 'Health', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Infant Health', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Predictive Value', 'Premature Birth', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Seizures', 'Supination', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toy', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'base', 'critical period', 'design', 'disability', 'drug abuse in pregnancy', 'early screening', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'infant monitoring', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'multimodality', 'neonatal stroke', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel strategies', 'physically handicapped', 'pressure', 'prognostic tool', 'recruit', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skeletal', 'tool', 'vector']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,670354,-0.013172249093816549
"Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of tetraplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop methods to artificially activate and control paralyzed muscles with electrodes implanted in muscles.

"Characterizing the structure of motor cortex activity across multiple behaviors for improved brain-machine interfaces Project Abstract. Candidate and career goals: I am an engineer by training, with a strong background in neural engineering and the development of motor brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). My career goal is to establish an independent nonhuman primate (NHP) laboratory with two primary aims. First, I will advance our fundamental understanding of the motor system via the combination of electrophysiology with novel statistical and computational methods. Second, I will leverage this knowledge to develop frameworks for superior BMI systems.  Throughout my academic and research career I have developed expertise in engineering, computation, and neuroscience with the goal of pursuing these aims. Advances in machine learning, large-scale neural recordings, and deep learning in neural networks are happening quickly (in part via the BRAIN Initiative), and are very promising for the field. Yet very few researchers have the correct combination of skills to make use of them in my areas of interest. In completing the proposed training, I will be uniquely positioned to perform the innovative work necessary to advance our understanding of the planning and execution of cortically controlled movements. I will train the next generation of scientists and engineers in the experimental and computational methods necessary to understand fundamental principles of cortical computations.  Research plan: In this project, I will employ multiple computational approaches to understand the structure of population activity in motor cortex (M1) across multiple kinds of behaviors. I will then use that knowledge to create high performance BMI decoders that will be applicable to a wide range of movements.  Recent empirical observations are changing our view of the structure of M1 activity. During one particular task (e.g., reaching), neural activity may seem to exist within a small space that it explores completely. Yet as more tasks are observed, it becomes clear that activity comprises a highly structured geometry within a much larger space. This means that activity patters for different movements do not come ‘near’ one another or overlap. While counterintuitive, this geometry yields new opportunities. By exploiting the separation of activity patterns, movements can be readily distinguished, even when unfolding simultaneously. I will further explore this geometry across multiple behaviors, both in primates and neural network models, to develop new BMI methods. The specific aims of the plan are to (1) create a high-performance decoder for a novel wheelchair-relevant navigation task, (2) build network models to understand M1 activity structure and identify decoding principles that will generalize across tasks (reaching, navigation), and (3) implement a multitask BMI using a unified decoder that allows animals to both navigate and interact with objects. Career development plan: I will be trained by Dr. Mark Churchland and Dr. Larry Abbott at Columbia University. Project Narrative Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) interpret brain activity to control external devices (computers, prosthetic limbs), and can restore voluntary movement to individuals with limb loss or paralysis. BMIs for reaching and grasping have been demonstrated in human clinical trials, and must now be extended to perform a variety of movements. The proposed work will use advanced computational methods to create an intuitively controllable and high performance BMI system applicable to many natural movements, including locomotion. This work will both develop neurotechnology, and add to our scientific understanding of the computational principles that underlie activity in motor cortex.",Characterizing the structure of motor cortex activity across multiple behaviors for improved brain-machine interfaces,9952827,K99NS115919,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Animals', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biomimetics', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Devices', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Paralysed', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'career development', 'combat', 'computational neuroscience', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'meetings', 'mind control', 'multitask', 'network models', 'neural network', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotechnology', 'next generation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'simulation', 'skills', 'theories', 'virtual', 'virtual reality environment', 'virtual world']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2020,136242,0.058611925517892245
"Next generation brain-machine interfaces controlled synergistically with artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY Over 5 million people in the USA – nearly 1 person in 50 – live with a form of paralysis due to causes including stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and ALS. People who have lost the ability to move also lose a profound sense of control, freedom, and independence in their lives. But paralysis does not take away one's intent or desire to move; the brain still encodes these thoughts through neural signals. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to restore the ability to communicate with the world by translating these neural signals into actions. BMIs decode neural signals into the movements of a computer cursor on a screen or a robotic arm, allowing the user to interact with the world autonomously. While BMIs have existed for over two decades, they have remained in pilot clinical trials dating back to 2004 and have not achieved widespread use. The key reason for this is that BMI performance has not achieved levels of performance that overcome their costs and risks. This is true for both invasive BMIs requiring neurosurgery, as well as for non-invasive BMIs, which can be used without surgical procedures but achieve low performance. This proposal aims to dramatically increase the quality of life for millions with paralysis by making widely accessi- ble BMIs available within the next ﬁve years. To achieve this groundbreaking goal, there needs to be a paradigm shift in the way BMIs fundamentally operate. Revolutionary next generation BMIs making signiﬁcant impact must be designed to: (1) achieve categorically unprecedented performance not possible with current BMI systems (e.g., over an order of magnitude improvement) and (2) minimize cost to patients, ideally being non-invasive. En- tirely novel BMI architectures are needed to fundamentally transcend a performance vs cost trade-off, achieving excellent performance at lower risks and costs. To meet this need, I propose to develop a next-generation BMI where the user and an artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) agent synergistically cooperate. We term this an “AI-BMI.” The AI agent predicts the user's intended motor actions and synergistically helps to complete them. Critically, the AI agent aids the precise and detailed execution of the user's intended movements, augmenting performance. By doing so, this architecture fundamentally changes the design objectives of BMIs from neural decoding of precise movements (difﬁcult) to behavioral and neural inference of the user's intent (easier). Non-invasive AI-BMIs, if successful, would be transformative, enabling next generation BMI technology that allows people with paralysis to once again move, but mitigates medical risks associated with neurosurgery and lowers system costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE For people who have lost the ability to move due to movement disorders, including paralysis and ALS, brain- mahince interfaces (BMIs) aim to restore movement and communication by decoding neural activity from motor regions of the brain to control prosthetic devices. The proposed work aims to create and optimize a new class of transformative BMIs that incorporate an external artiﬁcial intelligence agent who infers the user's intent and helps to carry out prosthesis actions. If successful, these new BMIs would signiﬁcantly increase BMI performance while lowering risks and costs, enabling widespread use.",Next generation brain-machine interfaces controlled synergistically with artificial intelligence,10003004,DP2NS122037,"['Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Medical', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Prosthesis', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Thinking', 'Transcend', 'Translating', 'Work', 'arm', 'brain machine interface', 'cost', 'design', 'intelligent agent', 'neurosurgery', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prosthesis control', 'relating to nervous system']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,DP2,2020,2340000,0.05170042887016526
"Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors Project Summary Behavior is movement, and the effective and efficient execution of movement has served as a fundamental evolutionary force shaping the form and function of the nervous system. Control of the forelimbs to interact with the world is one of the most essential achievements of the mammalian motor system, yet unfortunately these behaviors are particularly vulnerable to disease and injury. The execution of skilled limb movements requires the continuous refinement of motor output across dozens of muscles, suggesting the existence of feedback pathways that enable rapid adjustments. The temporal delays of peripheral pathways, however, suggest that sensory feedback alone cannot explain the sophistication of online motor control. In principle, a more rapid source of feedback would be to convey copies of motor commands internally to the cerebellum to generate predictions of motor outcome, reducing dependence on delayed sensory information. Yet putative copy circuits have been difficult to isolate experimentally, leaving their contributions to movement unclear. Mouse genetic tools offer a means to explore a diverse class of spinal interneurons as a neural substrate for internal copies. Cervical propriospinal neurons (PNs) receive descending motor command input and extend bifurcating axons; one branch projects to forelimb motor neurons and the other projects to the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN), a major cerebellar input, providing an anatomically straightforward means to convey motor copies internally. Yet how diverse classes of PN-LRN circuits are organized and how they each contribute to distinct elements of limb behavior remain unclear. Complicating the problem, the field lacks robust ways for deconstructing complex limb movements into component elements (e.g. reaching, grasping, postural control), and objective means for quantifying these behaviors in mice. Hypothesis: Discrete classes of PN circuits convey distinct types of spinal motor copy information to the LRN, each necessary for separate aspects of forelimb control; this functional logic can be resolved with more quantitative, high-resolution and standardized behavioral assays. To test this overarching hypothesis, Aim 1 uses molecular-genetic circuit mapping approaches and single-cell RNA- sequencing to define the anatomical and molecular organization of four classes of PN-LRN circuits. Identifying the fine-grained structure of these diverse pathways will be essential for establishing how internal copies are conveyed to the cerebellum to control forelimb behavior. Aim 2 addresses the need for more sensitive and unbiased behavioral tools by developing novel assays of discrete elements of forelimb behavior and machine learning approaches for automated quantification of forelimb kinematics. Finally, Aim 3 merges these novel behavioral approaches with intersectional genetic tools, electrophysiological recording and circuit-specific perturbation to functionally dissect PN-LRN circuits and define their modular contributions to dexterous limb control. Ultimately, these studies will yield insight into the function of internal copy circuits throughout the nervous system, and help to lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits. Project Narrative In addition to promoting basic science investigation of motor function, this work can impact the study of motor dysfunction. Skilled movements of the arm and hand are particularly susceptible to disease and injury of the motor system, raising the need for a better understanding of motor circuit organization and more informative strategies for studying the behaviors these circuits control. Merging molecular-genetic tools with novel behavioral approaches will offer a more detailed and comprehensive approach to studying movement, helping to provide greater insight into the neural basis of motor deficits as well as more effective ways to restore or replace lost motor function.","Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors",9984552,R01NS111479,"['Ablation', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Axon', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebellum', 'Cervical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Forelimb', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Limb structure', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Postural adjustments', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Rabies', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Viral', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'molecular subtypes', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'mouse genetics', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory feedback', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,R01,2020,579461,0.052866838994836685
"An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers Motor development plays a pivotal role in an infant’s overall development and has a cascading effect on social, cognitive, memory, and language ability. These functions can be compromised when motor development is disrupted; motor disruption is associated with generalized developmental delays. Early screening and identification of delays can allow early interventions with the goal of not just improving motor function but overall development in other domains. Experience with independent or motorized crawling is shown to improve spatial memory in infants. Active motor training, even as early as 3 months, is shown to achieve gains in object exploration and social engagement that persist long after the training sessions, indicating the benefits of early intervention. Children who get developmental screening are more likely to be identified with delays and receive early intervention services compared to those that only receive age-appropriate milestone checks as part of pediatric well-child visits. However, comprehensive motor screening, using standardized instruments, for developmental surveillance is labor intensive and requires specialized training in administration and evaluation. Shortage of resources to perform frequent, gold-standard, comprehensive motor assessments can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and contribute negatively to lifelong outcomes for infants at risk for behavioral and developmental disorders. In the US, 15-20% of children have a developmental or behavioral disability, but less than a third of them get diagnosed before entering school, preventing opportunities for early intervention during a critical period of brain development. In Phase I, we built a prototype Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) to automate extraction of infant motor movement from video; then utilized this engine to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated developmental risk screener by leveraging recent advances in machine learning to achieve state of the art accuracies in assessment of infant motor development. In Phase II, we aim to build out the risk screener, SCOREIT, as a clinically deployable, cost-effective, developmental risk assessment tool to identify children who need further clinical follow-up. SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental screening by bringing the power of comprehensive motor screening, usually administered only to at-risk children utilizing specialized resources, to underserved and economically-fragile communities. Less than a third of US children receive developmental screening. SCOREIT can bring risk screenings to the over 70% of children that currently do not receive them, increasing opportunities for early intervention for behavioral and developmental disorders. Additionally, the HARE system’s ability to automatically extract and quantify motor movements from video can be an enabler for explorations of early markers for behavioral and developmental disorders, significantly easing manual video coding burdens and accelerating the pace of discoveries. This proposal introduces an automated, portable, low-cost developmental risk assessment tool, SCOREIT, that leverages advances in machine learning to extract motor movements from infant videos and generate a motor developmental score based on a standardized instrument (Alberta Infant Motor Scale; AIMS). SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental risk screening by bringing the power of standardized, comprehensive motor screening to underserved, economically-fragile communities, and increase opportunities for early intervention of developmental disorders.",An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers,9785611,R44HD095783,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alberta province', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Coordination Disorders', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Parents', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Supination', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'early screening', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning network', 'motor function improvement', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'social', 'social engagement', 'spatial memory', 'tool']",NICHD,"BSOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2020,601447,0.009147594537854261
"An Intracortical Brain-Computer Interface Model for High Efficiency Development of Closed-Loop Neural Decoding Algorithms An intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) is used to record electrical signals directly from a person's brain, predict their intention from those signals, then control an assistive device (e.g., a computer cursor, prosthetic limb, or powered wheelchair) according to those intentions. This technology enables severely paralyzed people to interact with the world. However, designing robust algorithms to extract intent from recordings of single neurons is extremely challenging, in large part because of the very limited access to humans, or even monkeys, from whom these invasive recordings can be made. In this project, we will develop a model iBCI system that generates real-time biomimetic neural data by capturing the high-degree-of-freedom finger movements of able-bodied human subjects. To accomplish this, we will construct a modular recurrent neural network (RNN). The RNN will be trained to predict the motor cortex activity of a monkey from the monkey's own finger kinematics. Small modules of the RNN will be interchanged according the particular animal or recording session to model the high inter-session variability present in motor cortex. Once the modular RNN is trained, its weights will be fixed and human finger kinematics will be used as the RNN inputs, which will generate subject-controlled emulated neural activity. The emulated neural activity can be passed to iBCI decoding algorithms that control computer cursors or other physical devices, allowing human subjects to interact directly with decoders in real time, closed-loop conditions. We call this model system the jaBCI. The jaBCI is low cost and noninvasive, making it possible to rapidly test and design novel iBCI decoders using statistically rigorous sample sizes. The project will be executed in close collaboration with intracortical microelectrode array data expert Dr. Lee Miller at Northwestern University. Dr. Miller's lab, with the help of our consultant Dr. Mathis, will obtain simultaneous finger kinematics and neural activity of monkey subjects that will serve as the training data for the RNN component of the iBCI model. We will validate the emulated neural data generated by the jaBCI across many measures to ensure the model captures as many features of intracortical data as possible. These include comparing the model and actual iBCI in subject performance, learning rates, control strategies, neural variation across days, neural firing rate distributions, and low-dimensional neural dynamics. With the validated model, we will undertake a study to rigorously evaluate the highest performing, current state-of-the-art iBCI decoders. This will yield useful insight into the features of decoders that yield the greatest performance gains, overcoming the current impossibility to compare iBCI decoders in well-controlled studies using more than two or three naïve human subjects. We will also use the iBCI model to evaluate novel decoder designs, and to determine the features of neural dynamics that are consistent across common iBCI tasks to help focus decoder development on those features. Narrative Brain-computer interfaces are systems that translate the electrical neural signatures of thought into instructions for a personal computer or powered wheelchair, which is an incredibly useful technology to help paralyzed people regain some independence and ability to communicate. This work would develop a tool that scientists can use to design, test, and optimize the sophisticated computer programs that translate brain signals into device instructions without having to implant electrodes into a person's brain until the program is completed and rigorously tested.

"Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila The goal of this project is to study the cellular basis of active sensation. A crucial function of all nervous systems is to distinguish between sensory stimuli originating from the external world and that generated by our own movements. This task relies on brain circuits that integrate sensory information with an internal model, or expectation, of self-generated movements. The complexity and intractability of many models used to study active sensing means that translating insights from these studies to failures of normal nervous system function remains challenging. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) actively move their antennae, and my recent work has elucidated a neural circuit that processes mechanosensory information from the antenna. Given the power of Drosophila as a genetic model organism, this project aims to develop the neural circuits controlling and sensing antennal movement as a cellular model for studying principles of active sensing. In the K99 (mentored) portion of this grant, I will identify the cellular location at which self- versus externally-generated mechanosensory signals become differentially represented in the brain. I will make electrophysiological recordings of intracellular activity from 2nd and 3rd order mechanosensory neurons and compare how these two populations encode passive and active movements of the antennae. I will distinguish between these two types of movements using machine learning analysis of simultaneously recorded video data. For the R00 (independent) phase, I will use optogenetics and immunohistochemistry to identify motor neurons that control antennal movement. I will then ask where input from motor neurons impinge on the sensory circuit. Finally, I will test the role of active antennal movements in behavior. By perturbing active antennal movements in freely walking and flying flies, I will directly test how these movements enable different behavioral tasks such as wind orientation and obstacle avoidance. Together, these experiments will identify the cellular basis for active sensing in Drosophila, and their role in goal- oriented behaviors. The goal of the proposed research is to understand the principles that permit nervous systems to distinguish external from internally-generated sensory stimuli. Here I propose to develop a small circuit model of this process using the antennal mechanosensory system of the fruit fly. The insights gained from a tractable genetic circuit model will enable us to understand how these mechanisms fail in disease, supporting the BRAIN Initiative’s mission to understand the neural circuit basis of a critical brain function.",Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila,10012952,K99NS114179,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Closure by clamp', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environmental Wind', 'Esthesia', 'Failure', 'Fingers', 'Flying body movement', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Insecta', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanoreceptors', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Odors', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Stimulus', 'Study models', 'System', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Walking', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'goal oriented behavior', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensory stimulus', 'tool']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2020,134007,0.012319520212556272
"A new mechanistic and technological framework for uncovering the spinal cord neural systems important for functional recovery after injury Project Summary and Abstract Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI) are improving, but little is known about the neural systems that would be most effective to target such interventions. Sensory based rehabilitation suggests a strong link between cutaneous and proprioceptive sensory neuron activity and motor recovery. Previous experiments provide strong support for the intermediate zone (IZ) of the spinal cord (SC) as an important site mediating this recovery. However, few studies have assessed the role of specific IZ neurons in functional recovery. Key barriers to progress include lack of characterization of specific cell types within the IZ and a paucity of tools to visualize circuits and test their functions in motor performance and recovery following SCI. Our lab combines sophisticated mouse genetic approaches with sensitive motor movement tracking to understand how sensory information is encoded by the SC to influence behavior. Using this approach, we uncovered that intermediate zone (IZ) parvalbumin positive interneurons (PVs) are important for tactile motor responses and locomotion. We hypothesize that IZ-PVs process sensory information to activate specific muscle groups during locomotion and that they play a critical role in activity-based functional recovery following SCI. The ability to identify circuits important for functional recovery relies on how accurately we can quantify differences in behavioral outcomes. We are implementing an unsupervised approach using 3-D pose dynamics and artificial intelligence (AI) to characterize both sensitive behavioral biomarkers and uncover key spinal cord circuits important for the recovery process. Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration are improving, and this project both identifies the neural systems and synaptic mechanisms that would be most effective to target such interventions and establishes an AI-based platform for fast, reliable and unbiased quantification of motor recovery in rodents. Thus, this project makes original and important contributions to the field of spinal cord research in ways that are specifically aligned with central missions of the NINDS. Moreover, our experimental scrutiny at both the neural and behavioral levels establishes a critical foundation for developing a leading research program and securing independent award funding studying the spinal cord circuits important for sensorimotor function and recovery following SCI. To this end, I have developed a thorough and pragmatic career development plan supported by a strong committee of mentors with extensive track records of laboratory and departmental level mentoring and distinguished portfolios of SCI-specific grant support from the NIH, DoD and private foundations. My career development activities will be focused on four aspects of my academic success. 1) Mentorship and guidance focused on laboratory management. 2) Development and growth of my independent research program and award funding, with a focus on SCI research gap-based training. 3) Navigating institutional responsibilities and fulfilling requirements for promotion and tenure. 4) Expanding my scientific network and profile.

"SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home We propose to develop a novel, distributed sensor platform that continuously assesses movement in the background of one's life with the goal of helping people age in place and avoid expensive and lengthy hospitalizations. On the one hand, the platform will combine measurements from a heterogeneous and  complementary set of inertial, physiological , and vision sensors with state-of-the-art techniques from robotics and machine learning, together with clinically informed dynamic models of human motion. On the other hand, the platform will use these data to target the prompt detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty, with the goal of facilitating personalized caregiver alerts if a decline in functional status is detected. Moreover, the platform will provide context-aware control inputs to facilitate unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies in the home. This project has three main thrusts: assessment, control, and home intervention. In the assessment component, our work will extend well-proven techniques of multi-modal sensor fusion for mapping and localization of robots to home-based movement monitoring and intervention. The novelty of this work lies in the tight integration of machine learning modules for real-time activity recognition and movement dysfunction diagnosis. In the control component, our work will push the boundaries of what is possible with current powered assistive devices by developing novel control mechanisms that take advantage of the new capabilities provided by the estimation component (e.g., adapting control to changes in activities and environmental contexts). In the home intervention component, we will collect data that will refine the sensing and control algorithms and involve caregivers in alerts. A patient-in-the-loop development approach will be utilized where domain-informed protocols will generate the data necessary to train and evaluate our system, both in the clinic and in the home. By enabling timely detection of movement dysfunction and facilitating unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies, this foundational technology has paradigm-disrupting potential to prevent the onset of frailty and alter the treatment options for frail individuals. In parallel, the estimation component of the system could be used in clinical settings to automate and standardize time-intensive and highly subjective functional movement assessments, allowing more accurate diagnoses while freeing clinicians for other important tasks. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Frail older adults constitute the sickest, most expensive, and fastest growing segment of the US population. Home-based technologies that facilitate aging in place and reduce high-cost, hospital- and institution-based interventions are desperately needed. Our proposed distributed sensor platform has the potential to address this need by enabling the timely detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty and proactive caregiver and technological interventions that can delay, or prevent, mobility loss. n/a","SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home",10019455,R01AG067394,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging in place', 'base', 'cost', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'functional status', 'human model', 'loss of function', 'multimodality', 'neuroprosthesis', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2020,290216,0.011308783527312396
"Striatal pathophysiology in dystonia Dystonia is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause twisting movements and postures. Although basal ganglia dysfunction is consistently implicated across many forms of dystonia, the underlying pathophysiology is unknown. The major input structure of the basal ganglia is the striatum. The vast majority of neurons in the striatum are GABAergic spiny projection neurons (SPNs). Direct pathway SPNs (dSPNs) project to the internal pallidum (GPi) to promote movement. Indirect pathway SPNs (iSPNs) project to the external pallidum (GPe) to inhibit movement. Although dSPNs and dSPNs are largely segregated into separate pathways, they act in concert and within ensembles of coactivity to select and refine movements. In dystonia patients, this coordinated activity appears to be disrupted as microelectrode recordings in dystonia patients reveal abnormal activity in both GPi and GPe. Although these results implicate abnormal activity in both dSPNs and iSPNs, the abnormal patterns of striatal activity that mediate dystonia are unknown. Several challenges have stymied our ability to understand the abnormal neural code underlying dystonia. First, the information obtained from microelectrode recording in patients is, by necessity, quite limited. Second, because dystonia is induced by movement, recordings must be made in awake unrestrained subjects to obtain authentic results. Third, to meaningfully understand striatal pathophysiology, it is necessary to distinguish between dSPNs and iSPNs, which is challenging to accomplish using microelectrode recordings in vivo because these two distinct cells types are intermingled within the striatum. With the recent development of lightweight miniature fluorescence microscopes that can be used to image the activity of genetically-identified SPNs in freely moving mice, we can overcome these obstacles to understand the physiological substrates of dystonia. For the first experiments to reveal abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia, we will use a knockin mouse model of DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD) in which the striatum is known to play a central role in mediating the dystonia. In fact, both dSPN and iSPN signaling is disrupted in these mice. Thus, we now have an unprecedented opportunity to elucidate the neural code of dystonia for the first time. The Specific Aim is to identify abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia. We will test the hypothesis that dystonia is mediated by abnormal neuronal activity and degraded ensemble activity of dSPNs and iSPNs by performing in vivo Ca2+ imaging in freely moving normal or DRD mice that selectively express the GCaMP6f calcium indicator in either dSPNs or iSPNs. Abnormal firing patterns including the degree of spatial clustering of coactive neurons will be assessed using both well-established approaches and a novel analysis of population dynamics using a machine learning algorithm that we recently developed to identify and predict dystonia-specific neuronal ensemble firing patterns. Although dystonia is the third most common movement disorder after tremor and Parkinson’s disease, treatments for dystonia are inadequate because the underlying neuronal dysfunction is not well understood. Understanding abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia will provide a novel platform for the development of therapeutics that target the abnormal neural code, rather than the traditional one-drug-one-target approach.!",Striatal pathophysiology in dystonia,9957592,R21NS116311,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Code', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dopa-Responsive Dystonia', 'Dopamine', 'Dopamine D1 Receptor', 'Dopamine D2 Receptor', 'Dopamine Receptor', 'Dystonia', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Human', 'Image', 'Involuntary Movements', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Mus', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Mutation', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Dynamics', 'Posture', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tremor', 'abnormal involuntary movement', 'awake', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence microscope', 'in vivo', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'prototype', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective expression', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,427605,0.0074701407329435055
"Circuit dynamics of sensorimotor integration and decision making in octopus Project Summary  The goal of this proposal is to identify fundamental sensorimotor circuits associated with goal-oriented gripping movement by using high-dimensional biological, analytical and robotics technologies. To pursue this, we will study an animal that is extraordinary in many ways, the octopus.  Our interest in this unique invertebrate is based on its well documented complex behavior repertoire that have shown to resemble those of vertebrates. Each of the eight arms contains an axial nerve which functions like the vertebrate’s spinal cord. Previous work demonstrated that a severed octopus arm could exhibit movements that are almost identical to a goal-oriented movement that an intact octopus produces. This suggests that the octopus has a simplified neural program embedded within the arm itself and is adaptable to various degree of input from visual and motor brain areas. Thus, the octopus provides an unparalleled preparation to study central sensorimotor circuits associated with gripping behavior.  We will study the arm motion in the disembodied preparation (representing essentially a detached but functional vertebrate spinal cord) and in an intact, behaving octopus: We will use high-resolution cameras to characterize gripping motion in terms of velocity, trajectory and kinematics; We will develop technologies to wirelessly record multi-unit activity from the axial cord in locations proximate and distal to the brain; We will visualize neural activity in specific neural populations using GCaMP measurements; We will develop machine learning algorithms to link neural processes across multiple scales of structures and time, which will be essential to comparing data obtained from a disembodied arm to an intact arm. We will use the wealth of the multi-modal measurements for building a model-driven empirical design and validate these algorithms by computationally reproducing octopus arm movement and fashioning new movements; We will also test the biologically-inspired algorithms in an unprecedented approach: we will evoke gripping movement in a soft material-based biorobotic arm.  This novel research has the potential to bridge the gap between current BMI technologies and profound understanding of neural circuits associated with the gripping movement, that its impairment is most catastrophic and regaining this function is most desirable to patients. We expect that the sensorimotor circuits dynamics that we will discover will be later used to control locomotion and other adaptive movement in lower extremities. Additionally, this work will establish unparalleled new resources to the scientific community for studying unconventional species, and will fuel the developments of intelligent sensors, methods and frameworks to acquire high- dimensional biological data, and novel approaches to fabricate essential elements of soft robots to build the next generation of bionic limbs.

"Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders Project Summary/Abstract In this K23 career development award, Dr. Rujuta Wilson will develop training in quantitative analysis of motor development to aid in early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Dr. Wilson’s longer-term goal is to be a leading clinician-scientist in motor development, utilizing novel quantitative methods and analyses to identify mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatments of motor impairments across diverse developmental populations affected by these impairments. Through the support of this K23 and the enriched transdisciplinary training environment and resources at UCLA, Dr. Wilson aims to accomplish the following training goals: (1) develop expertise in theoretical models and assessment of infant motor and developmental trajectories, (2) acquire knowledge of optimal statistical methods and skills in longitudinal modeling, signal processing, and machine learning techniques to analyze complex quantitative motor data and develop prediction models, (3) develop proficiency in advanced methods of clinical research design and implementation, and (4) translate the K23 training and findings into an R01 utilizing motor risk markers to aid in clinical stratification and monitor developmental outcomes of a targeted motor intervention. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wilson has assembled an exemplary mentorship team, including her primary mentor, Dr. James McCracken, a child psychiatrist with decades of research dedicated to studying development in children and in design and conduct of clinical trials in NDDs; co-mentor, Dr. Grace Baranek, a leader in the study of sensory- motor and behavioral risk markers of NDDs in the first year of life; co-mentor, Dr. David Elashoff, a leader of biostatistics with extensive knowledge of high dimensional data sets and sensor monitoring data; collaborators and contributors, Drs. William Kaiser, Beth Smith, Shafali Jeste, and Susan Bookheimer, experts in advanced analytic techniques of signal processing and machine learning, wearable sensors, high risk infant studies, and neuroimaging methods in high risk infants, respectively. Motor impairments occur across an array of NDDs and emerge early in disease course, but early identification remains an ongoing challenge due to lack of quantitative measures that can objectively identify these early motor impairments. The overarching goal of the proposed longitudinal study is to (1) utilize a validated wearable sensor to derive quantitative measurements of motor function and identify motor impairments in infants at high risk for NDDs (e.g., infants with an older sibling with Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD]) as early as 3 months of age, and (2) examine the relationship of these motor impairments to symptoms of ASD and to delays in social communication, language, and cognition. This proposal will facilitate the development of novel transdiagnostic motor phenotyping tools that can be utilized to inform clinical screening, clinical risk stratification, and intervention studies across a range of neurologic disorders. These aims directly address NICHD research priorities; in particular, “research establishing the validity of biomarkers and outcome measures for intellectual and developmental disability symptoms.” Project Narrative Motor development plays a crucial role in the acquisition of social communication skills, cognition, and language, and motor impairments detrimentally affect downstream development. Many neurodevelopmental disorders describe motor impairments as an early comorbid symptom; however, current standardized assessments of motor function fail to clearly characteize these early motor impairments. This longitudinal study will utilize quantitative measures to objectively characterize the earliest manifestation of motor impairments in infants at high risk for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders and elucidate the mechanistic relationship of these impairments to symptoms of autism and other adverse developmental outcomes with the goal to improve early identification and inform targeted interventions.",Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders,9977506,K23HD099275,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical stratification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Life Experience', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal Brain Injury', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Space Perception', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual Motor Coordinations', 'advanced analytics', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor impairment', 'multidimensional data', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social communication', 'social engagement', 'standardize measure', 'statistics', 'study population', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2020,177444,-0.0030036509198828223
"Combining Physiological, Genetic, and Computational Approaches with Naturalistic Climbing Behavior to Elucidate the Functional Elements of Descending Motor Control PROJECT SUMMARY Many mammals are distinguished by the exceptional diversity and agility of their limb movement. These qualities are critical to the fitness certain movements confer, and so to the evolutionary success of many species. While brain regions important for limb control have been identified, the neural signal processing that ultimately governs motor commands sent to muscles has remained stubbornly opaque. Mechanistic models of motor system operation in real time during movement are thus lacking. This obscures the etiology of motor deficits caused by neurological disease and stroke, which in turn stymies the development of effective treatments.  A primary cause of this opacity of motor system processing is the ambiguity of the basic functional elements comprising relevant neural circuits. An emerging view posits that these elements may be neuronal subtypes defined by features like axonal target region, target cell identity, and gene expression. Yet the fundamental question of what are the appropriate cellular features for defining functional units remains unanswered. This ambiguity stems from a host of technical limitations. We expect that functionally salient neuronal subtypes will make characteristic contributions to specific phases of movement. Yet traditional methods for silencing neural activity to assess function lack the temporal resolution to discern such specific influence. We also expect that functionally salient subtypes will exhibit distinct activity patterns and interactions with other neuronal populations. But classical methods for measuring neural firing are typically blind to key cellular features. Moreover, the behavioral paradigms used for motor system studies have not captured essential aspects of natural mammalian movement, for which motor system organization may have been adapted over evolution.  Fortunately though, systems neuroscience is currently being revolutionized by advances in physiological, genetic, and computational techniques. I plan to leverage many of these advances and pursue an innovative approach to resolve the basic functional elements within a model motor system population – the subcerebral projection neurons (SPNs) found in motor areas of the neocortex. We will employ a naturalistic climbing paradigm for mice engineered in my lab to overcome limitations of previous motor behavior paradigms. New genetically- mediated targeting strategies will provide access to potential functional subtypes for activity measurement and perturbation. We will novelly couple optogenetic probes, electromyography, and automated behavior decomposition to distinguish precise phases of neuronal subtype influence. Large-scale, multi-area activity recording, optogenetic identification, and machine learning will parse subtypes by their activity and interactions with other neuronal populations. Our work will articulate an interdisciplinary approach applicable to the fundamental question of functional units in other neural systems as well. The mechanistic insight our work begins to build will help elucidate the etiology of movement deficits stemming from conditions like ALS and Huntington’s disease, and following stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our project aims to identify basic functional elements within motor circuits to help build mechanistic models of motor system operation in real time during movement execution. The lack of such models has sharply limited our understanding of the etiology of motor deficits stemming from neurological disease and stroke, which in turn stymies the development of effective treatment. The mechanistic insight our work builds will thus help elucidate the etiology of motor deficits and facilitate improved treatment.","Combining Physiological, Genetic, and Computational Approaches with Naturalistic Climbing Behavior to Elucidate the Functional Elements of Descending Motor Control",10002981,DP2NS120847,"['Area', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Computational Technique', 'Development', 'Electromyography', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Huntington Disease', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'blind', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'limb movement', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'stem', 'success', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,DP2,2020,2340462,0.06273740547978834
"A novel geometric paradigm for nonlinear modeling and control of neural dynamics PROJECT SUMMARY A standing challenge in neuroscience is to control the activity of large populations of interconnected neurons that underlie our brain’s functions and dysfunctions. The dynamics of these neural activity patterns are immensely complex and nonlinear, making their modeling extremely difficult. Thus, the precise control of neural dynamics and the associated mental states using stimulation input has remained elusive to date. If precise dynamic modeling and control was possible, this would both elucidate the neural basis of behavior and treat the most prevalent and disabling mental disorders such as depression or addiction, which are a leading cause of disability worldwide. The goal of this innovative proposal is to move toward making this vision a reality. We will: (1) develop a novel biologically-informed geometric paradigm to achieve nonlinear dynamic modeling and closed-loop control of neural population activity; (2) demonstrate it on brain network activity collected from the monkey motor system and the human corticolimbic system to characterize the neural dynamics of complex movements and control the neural biomarkers of depressed mood, respectively. This geometric paradigm will be based on a central idea: if we learn and model the low-dimensional nonlinear geometric space over which neural population activity evolves in time, we can then analytically write the dynamic model in a much simpler form over this manifold; this will allow for precise modeling of nonlinear dynamics and enable their control, which is otherwise impractical. Capturing the nonlinearity in the geometry to achieve control of brain dynamics with unprecedented precision is a major innovation and departure from current methods. We introduce concepts from algebraic topology and differential geometry into neural dynamic modeling and control. We will develop new methods at the interface of these disciplines, neuroscience, machine learning and control theory to: (1) identify the type of manifold that embeds neural dynamics (e.g., torus or sphere); (2) develop novel algorithms that learn analytical dynamic models over this manifold (both with and without stimulation input); (3) build decoders and controllers of neural dynamics that incorporate the biologically-informed nonlinear geometric models. We will provide three rigorous experimental demonstrations on rich data from two distinct neural systems: (i) existing spike-field activity from monkey motor cortices during complex reach-and-grasps; (ii) existing multisite intracranial human brain activity in the corticolimbic system with simultaneous mood tracking; (iii) new closed-loop control experiments to selectively modulate brain network activity underlying mood states in the corticolimbic system using electrical stimulation. The paradigm will provide a new tool to build interpretable, low-dimensional, and controllable nonlinear models of neural dynamics to elucidate the neural basis of behavior and disease. Also, it will achieve nonlinear closed- loop control of neural dynamics underlying mental states and lead to closed-loop brain stimulation systems that could transform treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression or addiction for millions of patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed geometric paradigm for dynamic modeling and closed-loop control of nonlinear brain dynamics will provide a new scientific tool to study neural mechanisms in health and disease, and innovative closed-loop controllers of mental states with unprecedented precision to facilitate precisely-tailored stimulation treatments for a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, and addiction.

"Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit Abstract The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated, well-timed movements. The cerebellar cortex seems to have a particular role in learning to time movements. Since the 1960's and 70's, we have known the architecture of the cerebellar microcircuit, but most analyses of cerebellar function during behavior have focused on Purkinje cells. Here, we propose to investigate the cerebellar cortex at an entirely new level by asking how the full cerebellar microcircuit – mossy fiber, granule cells, Golgi cells, molecular layer interneurons, and Purkinje cells – performs neural computations during motor behavior and motor learning. We strive to “crack” the circuit by identifying all elements, recording their electrical activity during movement and learning, and reconstructing a neural circuit model that reproduces the biological data. We will use three established learning systems that all can learn predictive timing: classical conditioning of the eyelid response (mice), predictive timing of forelimb movements (mice), and direction learning in smooth pursuit eye movements (monkeys). Our proposal has six key features. First, optogenetics (in mice) will link the discharge of different cerebellar interneurons during movement and learning to their molecular cell types. Second, a machine-learning clustering analysis (in mice and monkeys) will find analogies among the cell populations recorded in our three preparations and will classify neurons according to their putative cell types based on recordings of many parameters of non-Purkinje cells during movement and motor learning. Third, multi- contact electrodes will allow us to record simultaneously from multiple neighboring single neurons and compute spike-timing cross-correlograms (CCGs) to identify the sign of connections; we also will look for changes in CCGs that provide evidence of specific sites of plasticity during learning. Fourth, gCAMP imaging of the granule cell layer will reveal the temporal structure of inputs to the cerebellar microcircuit, and determine whether those inputs are modified in relation to motor learning. Fifth, a model neural network with realistic cerebellar architecture will reveal a single set of model parameters that will transform the measured inputs to the cerebellum in our three movement systems to the measured responses of all neurons in the cerebellar cortex. Sixth, the model will elucidate how mechanisms of synaptic and cellular plasticity at different sites in the cerebellar microcircuit work together to cause motor learning. Project Narrative The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated and well-timed movements. A better understanding of how the cerebellar circuit works and learns will be important for improving human health in cases of stroke, neuro-degenerative motor disease, developmental motor disorders, and adult movement disorders.",Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit,9976609,R01NS112917,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brush Cell', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar Cortex', 'Cerebellum', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collection', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Forelimb', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Smooth Pursuit', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of molecular layer of cerebellar cortex', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'classical conditioning', 'commune', 'design', 'experimental study', 'eyeblink conditioning', 'eyelid conditioning', 'granule cell', 'improved', 'learned behavior', 'mossy fiber', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,1275271,0.054832678140987995
"Chemogenetic afferent modulation to understand spinal cord circuit function and plasticity post injury PROJECT SUMMARY Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes life-long neurological impairment, and there is currently no effective treatment. The premise of this proposal is recent work demonstrating that afferent stimulation paired with treadmill training can enhance standing, stepping, and volitional control in humans and animal models. Therefore, it is critically important to understand the mechanisms by which afferent stimulation drives motor improvement. Tools that can identify which afferents are necessary and sufficient to enhance recovery, and that can facilitate characterization of the helpful neural plasticity, are urgently needed. Our long-term goal is to develop approaches for selective afferent modulation, and apply them to the dissection of the mechanisms underlying recovery from SCI. The objective of this grant is to identify which sets of afferents are important for recovery and how spinal circuits change to facilitate it. To achieve selective modulation of afferents and enable genetic tracing we will use Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) that can modulate excitability in specific populations of neurons. To accurately quantify improvement, we will use Deep Learning to analyze large kinematic data sets. Our preliminary data shows strong expression of DREADDs in large diameter DRG neurons, that their activation by CNO can excite or inhibit the H-reflex, and that activation of excitatory DREADDs during treadmill training post-SCI improves stepping. Our main hypothesis is that activation of large afferents by the excitatory DREADD (hM3Dq) during treadmill training will enhance recovery, whereas inhibitory DREADDs (hM4Di) will suppress recovery. Four sub- hypotheses will test whether recovery is mediated by increased afferent projection onto 1) motor neurons, or 2) inhibitory interneurons; or by sprouting of 3) reticulospinal and 4) propriospinal circuits. Our Specific Aims are to determine whether selective expression of DREADDs in (Aim 1) all large diameter (proprioceptive and tactile) neurons and (Aim 2) large proprioceptive afferents only can enhance recovery. The rationale for these aims is that afferent stimulation is hypothesized to work through selective excitation of large diameter sensory afferents (LDSA) that both drive motor pools locally and facilitate proprio- and surpraspinal input. To date, it has not been possible to definitively determine which afferents were recruited after electrical stimulation, or to select between afferents of similar diameter. The significance of this work lies in determining whether recovery is mediated exclusively by proprioceptive axons or a combination of proprioceptive and tactile afferents, and uncovering the mechanisms of functional plasticity in the spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 300,000 individuals are living with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the USA without an effective treatment. Recently, spinal cord stimulation during rehabilitation has been found to enable better standing, stepping, and voluntary control in patients with SCI. This study will improve our understanding of these mechanisms by 1) using new genetic tools to identify which afferents are necessary and sufficient for improvement, and 2) using genetic tracing techniques to uncover how spinal circuits are changing to enhance function.",Chemogenetic afferent modulation to understand spinal cord circuit function and plasticity post injury,10051492,R01NS114007,"['Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Caliber', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dissection', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'H-Reflex', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Locomotor Recovery', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurostimulation procedures of spinal cord tissue', 'Outcome', 'Parvalbumins', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord Contusions', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Synapses', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toes', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Volition', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'deep learning', 'density', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'effective therapy', 'feeding', 'functional plasticity', 'human model', 'improved', 'injury recovery', 'kinematics', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuronal excitability', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective expression', 'sensory input', 'tool', 'treadmill training', 'vector']",NINDS,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2020,416293,0.02297005439035164
"Multiple timescales of motor planning and execution in mouse cortex Project Summary/Abstract: For animals to execute complicated behaviors, successful motor planning and execution is essential. Moreover, the sequence of events leading to successful goal-based behavior takes place over a wide range of timescales. For example, when walking from home to work, one must first make an abstract, long-timescale decision to go to work, which much then be translated into a sequence of shorter-timescale right-left turning decisions, which are translated into the finely fluctuating electrical patterns that control the muscles. How motor planning and execution occur simultaneously over many timescales in populations of motor cortex neurons is not well understood. Much work in humans and nonhuman primates have shown that visual and auditory stimuli integrate over multiple timescales. This work has shown that early sensory regions, like primary visual cortex, respond to fast fluctuations in the environment. This information is integrated to longer-timescale information in secondary cortical regions, with the longest- timescale information in frontal and association areas. We therefore hypothesize that secondary motor cortex (M2) neurons control behavior over longer timescales than primary motor cortex (M1) neurons. To study this phenomenon, I have built a setup in which head-fixed mice navigate in virtual reality to a rewarded location. In this setup, I can record video from all sides of the animal for high spatiotemporal resolution measurement of motor behaviors. I have developed machine learning algorithms to extract 3D pose data from these videos. In Aim 1, I will use calcium imaging to record large numbers of neurons in mouse M1 and M2 to correlate the activity of individual neurons and populations to the animal’s ongoing pose kinematics. We will supplement with targeted silicon probe recordings to capture fast neural responses. In Aim 2, I will compare the calcium dynamics in populations of M1 and M2 neurons in mice trained to perform a virtual motor planning task versus mice that have not been trained. We hypothesize that training to plan motor actions increases the timescale of M1/M2 neural activity. In Aim 3, we will use optogenetic silencing in specific regions of cortex to perturb the animal’s motor behavior. We hypothesize that the duration of the perturbed movements will be longer when M2 is perturbed than M1. In this way, we will study how different cortical regions relate to behavior over many timescales. This proposal will broaden our knowledge of cortical processing in general, and motor planning and execution in particular. Patients with mental illness, such as ADHD, autism, and Asperger’s disorder show impaired ability to plan upcoming movements. The first step to successfully treating these illnesses is to better understand how motor planning occurs in general. Project Narrative: This proposal will elucidate how motor planning and execution take place simultaneously, over many timescales, and across brain regions. Better understanding motor planning will help generate new treatments for diseases that affect motor planning, like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism.",Multiple timescales of motor planning and execution in mouse cortex,10007591,F31NS108450,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Asperger Syndrome', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laser Scanning Microscopy', 'Lasers', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Side', 'Silicon', 'Stereotyping', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'area striata', 'auditory stimulus', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'frontal lobe', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor behavior', 'neuromechanism', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory stimulus', 'spatiotemporal', 'theories', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2020,33236,0.034096082156101264
"A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis Project Summary  The goal of the proposed work is to develop a robust hybrid neural-machine interface (NMI), combining brain and muscle signals, to improve overall control of a lower limb prosthetic device during activities of daily living. Limb amputation affects over 600,000 individuals annually in the US, and is a major cause of physical disability that causes activities of daily living to become difficult or impossible for the amputee. The limitations of current lower-limb prostheses are associated with limited volitional control, reduced mobility, and chronic gait abnormalities, which have been linked to exhaustion from increased energy expenditure, increased risk of falling, and degenerative bone and joint disorders in both the intact and amputated limb. In this study, EMG signals from both residual and intact lower limbs and EEG signals from the cortex are leveraged to decode transitions to and from various modes of locomotion modes in able-bodied individuals and transfemoral amputees, and to provide a global understanding of movement at the cortical, muscular, and kinematic level in amputees. Specifically, time and frequency domain features are leveraged to create a prediction algorithm capable of identifying upcoming terrain transitions in advance. In lower limb amputees, this hybrid NMI paradigm translates to volitional control of a powered lower-limb prosthesis, which allows for seamless transitions between various movement conditions. The high-level of control is expected to result in significant increases in level of activity and overall improvements in gait. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of EEG or EMG based NMIs for orthotic and prosthetic devices; however, no study to date has integrated EEG and EMG in a NMI for powered lower limb prostheses. This study is motivated by the need to explore advanced neural control sources for intuitive control of artificial limbs.  This project aligns directly with the Mission & Goals of the NIH, the Brain Initiative, and NIH’s Blueprint Program by expanding fundamental knowledge of neuroscience, human, health and wellness; by utilizing an innovative research strategy; and ultimately returning the knowledge to the public through the development of a highly advanced medical technology. Furthermore, the technology developed through this work has implications beyond the amputee population in the treatment of many neurological conditions and injuries, such as in neurorehabilitation after stroke. The innovation of this project lies in the novel approach of using multimodal neural signals and movement synergies as a framework for interpreting movement of the lower limb. The scientific impact is realized by a greater understanding of the neural correlates of movement after lower-limb amputation. The direct clinical significance for the patient can be measured directly through improved gait performance and walking confidence, leading to increased mobility and a reduced risk of falling, exhaustion, and bone and joint disorders. Project Narrative  The development of a hybrid neural-machine interface that incorporates muscle and brain signaling for communication with robotic systems is important to public health because it allows for robust volitional control of powered prostheses and exoskeletons during activities of daily living. This will directly benefit the amputee population by allowing better control of their prosthesis during locomotion, especially when navigating complex terrains, such as stairs and inclines. The implications of this technology can be used beyond the amputee population to further understand the effect of neurological injuries on the brain, and for improving rehabilitation paradigms associated with their treatment.",A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis,10214202,K00NS105210,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Amputees', 'Ankle', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Bone Diseases', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Electronic Mail', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Agency', 'Future Teacher', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Neurosciences', 'Oral', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prosthesis', 'Public Health', 'Ramp', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Robotics', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Surface', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Volition', 'Walking', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'exhaustion', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel strategies', 'physically handicapped', 'post stroke', 'posters', 'powered exoskeleton', 'powered prosthesis', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'rehabilitation paradigm', 'relating to nervous system', 'robot control', 'robot exoskeleton', 'robot rehabilitation', 'robotic system', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'undergraduate student', 'visual motor']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K00,2020,72598,0.056092115484414194
"GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT  Human locomotion through natural environments requires the coordination of all levels of the sensorimotor hierarchy, from the cortical areas involved in processing of visual information and high level planning to the subcortical and spinal structures involved in the regulation of the gait and posture. However, despite the complex neural bases of human locomotion, the output is highly regular and well organized around the basic physical dynamics and biomechanics that define the stability and energetic costs of moving a bipedal body through space. There is a rich and growing body of literature describing detailed knowledge each of the individual components of human locomotion, including neural mechanisms, muscular neuromechanics, and biomechanics. However, very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion through a complex and dynamic world. This lack of integrative research not only restricts the breadth of impact of research from these individual disciplines, but also limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, it is necessary to develop an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world. In service of this general goal, this proposal outlines research projects aimed at specific unanswered questions about locomotion over different terrains. This proposal comprises three specific research and training aims on the visual control of locomotion over rough terrain. Aim 1 focuses on the behavioral task itself, Aim 2 investigates the sensory stimulus experienced during real-world locomotion, and Aim 3 examines the motor integration of visually specified goals into the ongoing gait cycle. Aim 1 investigates effects of changing environmental uncertainty and task demands on gaze allocation strategies during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 2 analyzes and models the visual stimulus experienced during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 3 determines how visually specified target footholds and targets are integrated into the ongoing preferred steady-state gait. Together these aims will significantly advance our understanding of how humans use vision to control their movement through the natural world, which greatly increase our ability to develop clinical diagnosis and treatment for loss of locomotor function. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion.

"Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning Project Summary Behavior and cognition emerge from the coordinated activity of populations of interacting neurons. To change behavior we must change the architecture of the network that drives behavior. What are the rules whereby the activity of populations of neurons can change during learning? If we could observe the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning, we might be able to facilitate learning. This ability may eventually lead to improvements to neurally- based rehabilitation strategies that can facilitate the recovery from stroke.  We will use a neurofeedback paradigm to shape the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning. To do this, we will record the activity of dozens of neurons in the motor cortex of Rhesus monkey subjects. Animals will control a cursor on a computer screen by generating neural command signals. This is neurofeedback because the animal directly observes a projection of his neural activity, in the form of the movement of the onscreen cursor. This paradigm allows us to study learning simply by perturbing the mapping from neural activity to cursor movement on the screen. Following such a perturbation the animal must discover how to generate new patterns of neural activity that are now appropriate to restore good control of the onscreen cursor.  We will ask two linked questions. First, how does the animal learn to generate new patterns of neural activity? And second, can we facilitate that process? Neurofeedback-based learning offers complementary advantages to arm movements for studying the neural population dynamics that accompany learning. Chieﬂy, only in a neurofeedback paradigm can we be certain that the learning-induced changes in neural activity we observe matter directly for behavior, because only the neurons we record directly impact behavior in this paradigm.  We will test classic theories of skill learning, converted into speciﬁc hypotheses about how neural activity patterns will change throughout the multi-day course of skill learning.  If our neurofeedback-based incremental training schemes do facilitate learning, then this research will inform the work of rehabilitation specialists who work with stroke patients. We (and others) believe that if neurofeedback-based therapies are coupled with standard behavioral therapies for stroke, rehabilitation outcomes will improve. Project Narrative Stroke can be a debilitating condition. Only ﬁfty percent of stroke survivors make a full recovery, and that is usually only after extensive rehabilitation. The recovery from stroke and skill learning are probably closely related. We propose to develop brain-computer interface neurofeedback paradigms to facilitate the learning of new skills. If this is effective in our animal subjects it will provide new avenues to explore for stroke rehabilitation.",Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning,9900034,R01HD071686,"['Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Computers', 'Control Animal', 'Couples Therapy', 'Data', 'Electrodes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'arm movement', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain computer interface', 'design', 'forging', 'functional restoration', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'motor learning', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'network architecture', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurofeedback', 'neuromechanism', 'post stroke', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'restoration', 'skills', 'stroke model', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'theories', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,423660,-0.06417773694528651
"Robust biomimetic models of human legs to solve high-dimensional real-time control problems Project Summary  Anatomically validated musculoskeletal models of human limbs computed faster than real-time are tools that will help advance the control of neuroprosthetics, rehabilitation, and the study of motor control principles. However, the current state-of-the-art models cannot be both accurate and fast. We propose to develop a new generation of validated real-time human leg models with musculoskeletal dynamics that are robust over the full range of multidimensional motion. The first aim is to validate a lower-limb model in the full range of static postures. The second aim is to validate a lower-limb model during dynamic locomotor tasks.  Building on our previous work, we will use OpenSim model repository as a starting point for the iterative process of validating the muscle anatomy and function using published anatomical data. We expect to recreate the full range of leg postures with the validated model. We will then collect data during locomotor tasks performed by healthy humans on the split-belt treadmill with simultaneous re- cordings of ground reaction forces, full-body motion capture, and surface electromyography from rep- resentative leg muscles. The model will be validated over a rich experimental dataset for locomotor pat- terns required in asymmetric stepping on a self-paced treadmill. We expect to validate the dynamic model by estimating in real-time the observed full body kinematics from muscle activity and ground reaction forces. The inverse solutions will allow us to estimate the ongoing spatiotemporal patterns of muscle activity.  At the conclusion of this study we will develop the detailed lower-limb model with high-di- mensional robust muscle path simulations to predict limb motion in real-time. The outcomes of this proposal will inform future work on the use of the real-time musculoskeletal models for the develop- ment of augmentation devices and the clinical assessment of locomotor deficits. Project Narrative The significance of this project is that it will address the major challenges in achieving intuitive human-computer interactions by allowing the simulation of high-dimensional muscle dynamics in real-time. The main innovation of this proposal is the rigorous validation of human leg model across large anthropomorphic variations (due to age and sex) and the robust performance using novel method for musculoskeletal simulations.",Robust biomimetic models of human legs to solve high-dimensional real-time control problems,9979392,R03HD099426,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biomimetics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electromyography', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Failure', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Leg', 'Length', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Neuromechanics', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical therapy', 'Polynomial Models', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'computer human interaction', 'high dimensionality', 'human model', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'locomotor deficit', 'locomotor tasks', 'model development', 'motor control', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'real time model', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'sex', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'treadmill']",NICHD,WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,76000,0.01749165833469508
"Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of sensation from the limbs. The past 15 years have seen remarkable advances in “Brain Machine Interfaces” (BMIs) that allow paralyzed persons to move anthropomorphic limbs using signals recorded directly from their brains. However, these movements remain slow, clumsy, and effortful, looking remarkably like those of individuals who have lost sensation from their arms due to peripheral neuropathy. Brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are unlikely to achieve high levels of performance in the absence of artificial sensory feedback. Early attempts at restoring somatosensation used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate somatosensory cortex (s1), requiring animals to learn largely arbitrary patterns of stimulation to represent two or three virtual objects or to navigate in two-dimensional space. While an important beginning, this approach seems unlikely to scale to the broad range of limb movements and interactions with objects that we experience in daily life.  To move the field past this hurdle, we propose to replace both touch and proprioception by using multi- electrode ICMS to produce naturalistic patterns of neuronal activity in S1 of monkeys. In Aim 1, we will develop model-optimized mappings between limb state (pressure on the fingertip, or motion of the limb) and the patterns of ICMS required to evoke S1 activation that mimics that of natural inputs. These maps will account for both the dynamics of neural responses and the biophysics of ICMS. We anticipate that this biomimetic approach will evoke intuitive sensations that require little or no training to interpret. We will validate the maps by comparing natural and ICMS-evoked S1 activity using novel hardware that allows for concurrent ICMS and neural recording. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of monkeys to recognize objects using artificial touch. Having learned to identify real objects by touch, animals will explore virtual objects with an avatar that shadows their own hand movements, receiving artificial touch sensations when the avatar contacts objects. We will test their initial performance on the virtual stereognosis task without learning, as well as their improvements in performance over time. Aim 3 will be similar, but will focus on proprioception. We will train monkeys to report the direction of brief force bumps applied to their hand. After training, we will replace the actual bumps with virtual bumps created by patterned ICMS, again asking the monkeys to report their perceived sense of the direction and magnitude of the perturbation. Finally, in Aim 4, we will temporarily paralyze the monkey's arm, thereby removing both touch and proprioception, mimicking the essential characteristics of a paralyzed patient. The avatar will be controlled based on recordings from motor cortex and guided by artificial somatosensation. The monkey will reach to a set of virtual objects, find one with a particular shape, grasp it, and move it to a new location. If we can demonstrate that this model-optimized, biomimetic feedback is informative and easy to learn, it should form the basis for robust, scalable, somatosensory feedback for BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of feeling from the limbs (somatosensation); brain machine interfaces (BMIs), which record signals directly from the brain, can be used to control prosthetic devices, computers, or environmental controls. However, BMIs currently do not restore somatosensation, a critical component of normal limb movement. We propose to develop a new type of brain interface that will mimic the somatosensory brain activity generated during movement and provide natural and informative artificial sensation for people with paralysis or limb amputation.",Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation,9932509,R01NS095251,"['Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cutaneous', 'Electrodes', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Block', 'Neurons', 'Numbness', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stereognosis', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'infancy', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'microstimulation', 'mind control', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prosthesis control', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory feedback', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual environment', 'visual feedback']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,615717,0.05871557050564733
"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity. We will model how the cerebellum simple spike cognitive error signal might propagate through the network and be used to facilitate visuomotor association learning and the processing of signals in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex Project Narrative Learning that a particular object cues a particular action, as a red light makes us stop walking or brake the car, is critical for human behavior and can be degraded by human disease. This project will apply physiological, computational, and anatomical methods to investigate a brain network for visual learning. We will find the exact areas of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum that participate in this learning, and use machine learning techniques to understand how the activity of neurons recorded simultaneously in these brain areas can facilitate learning.",The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning,9983219,R01NS113078,"['Affect', 'Agonist', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar Cortex', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fractals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Injections', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Reaction Time', 'Reading', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Work', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'human disease', 'kinematics', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'success', 'visual learning', 'visual motor']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,1025216,0.016279780902787692
"Neuron- and Circuit-Specific Mechanisms and Adaptations Regulating Motor Function in Parkinson Disease Models ABSTRACT  Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease (after Alzheimer's disease), afflicting tens of millions worldwide. The characteristic disease symptoms arise from basal ganglia dysfunction that occurs secondary to loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Symptomatic treatment is focused either on replacing dopamine or disrupting aberrant activity through deep- brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus or the primary basal ganglia output nucleus in the primate, internal globus pallidus (GPi). This proposal is aimed at understanding the function and dysfunction of basal ganglia circuitry in mice, at the output of the basal ganglia to motor thalamus. In Aim 1, we will develop strategies to identify basal ganglia-recipient motor thalamus neurons in ventral anterior/ventral lateral thalamus (VA/VL), and characterize their projection targets and cortical inputs in awake, behaving animals. In Aim 2, we will use sophisticated in vivo strategies to record from posterior EP neurons and VA/VL neurons as animals move their limbs during locomotion, a fixed repetitive behavior. We will perturb activity in this pathway using optogenetics to determine the contribution of activity in these neurons to forelimb movements, and we will examine how activity in this pathway is altered after loss of striatal dopamine. In Aim 3, we will perform similar experiments in mice performing a lever-pulling task, a flexible forelimb movement. We will examine both cued and uncued versions of this task to distinguish activity generated internally vs. externally. Finally, we will examine how loss of striatal dopamine impacts EP and VA/VL activity during flexible forelimb movements. Our overarching goal is to understand how loss of striatal dopamine in PD leads to disruptions in basal ganglia circuit function and motor deficits, in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies for treating PD motor symptoms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Parkinson's disease (PD) results from a progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the midbrain, most of which innervate the basal ganglia. Here, we propose to study the effects of dopamine loss in mice, focusing on the function of the entopeduncular nucleus (a rodent equivalent of the internal globus pallidus, major output nucleus of the basal ganglia, and a site of deep brain stimulation in PD) and the ventral motor thalamus. Remarkably, the function of these regions remains mysterious, yet they hold great promise for understanding PD and developing new therapeutic strategies for treating PD symptoms.",Neuron- and Circuit-Specific Mechanisms and Adaptations Regulating Motor Function in Parkinson Disease Models,9971314,R01NS064984,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Axon', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain Stem', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Characteristics', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dopamine', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Eye Movements', 'Forelimb', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homologous Gene', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Limb structure', 'Locomotion', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Secondary to', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'Subthalamic structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'awake', 'base', 'body position', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'density', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'endopeduncular nucleus', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'motor symptom', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pars compacta', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'symptom treatment', 'tool']",NINDS,J.

Neural stem cells (NSCs) have been seen as a potential therapeutic option for severe pediatric TBI with the ability to differentiate and integrate into TBI brain tissue and replace damaged and lost neural networks. Many of these studies have demonstrated that NSC therapy leads to significant improvements in motor function, learning and memory in rodent models. However, no study to date has closely examined the potential of NSC to undergo region specific differentiation in a discreate injured brain region and correlated it with a measurable change in brain network activity and functional recovery. In this application, we propose to fill this knowledge gap by examining in-depth the effect of transplanted NSC differentiation and engraftment into the damaged primary motor cortex on improving brain motor network activity and motor function in a pediatric piglet model. We hypothesize that induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived NSCs (iNSCs) transplanted into the damaged primary motor cortex will undergo region specific neural differentiation leading to brain motor network and motor function recovery in a pediatric piglet TBI model. The contribution of this work is highly significant and innovative since successful completion of this project will directly lead to new insights into the ability of transplanted iNSC to undergo regionalized specific differentiation and integration, and rigorously and quantitatively assess functional recovery at the brain and whole animal level. This critical information will advance TBI cell therapy with broad implications in the neural injury, cell therapy, and tissue engineering fields at large. Testing in a translational pig model is critical due to key similarities in brain anatomy and physiology relative to rodents; thus, making findings in the pig more predictive of what would occur in human patients. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in children with 37,200 children suffering a severe TBI with most dying or experiencing “unfavorable outcomes” within 6 months. In this proposal we study the potential of induced pluripotent stem cell derived neural stem cells as a novel regenerative cell therapy for stroke in a translational pig stroke model. These findings, in addition to future studies, are expected to lead to a regenerative cell therapy that can help improve the long-term quality of life for TBI patients.",NSC Function in a Motor Cortex TBI,10089946,R21NS119167,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Astrocytes', 'Biomechanics', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cell physiology', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Development', 'Engraftment', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Family suidae', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery of Function', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'SOX1 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem cell transplant', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Transplantation', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Tubulin', 'Weight', 'Work', 'association cortex', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insight', 'motor deficit', 'motor function recovery', 'myelination', 'nerve injury', 'nerve stem cell', 'neural correlate', 'neural network', 'novel', 'pediatric traumatic brain injury', 'regenerative', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'stem cell biology', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell fate', 'stem cell therapy', 'stroke model', 'stroke therapy', 'synaptogenesis', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R21,2020,390500,-0.0026389930592705824
