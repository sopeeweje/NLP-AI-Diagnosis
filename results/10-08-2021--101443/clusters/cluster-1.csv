"Integrative Predictors of Temporomandibular Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This application proposes the development of efficient web-based data management, mining, and analytics, to integrate and analyze clinical, biological, and high dimensional imaging data from TMJ OA patients. Based on our published results, we hypothesize that patterns of condylar bone structure, clinical symptoms, and biological mediators are unrecognized indicators of the severity of progression of TMJ OA. Efficiently capturing, curating, managing, integrating and analyzing this data in a manner that maximizes its value and accessibility is critical for the scientific advances and benefits that such comprehensive TMJ OA patient information may enable. High dimensional databases are increasingly difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional processing applications, creating a continuing demand for innovative approaches. Toward this end, the DCBIA at the Univ. of Michigan has partnered with the University of North Carolina, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Kitware Inc. Through high-dimensional quantitative characterization of individuals with TMJ OA, at molecular, clinical and imaging levels, we will identify phenotypes at risk for more severe prognosis, as well as targets for future therapies. The proposed web-based system, the Data Storage for Computation and Integration (DSCI), will remotely compute machine learning, image analysis, and advanced statistics from prospectively collected longitudinal data on patients with TMJ OA. Due to its ubiquitous design in the web, DSCI software installation will no longer be required. Our long-term goal is to create software and data repository for Osteoarthritis of the TMJ. Such repository requires maintaining the data in a distributed computational environment to allow contributions to the database from multi-clinical centers and to share trained models for TMJ classification. In years 4 and 5 of the proposed work, the dissemination and training of clinicians at the Schools of Dentistry at the University of North Carol, Univ. of Minnesota and Oregon Health Sciences will allow expansion of the proposed studies. In Aim 1, we will test state-of-the-art neural network structures to develop a combined software module that will include the most efficient and accurate neural network architecture and advanced statistics to mine imaging, clinical and biological TMJ OA markers identified at baseline. In Aim 2, we propose to develop novel data analytics tools, evaluating the performance of various machine learning and statistical predictive models, including customized- Gaussian Process Regression, extreme boosted trees, Multivariate Varying Coefficient Model, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic net, Random Forest, pdfCluster, decision tree, and support vector machine. Such automated solutions will leverage emerging computing technologies to determine risk indicators for OA progression in longitudinal cohorts of TMJ health and disease.

"Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is a leading reversible cause of death after blunt trauma. Prediction of arterial bleeding risk is difficult, and currently determined using subjective criteria, often based on qualitative results of admission computed tomography (CT). Segmented hematoma and contrast extravasation (CE) volumes predict need for angioembolization, major transfusion, and mortality but cannot be applied in real-time. The ill-defined multi-focal nature of pelvic hematomas and CE prevents reliable estimation using diameter-based measurements. Dr. Dreizin is a trauma radiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. His early work has focused on improving the speed and reliability of volumetric analysis of pelvic hematomas using semi-automated techniques, and derivation of a logistic regression-based prediction tool for major arterial injury after pelvic fractures. Dr. Dreizin’s goal for this four- year K08 mentored career development award proposal is to gain the skills needed to 1) implement deep learning architectures for automated hematoma volume segmentation and 2) develop computational models for outcome prediction after pelvic trauma. These tools could greatly improve the speed and accuracy of clinical decision making in the setting of life-threatening traumatic pelvic bleeding. Fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have emerged as the most robust and scalable method for automated medical image segmentation. Intuitive software platforms for training FCN implementations and generating multivariable machine learning models have been developed in the Python programming environment. The training objectives and research activities of this proposal are necessary to provide Dr. Dreizin with new skills and practical experience in Python programming, deep learning software, and computational modeling software. By understanding the principles and computational infrastructure behind modern machine learning, Dr. Dreizin will be able to train and validate state-of-the-art algorithms independently and effectively lead a team of researchers in this area. To achieve his goals, Dr. Dreizin has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors, advisors, and collaborators with world-leading expertise in computer vision in medical imaging, probability theory, data science, and comparative effectiveness research. Dr. Dreizin will focus on two specific aims. In Aim 1, he will train and validate deep learning architectures for segmentation of traumatic pelvic hematomas and CE by computing the Dice metric, time effort, and correlation with clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, he will generate and test quantitative models for predicting major arterial bleeding after pelvic trauma based on a rich multi-label dataset of segmented features. The training and pilot data will be necessary for Dr. Dreizin’s long- term goal of research independence and R01 support to develop automated segmentation algorithms for the spectrum of clinically important imaging features after pelvic trauma, as well as fully automated multivariable clinical prediction tools with potential for translation to industry and as an FDA-cleared product. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is common after motor vehicle collisions, falls, and crush injuries, with mortality rates that range from 5-54%. The volume of hemorrhage, as measured on computed tomography (CT) scans, predicts the need for rapid intervention or transfusion, and is a strong predictor of mortality, but no automated image-processing methods exist for real-time hemorrhage volume measurement. We propose to develop automated software for hemorrhage-detection, and real-time risk prediction software for major arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures.",Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures,9819865,K08EB027141,"['Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arterial Injury', 'Award', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Caliber', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Crush Injury', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Extravasation', 'Fall injury', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hematoma', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maryland', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Predictive Value', 'Probability Theory', 'Process', 'Programming Languages', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shorthand', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Vehicle crash', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adverse outcome', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computer infrastructure', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effectiveness research', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'heuristics', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'muscle form', 'neural network architecture', 'outcome prediction', 'pelvis fracture', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'radiologist', 'random forest', 'real time model', 'secondary outcome', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K08,2019,186183,0.011733348938578206
"A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney Project Summary  Despite the widespread prevalence of ultrasound imaging in hospitals today, the clinical utility of ultrasound guidance is severely hampered by clutter and reverberation artifacts that obscure structures of interest and com- plicate anatomical measurements. Clutter is particularly problematic in overweight and obese individuals, who account for 78.6 million adults and 12.8 million children in North America. Similarly, interventional procedures of- ten require insertion of one or more metal tools, which generate reverberation artifacts that obfuscate instrument location, orientation, and geometry, while obscuring nearby tissues, thus additionally hampering ultrasound im- age quality. Although artifacts are problematic, ultrasound continues to persist primarily because of its greatest strengths (i.e., mobility, cost, non-ionizing radiation, real-time visualization, and multiplanar views) in comparison to existing image-guidance options, but it would be signiﬁcantly more useful without problematic artifacts.  Our long-term project goal is to use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to provide interventional radiologists with artifact-free ultrasound-based images. We will initially develop a new framework alternative to the ultrasound beamforming process that removes needle tip reverberations and acoustic clutter caused by multipath scattering in near-ﬁeld tissues when guiding needles to the kidney to enable removal of painful kidney stones. Our ﬁrst aim will test convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that input raw channel data and output human readable images with no artifacts caused by multipath scattering and reverberations. A secondary goal of the CNNs is to learn the minimum number of parameters required to create these new CNN-based images. Our second aim will validate the trained algorithms with ultrasound data from experimental phantom and ex vivo tissue. Our third aim will extend our evaluation to ultrasound images of in vivo porcine kidneys. This work is the ﬁrst to propose bypassing the entire beamforming process and replacing it with machine learning and computer vision techniques to remove traditionally problematic noise artifacts and create a fundamentally new type of artifact-free, high-contrast, high-resolution, ultrasound-based image for guiding interventional procedures.  This work combines the expertise of an imaging scientist, a computer scientist, and an interventional ra- diologist to explore an untapped, understudied area that is only recently made feasible through improvements in computing power, advances in computer vision capabilities, and new knowledge about dominant sources of image degradation. Translation to in vivo cases is enabled by our clinical collaboration with the Department of Radiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to develop these tools and capabilities to eliminate noise artifacts in interventional ultrasound, opening the door to a new paradigm in ultrasound image formation, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients with clearer, easier-to-interpret ultrasound images. Subsequent R01 funding will customize our innovation to addi- tional application-speciﬁc ultrasound procedures (e.g., breast biopsies, cancer detection, autonomous surgery). Project Narrative Artifacts in ultrasound images, speciﬁcally artifacts caused by multipath scattering and acoustic reverberations (which occur when imaging through the abdominal tissue of overweight and obese patients or visualizing metallic surgical tools), remain as a major clinical challenge. There are no existing solutions to eliminate these artifacts based on today's signal processing techniques. The goal of this project is to step away from conventional signal processing models and instead learn from raw data examples with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that differentiate artifacts from true signals, and thereby deliver clearer, easier-to-interpret images.",A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney,9748523,R21EB025621,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Biopsy', 'Breast biopsy', 'Bypass', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Fatty Liver', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interventional Ultrasonography', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver diseases', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Needles', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'North America', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Readability', 'Resolution', 'Retroperitoneal Space', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surgical Instruments', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fetal', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'imaging scientist', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'signal processing', 'tool']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,195128,0.0011218153430150068
"Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors Project Summary/Abstract One of the key advances in modern positron emission tomography (PET) systems for clinical imaging is the use of time-of-flight (TOF) information. In cancer imaging TOF provides superior lesion detection and more accurate quantification that is crucial in measuring response to therapy, as well as in neurological and cardiovascular imaging applications. An additional benefit of TOF is the ability to lower the radiation dose or scan time without sacrificing image quality, important for patient safety and comfort. The magnitude of these clinical benefits is determined by the TOF resolution of the PET detectors, therefore the prospect of achieving unprecedented image quality and clinical imaging capabilities with superior TOF resolution has fueled significant research in developing detector technology for TOF-PET systems. However, these developments have been largely unaccompanied by advances in signal processing methods needed to extract TOF information from the detector’s electrical signals, with most detectors making use of crude analog algorithms that discard most of the useful timing information contained in the signals. Now, with the availability of low-cost fast waveform digitizers, there is an exciting opportunity to implement sophisticated digital signal processing algorithms to achieve superior TOF resolution. The main advantage of developing advanced signal processing algorithms is that it presents a cost-effective route to improved TOF resolution that is complementary to instrumentation innovations. In essence, the TOF gain comes for free; the detector signals already contain the information needed for better TOF resolution, it just needs to be used effectively. Here we propose to tailor deep learning techniques to estimate TOF from the detector signals. Deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a powerful approach to learn complex representations of input data that can be used for tasks such as classification and regression. CNNs are therefore very suitable for directly estimating TOF from the detector waveforms, since these waveforms are influenced by several complex and intertwined processes which are hard to accurately model. Furthermore, large amounts of ground truth training data are readily generated. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of CNN-based TOF estimation, and found up to 23% improvement in TOF resolution compared to standard signal processing methods. This proposal aims to optimize these methods to push the limits of achievable TOF resolution and develop methods for their practical implementation. First, we will develop CNN architectures and methods suitable for silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) that are now used in modern TOF-PET systems. We will also optimize the digitizing parameters to make optimal use of CNNs for TOF estimation. Second, we will implement CNN-TOF methods in a modern commercial PET detector, including using a global CNN to simultaneously estimate TOF and the crystal-of-interaction from the detector waveforms, demonstrating the practical feasibility of using this promising deep learning method in next generation PET systems. Narrative The use of time-of-flight information in positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful way to increase clinical imaging capabilities of PET, and is now used in most modern systems. Improving time-of-flight performance promises to provide substantial benefits for lesion detection in cancer imaging, kinetic modeling with dynamic imaging, and the use of lower radiation dose for patient safety. Here we introduce deep learning signal processing methods to significantly improve the performance of time-of-flight PET detectors without requiring new materials, which thereby represents a cost effective route towards maximizing the use of the rich imaging signal provided by time-of-flight.",Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors,9784818,R03EB027268,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Electronics', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human Engineering', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'analog', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'clinical imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'neural network architecture', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'photomultiplier', 'physical process', 'response', 'scale up', 'signal processing', 'time use', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2019,78500,0.032223121658071556
"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress. We will then to apply this in a prospective, adaptive validation trial against oxygen-15 water PET CBF, using simultaneous PET/MRI to minimize biological variability. Finally, we will apply this improv- ed tool to study the effects of gender on CVR and its reproducibility. Successful completion of this study will result in a validated methodology to assess CVR in cerebrovascular disease patients without the use of radiation or contrast. As such, it will provide solid, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians developing new paradigms and interventions in patients with impaired CVR. There is strong evidence that imaging of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), the ability to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to a challenge, can identify patients at increased risk of stroke. Therefore, measuring CVR would be extremely useful for designing clinical trials of interventions to mitigate this risk. However, current methods to measure CBF and CVR are suboptimal, and do not work well in patients with cerebrovascular disease. The goals of this project are • to improve non-contrast, radiation-free arterial spin label MRI methods  using deep learning, a powerful form of artificial intelligence that has  shown tremendous progress for computer vision • to validate these methods against a CBF gold-standard, oxygen-15 water  PET, using simultaneous PET/MRI, using an adaptive “play-the-winner” strategy • to apply them to assess gender differences in CVR and test their  reproducibility, with the goal of establishing age and gender normative  ranges to better identify outliers.",Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning,9789276,R01EB025220,"['Acetazolamide', 'Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Bypass', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Cytolysis', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Excision', 'Gadolinium', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'ImProv', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Japanese Population', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Premenopause', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Spin Labels', 'Stress Tests', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Waste Products', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Xenon', 'base', 'blood flow measurement', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'cerebrovascular', 'cerebrovascular imaging', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'design', 'direct application', 'disability', 'evidence based guidelines', 'gender difference', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'men', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'response', 'stressor', 'stroke risk', 'systematic review', 'time use', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,586260,-0.07329015892014451
"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,9783816,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Step training', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'patient population', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,438449,0.04527851426141638
"Synergistic integration of deep learning and regularized image reconstruction for positron emission tomography Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography (PET) is a high-sensitivity molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, with the ability to observe molecular-level activities inside a living body through the injection of specific radioactive tracers. In addition to the commonly used F-18-FDG, new tracers are being constantly developed and investigated to pinpoint specific pathways in various diseases. New PET scanners are also being proposed by exploiting time of flight (TOF) information, enabling depth of interaction capability, and extending the solid angle coverage. To realize the full potential of the new PET tracers and scanners, there is an increasing need for the development of advanced image reconstruction methods. This grant application proposes a new framework for regularized image reconstruction that synergistically integrates deep learning and regularized image reconstruction. The new framework is enabled by the recent advances in machine learning, which provide a tool to digest vast amount information embedded in existing medical images. The proposed method embeds a pre-trained deep neural network in an iterative image reconstruction framework and uses the deep neural network to regularize PET image directly. By training the deep neural network with a large amount of high-quality low-noise PET images, the proposed method can capture complex prior information from existing inter-subject and intra-subject data and thus is expected to substantially outperform the current state-of-the-art regularized image reconstruction method. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop the theoretical framework to synergistically integrate deep learning in regularized image reconstruction for PET and (2) to implement the proposed method and validate its effectiveness using existing animal data. Once the proposed method is validated using existing animal data, we will seek funding to acquire necessary human data for the implementation of the proposed method on clinical PET scanners. Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique widely used in clinic for detecting cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders. This project will develop an innovative image reconstruction method that has potential to improve PET image quality and reduce radiation dose. Its success will improve the accuracy of PET for cancer detection and other diseases.",Synergistic integration of deep learning and regularized image reconstruction for positron emission tomography,9752639,R21EB026668,"['Advanced Development', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injections', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Neurology', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radioactive Tracers', 'Rattus', 'Role', 'Solid', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anatomic imaging', 'animal data', 'base', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2019,196250,0.046628883626179764
"Improving Melanoma Pathology Accuracy through Computer Vision Techniques - the IMPACT Study ABSTRACT  This proposal will help to improve the accuracy of diagnosing melanoma and melanocytic lesions. The incidence of melanoma is rising faster than any other cancer, and ~1 in 50 U.S. adults will be diagnosed with melanoma this year alone. Our research team has noted substantial diagnostic errors in interpreting skin biopsies of melanocytic lesions; pathologists disagree in up to 60% of cases of invasive melanoma, which can lead to substantial patient harm. Our proposal uses computer technology to analyze whole-slide digital images of glass slides in order to improve the diagnosis of melanocytic lesions. Using data from an ongoing NIH study, we will digitize and study a set of 240 skin biopsy cases that includes a full spectrum of benign to invasive melanoma diagnoses. Each biopsy case has a reference consensus diagnosis developed by a panel of three international experts in dermatopathology and new data will be available from 160 practicing U.S. community pathologists, providing a uniquely rich clinical database that is the largest of its kind. This project will include novel computational techniques, including the detection of both cellular-level and architectural entities, and the use of a combination of feature-based and deep neural network classifiers. Our specific aims are: 1. To detect cellular-level entities in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions. 2. To detect structural (architectural) entities in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions. 3. To develop an automated diagnosis system that can classify digitized slide images into one of five possible diagnostic classes: benign; atypical lesions; melanoma in situ; invasive melanoma stage T1a; and invasive melanoma stage ≥T1b. In our proposed study, we are innovatively using computer image analysis algorithms and machine learning. This technology has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of pathologists by providing an analytical, undeviating review to assist humans in this difficult task. Project Narrative Diagnosis of melanoma and melanocytic skin biopsy lesions is among the most challenging areas of pathology and our preliminary data shows concerning levels of errors among pathologists. Our ultimate goal is to use innovative computer image analysis and machine learning techniques to reduce diagnostic errors and save patients' lives. The first step towards this goal is a correct diagnosis of melanoma.",Improving Melanoma Pathology Accuracy through Computer Vision Techniques - the IMPACT Study,9751222,R01CA200690,"['Adult', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Caring', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Dermatopathology', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mitotic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Precancerous melanosis', 'Process', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Skin', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinical database', 'deep neural network', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'feature detection', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maltreatment', 'melanocyte', 'melanoma', 'novel', 'skin lesion', 'stem', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,373460,-0.0012755469640195576
"Machine Learning in Breast Parenchyma and Tumor Characterization for Cancer Risk Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY We propose a study of radiomic texture analysis in terms of robustness assessment and classification utility. We will introduce novel robustness metrics geared towards assessment of radiomic features in comparison across two image conditions, and apply these metrics to study feature robustness across imaging parameters and patient biology. In addressing the utility of radiomic features in cancer risk assessment, we will identify and evaluate texture signatures from mammography and tomosynthesis datasets. The field of radiomics is evolving fast, and quantitative texture analysis is being applied to a growing number of applications in medical imaging. By performing a thorough investigation of the robustness of these radiomic features to dataset heterogeneities we aim to identify the strengths and weaknesses of commonly used features to guide their implementations on future applications.  Two clinical tasks will be studied under the proposed research: 1) risk assessment and cancer prediction and 2) malignancy evaluation. Multiple modalities including tomosynthesis, mammography and MRI will be involved in studies geared towards addressing these clinical questions. An evaluation of the robustness of commonly employed radiomic features will help guide the field of medical texture analysis and contribute to meaningful conclusions in future studies throughout the field of quantitative image analysis. The first aim of the proposed research involves the proposition and evaluation of novel robustness metrics for investigations lacking a classification task. The second aim will extend the study of radiomics to investigate the utility of robust features in classification tasks and identification of texture signatures relate to biomedical characteristics. The third aim will build upon the two previous aims and culminate in the application of cutting-edge technologies in machine learning and deep learning in further promoting image processing in the field of medical physics. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate and improve the application of radiomic texture features in cancer risk assessment. We will accomplish this by evaluating the robustness of various radiomic metrics, testing the classification utility of texture features in clinical tasks, and extending current classification methods to include cutting-edge developments in machine learning technology. Careful preliminary studies have demonstrated methods for selection of robust texture features and improvement in classification tasks by emphasizing feature robustness in feature selection methodology and we therefore believe that a meticulous evaluation of the impact of imaging parameters on feature calculations will lead to overall improvement of computer-aided diagnosis and clinical translation to progress in cancer screening protocols.",Machine Learning in Breast Parenchyma and Tumor Characterization for Cancer Risk Assessment,9683697,F31CA228247,"['Address', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impact evaluation', 'Incidence', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'expectation', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'molecular subtypes', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'response', 'tomosynthesis', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2019,24304,-0.012171308746654902
"Generalizing Deep Learning Reconstruction for Free-Breathing and Quantitative MRI Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to increase the precision and resolution of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Quantitative information such as tissue relaxation parameters (e.g., T1 and T2) measure tissue function and indicate disease-related changes in the heart, liver, brain, and other organs. For instance, T1 changes can provide evidence of diffuse fibrosis in the myocardium that can signal heart disease. Quantitative maps also are reproducible, directly comparable longitudinally and across subjects, and less affected by the properties of the scanner used, when compared versus common weighted (non-quantitative) clinical imaging. But, quantitative imaging involves more complicated and time-consuming pulse sequences. To accomplish this goal, this project will develop new machine learning algorithms for high-quality parameter mapping from free-breathing data. The first aim of this project will increase parameter map resolution achievable from highly accelerated, noisy data. The proposed method will integrate existing deep cascade network-based image reconstructions with convolutional network-based blocks for super-resolution and parameter map estimation. Preliminary studies suggest these new blocks improve sharpness and mitigate artifacts in the reconstructed parameter maps. The next aim will improve the training precision of such artificial neural networks to account for the significant per-voxel nonlinear fit variability in quantitative MRI. The proposed method will reweight the loss function used for calibrating these networks by the goodness-of-fit (coefficient of determination) of the reference maps obtained from fully sampled training data. Preliminary results demonstrate that quality-aware reweighting significantly improves reconstructed image quality when working with noisy training data. Experiments will evaluate the precision of both of these innovations against existing deep-learning-based reconstructions on T1 maps obtained from pre- and post-contrast cardiac images of volunteer patients. The final aim will address motion during the acquisition by estimating and tracking nonrigid motion in the data consistency stages of the deep cascade artificial neural network architecture. Two methods are proposed: deformable motion estimation already demonstrated on compressive model-based image reconstructions, and a new “re-blurring” convolutional neural network that automatically introduces artifacts into a “clean” image to match the motion-corrupted data. Both of these methods enforce consistency between motion-affected data and a motion-free image during the reconstruction. Both methods will be validated on both cardiac and abdominal images for motion artifacts and reconstruction quality against breath-held parameter mapping acquisitions. Project Narrative Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging noninvasively measures physical properties of tissue connected to cardiovascular disease and many other conditions. Novel machine learning methods for processing data to produce higher quality maps will facilitate earlier and more accurate treatment of these diseases. This project will facilitate rapid quantitative imaging with freely breathing subjects.",Generalizing Deep Learning Reconstruction for Free-Breathing and Quantitative MRI,10007241,R56EB028254,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Balance training', 'Brain', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Fibrosis', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardium', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Weight', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'coronary fibrosis', 'data space', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'loss of function', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motion sensitivity', 'multitask', 'neural network architecture', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'physical property', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R56,2019,347527,0.031280889620240435
"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system.

"Development of an adaptive machine learning platform for automated analysis of biomarkers in biomedical images ABSTRACT Manual analysis of biomedical images by researchers and pathologists has the potential to introduce bias and error that compromise the reliability of research and clinical findings. These problems are significant barriers to delivering the most beneficial evidence-based medicine, developing effective medical treatments, and promoting confidence in scientific inquiry. Identification of biomarkers and cellular targets following microscopy requires manual analysis of biomedical images, which is time intensive, difficult, and prone to bias and errors. Unintentional bias and attentional limitations during analysis of biomarkers can underlie poor reproducibility of findings in biomedical research and potentially introduce error in clinical diagnostics. We recently developed a “beta” software package designed to improve automation and standardization of image analysis, called “PIPSQUEAK” (Perineuronal net Intensity Program for the Standardization and Quantification of Extracellular matrix Analysis Kit). Since its publication in 2016, PIPSQUEAK beta has amassed approximately 1,300 users worldwide who use it to quantify the intensity and number of perineuronal nets and other neural markers in the brain. This technology significantly increases data reliability between image raters and decreases the time required for analysis by more than 100-fold. However, PIPSQUEAK beta currently uses target detection algorithms that require high-contrast images to automatically identify neurons as clusters of bright pixels on dark backgrounds. A significant current limitation to PIPSQUEAK beta, and other available imaging programs, is that detection of biomarkers can be difficult unless image conditions are ideal. Suboptimal conditions, like high background staining, off-target structures, overlapping or clustered biomarkers, and atypical morphologies, can lead to artifacts and consequently to inaccurate results and erroneous conclusions. Here, we propose to develop a user-friendly artificial intelligence (AI) platform for the automated detection of targeted biomarkers in digital microscopy that reduces this error by learning to distinguish between true cellular biomarkers and artifacts. We propose to integrate AI capabilities into our PIPSQUEAK technology to produce an adaptive, high-throughput, biomedical image analysis platform that quickly and accurately identifies biomarker targets from bench to bedside. A key advantage is that this AI program will be user friendly and available online, making it highly accessible to basic researchers and to technicians and clinicians identifying human pathologies. Thus, successful development of our AI program has a high translational potential. The goal of this proposal is 1) to develop and validate a machine learning model that is capable of detecting common histological marker morphologies in digital microscopy, and 2) to test the feasibility of adapting our AI platform to new biomarker datasets with minimal additional supervised training. Our end goal is to advance the reliability and speed of research findings and clinical diagnoses by making this technology widely available to researchers and clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Manual analysis of biomedical images by researchers and pathologists has the potential to introduces bias and error that compromise the reliability of research and clinical findings; problems which are significant barriers to delivering the most beneficial evidence-based medicine and developing effective medical treatments.

"Low- and Zero-dose Contrast-enhanced MRI Using Deep Learning Project Summary Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are used in approximately a third of all MRI scans. The unique relaxation parameters of GBCAs create indispensable image contrast for a wide range of clinical applications, such as angiography and tumor detection. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF can be painful, cause severe disability, and even death. The risk of developing NSF prevents millions of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams. The recent identification of gadolinium deposition within the brain and body has raised additional safety concerns about the usage of GBCAs. Studies have demonstrated increased signal intensity on the unenhanced T1-weighted MR images that is correlated with previous GBCA exposure, and this gadolinium retention is independent of renal function. While initial reports focused on linear GBCAs, more recent reports show that gadolinium deposition occurs with macrocyclic GBCAs as well, albeit at lower levels. FDA has recently issued warnings about gadolinium retention following contrast-enhanced MRI, and required GBCA manufacturers to conduct human and animal studies to further assess the safety of these contrast agents. This project addresses these concerns by developing low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI using artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL). Approach: This fast-track project has two phases and three aims. Aim 1 (Phase I) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using pre-contrast images and contrast-enhanced images acquired with only 10% of standard GBCA dose. A software infrastructure will be constructed to seamlessly integrate the DL software between MR scanners and PACS. Aim 2 (Phase II) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using GBCA-free acquisitions with different image contrast. In Aim 3 (Phase II), we will clinically validate and evaluate both low-dose and zero-dose DL methods, including on patients with mild- to-moderate CKD. Non-inferiority tests and diagnostic performance of the synthesized full-dose images compared to the true full-dose images will be performed. Significance: This work will lead to safer contrast-enhanced MRI. The low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI method will benefit not only millions of patients with advanced CKD, who cannot currently undergo contrast-enhanced MRI, but many more patients with normal kidney function, who are at the risk of gadolinium retention after contrast-enhanced MRI. Project Narrative Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in MRI exams to create indispensable image contrast for monitoring treatment and investigating pathology and function. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, preventing patients with advanced chronic kidney disease from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams, as well as potential gadolinium deposition in the body and brain for patients with normal kidney function.

"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation. This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning.

"Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy Project Summary/Abstract Diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy (LR) currently relies on a qualitative interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and lacks standardization. This has led to inconsistent treatment and rising costs, while quality of life metrics have remained stagnant. To standardize the diagnosis of LR, the subjective and qualitative radiologic assessment needs to be augmented with accurate measurements of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas, two anatomical structures that are critical to the etiology of LR. However, precise measurements will require manual delineations of these regions on MRI. This is a tedious and time-consuming process that is not feasible on a daily, large-scale basis in the clinic. Deep Learning (DL) is a relatively new machine learning technique, which holds the promise of automating NF and CC segmentation. None the less, there remain several challenges to making DL-based segmentation routine in clinical practice. First, training and validating a DL model for segmentation of a given anatomical structure requires a large amount of expert annotated training data. Expert annotated data is expensive and time consuming to obtain, thus thwarting the development of quantitative imaging diagnostics for LR. To address this, we propose an expert-led manual delineation of NF and CC using de-identified MRI data extracted from UCLA's picture archiving and communications system (PACS). We expect the resulting database to contain data from over 35,000 lumbar MRI scans, with associated clinical history, demographics, and patient outcomes data. In a subset (1000) of these data, NFs and CCs will be annotated by multiple human expert raters. The consensus of these delineations will be used as ground truth segmentations to train, validate and improve our understanding of DL models. Secondly, as a part of this proposal, we aim to address several technical challenges that limit the deployment of automated image segmentation techniques to the clinic. Chief amongst these challenges is the failure of automated methodologies in the face of variation due to factors such as pathology, scanner protocol alterations, and general demographic variation. Additionally, our current understanding of DL does not allow us to categorically state the total number of expert annotated data that will be needed to train a model with a specified level of accuracy. Finally, we do not currently understand how selection of training cases for expert delineation affects generalization accuracy. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose experiments to define the relationship between DL algorithms and the cardinality of training data. We will also explore the use of unsupervised machine learning strategies, namely clustering and reinforcement learning, to understand how training data selection influences algorithmic accuracy. In summary, we propose to address data availability and technical knowledge gaps to the development of accurate DL-based techniques for automated NF and CC delineation, with a broader view to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of LR. Project Narrative Basing radiological diagnoses on a quantitative characterization of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas would greatly improve the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar radiculopathy (LR). Manual measurement of this anatomy on every clinical study is not feasible; however, deep learning- (DL) based automated methods can reliable perform this task if 1) expert annotations to train DL algorithms are available and 2) we can train DL models to work accurately despite image heterogeneity. We address these knowledge gaps by developing 1) a database containing spine MR images with expert annotation of NFs and CCs and 2) intelligent training data selection frameworks to train DL algorithms and assess their robustness to heterogeneity.",Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy,9746373,R21EB026665,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Central cord canal structure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural History', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiculopathy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Diseases', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'theories', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment optimization', 'unsupervised learning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,234000,0.019026412983861315

"A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a massive amount of clinical three-dimensional (3D) cardiac image data available today in numerous hospitals, but such data has been considerably underutilized in both clinical and engineering analyses of cardiac function. These 3D data offers unique and valuable information, allowing researchers to develop innovative, personalized approaches to treat diseases. Furthermore, using these 3D datasets as input to computational models can facilitate a population-based analysis that can be used to quantify uncertainty in treatment procedures, and can be utilized for virtual clinical trials for innovative device development. However, there are several critical technical bottlenecks preventing simulation-based clinical evaluation a reality: 1) difficulty in automatic 3D reconstruction of thin complex structures such as heart valve leaflets from clinical images, 2) computational models are constructed without mesh correspondence, which makes it challenging to run batch simulations and conduct large patient population data analyses due to inconsistencies in model setups, and 3) computing time is long, which inhibits prompt feedback for clinical use.  A potential paradigm-changing solution to the challenges is to incorporate machine learning algorithms to expedite the geometry reconstruction and computational analysis procedures. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to develop a novel computing framework, using advanced tissue modeling and machine learning techniques, to automatically process pre-operative clinical image data and predict post-operative clinical outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) intervention will serve as a testbed for the modeling methods. In Aim 1, we will develop novel shape dictionary learning (SDL) based methods for automatic reconstruction of TAVR patient aortic valves. Through the modeling process, mesh correspondence will be established across the patient geometric models. The distribution and variation of TAVR patient geometries will be described by statistical shape models (SSMs). In Aim 2, population-based FE analysis of the TAVR procedure will be conducted on thousands of virtual patient models generated by the SSMs (Aim 1). A deep neural network (DNN) will be developed and trained to learn the relationship between the TAVR FE inputs and outputs. Successful completion of this study will result in a ML-FE surrogate for TAVR analysis, combining the automated TAVR patient geometry reconstruction algorithms and the trained DNN, to provide fast TAVR biomechanics analysis without extensive re-computing of the model. Furthermore, the algorithms developed in this study can be generalized for other applications and devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current clinical image modalities can be utilized to develop patient-specific computational models to pre-operatively plan transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. However, the computational modeling and simulation processes are time-consuming, which limits clinical translatability. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to develop algorithms using machine learning techniques to rapidly process and predict TAVR computational simulation outcomes directly from clinical image data.",A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes,9706921,R01HL142036,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Extravasation', 'Feedback', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Valves', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Postoperative Period', 'Problem Sets', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Response Elements', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stents', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'calcification', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'population based', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing', 'simulation', 'speech recognition', 'time resolved data', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual clinical trial']",NHLBI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,381629,0.014605433351118231
"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",9766063,R01EB028146,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Fibrosis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Iron', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'body system', 'deep learning', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'magnetic field', 'magnetohydrodynamic', 'mathematical model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'time use', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,676760,0.002498144315302887
"IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging Project Summary This proposal requests funds to provide travel support for graduates to attend and participate in the IEEE Inter- national Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2019 conference, Venice, Italy on April 08-11, 2019. The main objective of the IEEE ISBI is to bring together researchers with interests in mathematical and computa- tional aspects of biomedical imaging, with a focus on addressing problems of significance to the development and application of imaging systems across spatial scales, from microscopy to whole-body imaging. ISBI partici- pants – on the order of 600-700 from across the world are involved in biomedical imaging research and development in academic institutions, government laboratories, or R&D departments of private companies. ISBI is co-sponsored by two IEEE societies: Signal Processing Society (SPS) and Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS), representing academia, industry, and healthcare, and considered the world's foremost societies in biomedical engineering and imaging. SPS and EMBS publish IEEE Transactions on Medical Imag- ing, Transactions on Image Processing, Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, Transactions on Computational Imaging, and IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, among others. Since incep- tion in 2002, ISBI has become the leading international conference bringing together researchers from diverse algorithmic fields, applications, modalities, and size scales, to facilitate cross-fertilization of ideas across imag- ing modalities and scales. Conference topics include physical, biological and statistical modeling, image formation and reconstruction, computational and statistical image analysis, visualization and image quality as- sessment, and artificial intelligence and machine learning for big image data. ISBI, like other IEEE SPS and EMBS conferences, requires submission and review of a 4-page paper. Peer reviews are handled by a 50-mem- ber editorial board (area editors) of leading experts in the community, who in turn assign papers to well- qualified reviewers. All oral and poster papers are published in IEEExplore as Proceedings of ISBI. If awarded, IEEE anticipates the primary impact of this R13 grant will be increased attendance of U.S.-based students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty. By offering to cover a significant portion of attendee's travel expenses, the cost-benefit ratio for attending ISBI 2019 will be extremely favorable. Furthermore, IEEE will award travel grants based on need and scientific excellence, creating opportunities for those early career researchers who have accepted papers (of which less than 50% are accepted to ISBI) and who have limited means to travel. IEEE will be particularly supportive in providing travel awards to women, under-represented groups, and persons with disabilities. Benefits can largely be summarized as “exposure” and education. ISBI provides opportunity for student exposure to many more areas of computational imaging research than generally available in her/his home institution, and concurrently provides opportunity for students to interact with leaders in the field through tutorials, plenary, oral, and poster presentations, and individual discussions.

"Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement ABSTRACT This proposal aims to develop deep learning methods to automate the extraction of morphological imaging features relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA), and total knee replacement. While, quantitative evaluation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in OA research in the clinical setting MR reports often tend to be subjective, qualitative, and the grading schemes utilized in epidemiological research are not used because they are extraordinarily time consuming and do not lend themselves to the demands of todays changing healthcare scenario. The “Big Data” challenge and opportunity facing us makes it necessary to build enabling tools (i) to automate the extraction of morphological OA imaging features, with the aim of evaluating disease progression prediction capabilities on larger sample sizes that have never been explored before; (ii) to discover latent patterns by uncovering unexplored data-driven imaging features by the application of state of the art deep learning approaches (1); (iii) combine multi-modality imaging with clinical, functional, activity, and other data to define the trajectory of joint degeneration in OA. Leveraging the power of these state of the art techniques, and with the extraordinary availability of a large datasets of annotated images; in this project, we propose to develop an automatic post-processing pipeline able to segment musculoskeletal tissues and identify morphological OA features in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), as defined by commonly used MRI grading systems. Automation of morphological grading of the tissues in the joint would be a significant breakthrough in both OA research and clinical practice. It would enable the analysis of large sample sizes, assist the radiologist/clinician in the grading of images, take a relatively short amount of time, reduce cost, and could potentially, improve classification models. The availability of automatic pipelines for the identification of morphological abnormities in MRI would drastically change clinical practice, and include semi-quantitative grades, rather than subjective impressions in radiology clinical reports. In this study, we also aim to develop a complete supervised deep learning approach to obtain data-driven representations as non-linear and semantic aggregation among elementary features able to exploit the latent information hidden in the complexity of a 3D MR images, eliminating the need for nominal grades of selected features. This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning is revolutionizing medical imaging by solving challenging problems in disease classification, progression and therapeutic response. In this project, we focus on using deep learning methodology on magnetic resonance images of the knee to study osteoarthritis prevalence, and progression. The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.!",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,9669002,R61AR073552,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cartilage', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Subchondral Cyst', 'Supervision', 'Synovitis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disease classification', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'joint destruction', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'learning strategy', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R61,2019,447173,0.03795525611768727
"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD. The developed methods respond to critical needs in the field of stone disease and will advance the ability of physicians to optimally direct patient therapy and scientists to phenotype research subjects. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will develop imaging techniques that can determine urinary stone composition and fragility in patients. The significance of this is that these advanced CT imaging techniques will allow physicians to more efficiently direct patient therapy and perform clinical research, potentially avoiding procedures associated with higher risk or cost.","Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques",9798875,R01EB028591,"['Affect', 'Alkalies', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calcium Oxalate', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Subjects', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ureteroscopy', 'Uric Acid', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'calcium phosphate', 'clinical investigation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'health management', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'photon-counting detector', 'prevent', 'risk minimization', 'treatment strategy']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,357486,0.006434135850559109
"Lymph Node Quantification System for Multisite Clinical Trials Project Summary / Abstract In patients with lymphomas and other cancers, quantitative evaluation of the extent of tumor burden is im- portant for staging, restaging, and assessment of therapeutic response or relapse; yet measurement of overall tumor burden is challenging with current tools, particularly when lymph nodes are confluent or difficult to fully differentiate from surrounding structures. Precision medicine and novel therapeutics are emphasizing the need to introduce a risk-adapted approach to tailor appropriate treatment strategies for cancer patients. The ability to quantitatively assess cancer phenotypes with functional and anatomical imaging that could efficiently and ac- curately map patients to gene expression profiling, clinical information, matching cohorts, and novel treatment regimens could potentially result in more optimal management of patients with cancer.  This Academic-Industry Partnership aims to translate recently developed technologies for semi- automated image segmentation and quantification of lymph nodes into robust tools and integrate them into an existing cloud-based system for management of multicenter oncology clinical trials. The ability to semi- automatically segment lymph node pathology with computed tomography (CT), as well as quantify nodal me- tabolism with positron emission tomography (PET) will enable comprehensive tracking of morphological and functional changes related to disease progression and treatment response.  Since 2004, the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center's (DF/HCC) Tumor Imaging Metrics Core (TIMC) has developed the Precision Imaging Metrics, LLC (PIM) platform to manage clinical trial image assessment workflows. Currently, there are nearly 50,000 consistently measured lymph node measurements in the TIMC database. The PIM system is used to make over 20,000 time point imaging assessments per year at eight NCI- designated Cancer Centers and aims to grow quickly by transitioning to a fully cloud-hosted system.  Given sufficient training data, state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technolo- gies can meet or even exceed human performance on specific imaging analysis tasks. Recent studies have indicated that AI-based lymph node segmentation from CT scans is nearing human performance levels, and we will extend and translate this work into a commercial tool. Specifically, our aim is to translate recent ad- vancements in AI-based segmentation into deployable services, and integrate these services into the clinical trial workflow. The proposed system will be designed to incorporate expert feedback provided by image ana- lysts and radiologists back into the ground truth dataset, allowing for continuous improvement in accuracy and clinical acceptance. We will extend our semi-automatic CT segmentation technologies to quantify lymph node metabolism in PET/CT, using lymphoma as the model disease. Integration of these technologies with PIM will provide an ongoing source of consistently measured quantitative data across a network of cancer centers. Project Narrative Advanced quantitative imaging is underutilized in oncologic clinical practice and research because the time investment entailed in manual lesion segmentation remains prohibitive. This partnership proposes to integrate machine learning based quantitative imaging tools into the existing Precision Imaging Metrics, LLC clinical trial image management system. We will use data from the centralized Tumor Imaging Metrics Core at the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center to produce ground truth training data and develop semi-automated multimodali- ty lesion analysis for patients with cancer.",Lymph Node Quantification System for Multisite Clinical Trials,9817851,R01CA235589,"['Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Goals', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Informatics', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'NCI-Designated Cancer Center', 'Nodal', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Services', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Burden', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'glucose metabolism', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'lymph nodes', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'success', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,683973,-0.03912554110190645
"Image analytics prediction of corneal keratoplasty failure Image analytics for prediction of keratoplasty failure Summary We will create specialized image analytics software for prediction of keratoplasty (penetrating, endothelial) fail- ure from specular-reflection corneal endothelial cell (EC) images. Keratoplasties are the most common tissue transplant, with roughly a 10% failure rate, leading to blindness, patient discomfort/anxiety, and repeat kerato- plasties with a higher chance for failure than the initial procedure. With successful predictive image analytics, we will be in a position to identify transplanted corneas at risk and possibly treat them more aggressively with topical corticosteroids or other measures to prevent failure. Since a functional endothelial cell (EC) layer is necessary for the active ionic-pump-driven redistribution of fluid necessary to maintain the clear cornea, EC images have been analyzed as an indicator of cornea health. The normal EC layer exhibits high cell density arranged in a predominantly regular, hexagonal array. We will build on the use of existing quantitative bi- omarkers from EC images (EC density, coefficient of variation of cell areas, and hexagonality) used to evaluate cornea health. We will compute additional image features associated with local and long-range cell disarray, image attributes relevant to keratoplasty rejection, and traditional features from computer vision. Including this combination of features will provide rich inputs to machine-learning classifiers aimed at predicting future out- comes (e.g., failure or no failure). We will apply methods to a large aggregation of well-curated data from pre- vious NIH-funded studies at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and from previous studies at the Neth- erlands Institute for Innovative Ocular Surgery (NIIOS). Our team consists of image processing experts, oph- thalmologists, and staff from the CWRU Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences and University Hospitals (UH) Eye Institute’s Cornea Image Analysis Reading Center (CIARC), which is well-known for rigor- ous, highly repeatable assessment of conventional quantitative biomarkers in a large number of multi- institutional clinical trials. Together, our goal will be to determine if this “second generation” analysis of EC im- ages can lead to prediction of keratoplasty failure. If successful, this project will lead to software which can be translated to support research and clinical practice. Narrative Our goal is to create image analytic software that will predict the risk of keratoplasty failure from readily ob- tained corneal endothelial cell images. With knowledge of eyes at risk, physicians will be able to tailor treat- ments to improve cornea transplant success, thereby very positively impacting patients’ health.",Image analytics prediction of corneal keratoplasty failure,9765316,R21EY029498,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Cell Density', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Companions', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Endothelium', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descemet&apos', 's membrane', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Intraocular lens implant device', 'Intuition', 'Keratoplasty', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Netherlands', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Noncompliance', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetrating Keratoplasty', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Pump', 'Reading', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Seminal', 'Software Framework', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Topical Corticosteroids', 'Translating', 'Transplanted tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical practice', 'data management', 'density', 'experimental study', 'hazard', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'quantitative imaging', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'success', 'validation studies', 'vision science']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,200104,0.0249888293450621
"Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC) Project Summary/Abstract The ability to access huge cohorts of patient medical records and radiology data, the emergence of ever-more detailed imaging modalities, and the availability of unprecedented computer processing power marks the pos- sibility for a new era in neuroimaging, disease understanding, and patient treatment. To unlock the full medical potential made possible by these new technologies, new algorithms and clinically-relevant techniques must be developed by close collaboration between computer scientists, physicians, and medical researchers. We are excited to propose a national resource center with the goal of finding new ways of extracting disease characteristics from advanced imaging and computation, and to make these methods available to the larger medical community through a proven methodology of world-class research, open-source software, and exten- sive collaboration. The overarching theme for this P41 renewal is the discovery and analysis of novel imaging phenotypes to characterize disease. We use the term imaging phenotypes to describe patterns or features of disease that can be detected through imaging (predominantly MRI) followed by machine learning, statistical analysis, feature detection, and correlation with other indicators of disease such as structured patient infor- mation. The three proposed Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects address this common question us- ing a variety of complementary approaches and clinical testbeds. TR&D 1 addresses microstructure of tissue, including novel imaging methods to detect tumor microstructure. TR&D 2 investigates rich spatial patterns of disease extracted from clinical imaging with a focus on cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke. Finally, TR&D 3 proposes novel image and connectivity-based features that can be correlated with a variety of diseases, with a clinical emphasis on pediatric brain development. Technical innovation will be driven by intense collaboration between the TR&Ds and key collaborators in neurosurgery, neurology, and pe- diatrics. The TR&Ds will leverage recent important developments in the fields of image acquisition, machine learning, and data science to identify and exploit novel imaging phenotypes of disease. Building on our long history of developing clinically-relevant methods, each TR&D includes a translational and clinical validation aim to ensure our work is clinically relevant and effective at meeting the driving clinical goals. NAC's proven software engi- neering, translation, and dissemination infrastructure, along with its established network of academic, medical, and industrial partners, enhance the center's value as a national resource.

"Deep radiomic decision support system for colorectal cancer Project Summary/Abstract Computer-aided detection (CADe) has been shown to increase readers’ sensitivity and reduce inter-observer variance in detecting abnormalities in medical images. However, they prompt relatively large numbers of false positives (FPs) that readers find tedious to review and, during this process, the readers can incorrectly dismiss true lesions prompted correctly to them by CADe systems. Thus, there is a demand for an advanced decision support system that would provide not only high detection sensitivity, but also high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a lesion. In this project, we propose to improve the detection specificity of CADe by deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) that can analyze the extrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the context of local anatomy, of target lesions, whereas current CADe systems consider only the intrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the shape and texture of detected lesions. Further, we can use DCNNs to provide an explanation of why a specific location was prompted by using anatomically meaningful object categories with similar-image retrieval of past diagnosed cases. In this project, we will focus on computed tomographic colonography (CTC), which is a minimally invasive screening method for early detection of colorectal lesions to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC), which is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Historically, however, only adenomas were believed to be precursors of CRC. Recent studies have revealed a molecular pathway where also serrated lesions can develop into CRC. Recent studies have indicated that CTC can detect serrated lesions accurately based upon the phenomenon called contrast coating. Thus, the goal of this project is to develop a deep radiomic decision support (DeepDES) system that leverages deep learning for providing high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of colorectal lesions, in particular, serrated lesions, and for providing diagnostic information that explains why a specific location was prompted as a lesion to assist readers in assessing detected lesions correctly. To achieve the goal, we will explore the following specific aims: (1) Develop a radiomic deep-learning (RAID) scheme for the detection of colorectal lesions, (2) develop a DeepDES system for diagnosis of detected lesions, and (3) evaluate the clinical benefit of DeepDES system. Successful development of the proposed DeepDES system will provide an advanced decision support that addresses the current concerns about CADe by yielding both high detection sensitivity and high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a target lesion. Broad adoption and use of the DeepDES system will advance the prevention and early diagnosis of cancer, and thus will ultimately reduce mortality from colorectal cancer in the United States.

"Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research Project Summary Deep learning methods are showing great promise for advancing cancer research and could potentially improve clinical decision making in cancers such as primary brain glioma, where deep learning models have recently shown promising results in predicting isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and survival in these patients. A major challenge thwarting this research, however, is the requirement for large quantities of labeled image data to train deep learning models. Efforts to create large public centralized collections of image data are hindered by barriers to data sharing, costs of image de-identification, patient privacy concerns, and control over how data are used. Current deep learning models that are being built using data from one or a few institutions are limited by potential overfitting and poor generalizability. Instead of centralizing or sharing patient images, we aim to distribute the training of deep learning models across institutions with computations performed on their local image data. Although our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, there are three key challenges to translating these methods into research practice: (1) data is heterogeneous among institutions in the amount and quality of data that could impair the distributed computations, (2) there are data security and privacy concerns, and (3) there are no software packages that implement distributed deep learning with medical images. We tackle these challenges by (1) optimizing and expanding our current methods of distributed deep learning to tackle challenges of data variability and data privacy/security, (2) creating a freely available software system for building deep learning models on multi- institutional data using distributed computation, and (3) evaluating our system to tackle deep learning problems in example use cases of classification and clinical prediction in primary brain cancer. Our approach is innovative in developing distributed deep learning methods that will address variations in data among different institutions, that protect patient privacy during distributed computations, and that enable sites to discover pertinent datasets and participate in creating deep learning models. Our work will be significant and impactful by overcoming critical hurdles that researchers face in tapping into multi-institutional patient data to create deep learning models on large collections of image data that are more representative of disease than data acquired from a single institution, while avoiding the hurdles to inter-institutional sharing of patient data. Ultimately, our methods will enable researchers to collaboratively develop more generalizable deep learning applications to advance cancer care by unlocking access to and leveraging huge amounts of multi-institutional image data. Although our clinical use case in developing this technology is primary brain cancer, our methods will generalize to all cancers, as well as to other types of data besides images for use in creating deep learning models, and will ultimately lead to robust deep learning applications that are expected to improve clinical care and outcomes in many types of cancer. Project Narrative We develop technology that will enable researchers to tap into the enormous amount of imaging data in multiple institutions to create deep learning models for cancer applications without requiring sharing of patient data. Our work will thus enable development of more robust deep learning models to improve clinical decision making in cancer than models currently built on data from single institutions. Although our focus is improving decision making in the primary brain cancer, our methods and tools are generalizable and will be broadly applicable to all cancers, with the potential for improvement in clinical care and patient health.",Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research,9827476,U01CA242879,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Brain', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Glioma', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Information Networks', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Privacy', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer type', 'care outcomes', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'learning strategy', 'molecular marker', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient privacy', 'radiologist', 'research to practice', 'software systems', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,401628,-0.012101219575282452
"Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT In the U.S., more than 600,000 knee osteoarthritis (OA)-related total knee joint replacement (TKR) cases are reported every year, exceeding $17 billion estimated direct costs annually. There is a growing need for disease- modifying therapies that prevent or delay the need for TKR. However, development of such therapies remains challenging due to the lack of objective and measurable OA biomarkers for disease progression. The course of the OA is highly variable between individuals and the OA progresses too slowly, making it difficult to identify sensitive OA biomarkers capable of capturing minor changes on the knee joint. This has slowed development of effective therapies and prevents physicians from providing the most effective advice about minimizing the need for TKR. In this project, our goal is to develop imaging biomarkers to monitor minor OA-related changes in knee joint health that lead to TKR. To achieve this goal, we will combine novel deep learning algorithms with clinical and imaging data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). The OAI dataset includes clinical data, biospecimens, radiographs, and magnetic resonance (MR) images collected over 8 years. The proposed project has three Specific Aims: (i) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from the bilateral posteroanterior fixed-flexion knee radiographs using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); (ii) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from structural and compositional MR images using 3D CNNs with RNNs combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); and (iii) to determine whether deep learning–based imaging biomarkers can act as surrogates to predict the OA progression using a subject cohort (n = 296) independent of the cohort used to identify imaging biomarkers. The proposed project will couple deep learning with diagnostic radiology to unveil key combinations of OA-relevant features directly from images with minimal user interaction. This will facilitate fast individualized assessment of OA progression using whole knee joint images directly. If successful, this study will bring new insights into the development of imaging biomarkers for OA progression and more broadly into our understanding and treatment of OA. The knowledge gained in this project will help to advance close monitoring of OA progression by opening new perspectives on the regions and parameters for potential inclusion in both intervention studies and clinical practice. NARRATIVE Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disorder of joints and is the most common reason leading to total knee joint replacement. Our proposed study aims to develop a novel automated OA-relevant imaging biomarker identification system based on radiographs, magnetic resonance images, and deep learning methods to study knee OA progression. We will address whether combining deep learning algorithms with medical images will determine the key combinations of features relevant to knee OA that are required to accurately predict the OA progression outcome.",Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis,9818000,R01AR074453,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Visit', 'arthropathies', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'tool']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,489349,0.02352617060947144
"Automatic analysis of 3D skin images for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) severity assessment Project Summary More than 20,000 hematopoietic stem cell transplants (including bone marrow transplants) are performed in the U.S. each year to cure a range of diseases ranging from leukemias to sickle cell anemia to autoimmune deficiencies in children. Unfortunately, most long-term non-relapse survivors will die of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), which remains a disease of steadily increasing incidence and profound unmet need. A fundamental barrier in cGVHD management and research is a lack of sensitive and objective assessment tools that permit objective and reproducible measures of disease severity and progression. Skin is the most commonly affected organ in cGVHD and automated techniques capable of measuring precisely the surface area of involved skin in photographs may provide the tools necessary for effectively evaluating patient progress. We propose to (1) create the data set necessary to develop machine learning-based methods for the automatic analysis of cGVHD images, and (2) implement and evaluate these methods. Project Narrative  Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a lethal disease that affects most long-term hematopoietic stem cell transplant (including bone marrow transplants) recipients. Skin images are used to assess disease severity and progression but the technology required to quantitatively and reproducibly analyze these images is lacking.

"Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers Project Summary Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) has been proposed as a technique to quantify tissue parameters, such as T1 and T2 relaxation times, which are biomarkers for various pathologies. One assumption of MRF is that the signal in each voxel is generated by exactly one set of tissue parameters. Due to MRI resolution at the range of millimeter in combination with the cellular structure of biological tissue, each voxel consists of multiple tissue compartments. An over-simplified single compartment model results in apparent relaxation times that are influenced by the relaxation times and the fractional proton densities of all contributing compartments. This can lead to a misinterpretation of signal changes. For example, in diseases that causes demyelination in white matter (Multiple Sclerosis, Dementia), a reduction of the myelin water fraction would result in a misleading change of the apparent relaxation time of the voxel. We propose a multi-compartment MRF method that allows to identify multiple tissue contributions within a voxel, including the fractional proton density (PD) of different compartments. Our machine learning based approach automatically identifies the number of compartments within each voxel that can be identified with the available SNR in that voxel. We will correct for partial-volume effects at the borders of two types of tissues, as well as analyze tissue microstructure. For the second case our learned model will also include chemical exchange between compartments. After an initial validation phase using numerical simulations, we will first perform MRF scans of dedicated 3D printed phantoms with multiple compartments. Our quality criterion is successful estimation of all simulated tissue compartments for all voxels with a relative error of less than 5% to the ground truth. We will then perform in-vivo MRF measurements of healthy volunteers (n=5). We will generate synthetic FLAIR and MP-RAGE contrasts from parameter maps estimated with conventional and the proposed multi-compartment MRF technique. We will compare them with currently used clinical contrasts acquired using established pulse sequences and validate the performance of our approach by measuring the cortical thickness. Further, we will validate the performance for microstructure composition in white matter. Our hypothesis is that it will be possible separate the compartments for myelin, intra- and extra-cellular water and compare the results to ex-vivo data found in literature. In summary, the methods developed in this R21 proposal will provide a novel technique to accurately and reproducibly identify biomarkers beyond the resolution of a voxel. It will allow to identify changes in tissue composition and fractional proton density at the microstructure level. Project Narrative The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish a MR imaging technique for quantifying biomarkers at the sub-voxel level. We will develop a machine learning based MR fingerprinting image reconstruction that enables the identification and characterization of multiple compartments within a voxel in terms of fractional proton density and relaxation times. We will generate accurate synthetic fluid suppressed images such as the FLAIR and MP- RAGE with accurate partial volume behavior and analyze the myelin water fraction and the corresponding relaxation times in white matter.",Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers,9825278,R21EB027241,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fingerprint', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'gray matter', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'millimeter', 'neuroimaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'physical process', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tissue biomarkers', 'white matter']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2019,209851,0.008687106524094787
"Neuroinformatics platform using machine learning and content-based image retrieval for neuroscience image data This project aims to develop NeuroManager™, an innovative neuroinformatics platform for advanced parsing, storing, aggregating, analyzing and sharing of complex neuroscience image data. A core technology that we will develop in NeuroManager will be Image Content Analysis for Retrieval Using Semantics (ICARUS), a novel, intelligent neuroimage curation system that will enable image retrieval based on visual appearance or by semantic concept. ICARUS will use machine learning applied to content-based image retrieval - (CBIR) to build and refine models that summarize microscopic and macroscopic image appearance and automatically assign semantic concepts to neuroimages. Neuroscience research generates extensive, multifaceted data that is considerably under-utilized because access to original raw data is typically maintained by the source lab. On the other hand, there are many advantages in sharing complex image data in neuroscience research, including the opportunity for separate analysis of raw data by other scientists from another perspective and improved reproducibility of scientific studies and their results. Unfortunately, none of the neuroscience data sharing options that exist today fulfill all the needs of neuroscientists. To solve this problem, NeuroManager will include the following distinct, significant innovations: (i) versatility for handling two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional neuroimaging data sets from animal models and humans; (ii) functionality to share complex datasets that extends secure, privacy-controlled paradigms from institutional, laboratory-based and even public domains; (iii) flexibility to implement NeuroManager within an institute’s IT infrastructure, or on most cloud-based virtualized environments including Azure, Google Cloud Services and Amazon Web Services; (iv) and most importantly, the ICARUS technology for CBIR in neuroimaging data sets. The benefit of NeuroManager for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be to foster collaboration between scientists and institutions, promoting innovation through combined expertise in an interdisciplinary atmosphere. This will open new horizons for better understanding the neuropathology associated with several human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions at various levels (i.e., macroscopically, microscopically, subcellularly and functionally), ultimately leading to an improved basis for developing novel treatment and prevention strategies for complex brain diseases. In Phase I we will prove feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype software that will perform CBIR on 2D whole slide images of coronal sections of entire mouse brains from ongoing research projects of our collaborators. Work in Phase II will focus on developing the commercial software product that will include all of the innovations mentioned above. A competing technology with comparable functionality, addressing the full breadth of needs for modern neuroscience research, is currently not available commercially or otherwise. There are many advantages in sharing complex image data in neuroscience research, including the opportunity for separate analysis of raw data by other scientists from another perspective and improved reproducibility of scientific studies and their results; however none of the neuroscience data sharing options that exist today fulfill all the needs of neuroscientists. This project commercializes an innovative software for sophisticated advanced parsing, storing, aggregating, analyzing and sharing of complex neuroscience image data, including a novel, intelligent neuroimage curation system that will enable content-based neuroscience image search powered by machine learning, thereby opening new horizons in neuroscience research collaborations. This system will allow researchers to make new discoveries based on new studies that are currently not feasible, ultimately providing the basis for developing novel treatments to prevent and fight complex brain diseases.",Neuroinformatics platform using machine learning and content-based image retrieval for neuroscience image data,9797689,R44MH118815,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Model', 'Appearance', 'Archives', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Chicago', 'Cloud Service', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Files', 'Data Provenance', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Dimensions', 'Fostering', 'Human', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Prevention strategy', 'Privacy', 'Problem Solving', 'Production', 'Public Domains', 'Records', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Subjects', 'Retrieval', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Semantics', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cloud based', 'collaborative environment', 'data access', 'data format', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'fighting', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuropathology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional', 'usability', 'virtual reality', 'web services', 'whole slide imaging']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R44,2019,748584,0.015806307760106473
"Ultraportable Stroke CT Based on Stationary Carbon Nanotube X-ray Source and Deep Learning Image Formation PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this 12-month SBIR phase 1 project is developing an imaging device that will enable highly efficient and cost-effective stroke imaging for patients suffered trauma events. The expected technical outcome will be a proof-of-concept head CT imaging system with sub- second imaging speed, sub-mSv radiation dose, and high-quality images. Imaging systems with such capabilities will address the current deficiency in timely diagnosis of stroke patients, and benefit society with higher efficiency and lower cost. Such imaging device will make a strong economic impact on the global head CT imaging market, which is estimated to be about $36 billion in the U.S. In a longer term, the novel imaging technology could be translated into markets for security screening, industry inspection, and dental imaging. This project is based on the recent research results by Dr. Cao's team under the support of an NSF CAREER award (PI Dr. Cao, 08/01/2014-07/31/2019, $400,000) and a Dr. Cao's Commonwealth Research Commercialization Fund (CRCF) award (Title: “Computed Tomography Without Moving Parts for Fast and Portable Biomedical Imaging”, 07/01/2017- 06/30/2019, $100,000). The project has a strong footing in intellectual property. The technology is protected by a few patent applications at the Virginia Tech, including US. 62/316649, “Ultrafast Micro-CT for Imaging Free-Moving Animals” (Inventor: Guohua Cao), and PCT/US2013/061049 and US14/429835, “System and Method of Stationary Source Computed Tomography” (Inventor: Guohua Cao, et. al.). In this project, the team will design and build a proof-of-concept head CT platform to test the feasibility of ultraportable and compact head CT based on the stationary carbon nanotube x-ray source design and deep learning image reconstruction algorithm. The expected outcomes from this project include demonstration of the feasibility for ultrafast, low dose, and diagnostic imaging capabilities for intracerebral hemorrhage in head phantoms (ICH), with potential automatic ICH identification through deep learning algorithm. A ready-to- prototype head CT device will be optimized and designed, and a corresponding business plan will be developed. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a common of death in the world at tremendous social and healthcare costs. Currently head CT is typically used for initial evaluation of stroke patients for signs of intracerebral hemorrhage. An ultraportable stroke CT that can be mounted in a small minivan would significantly shorten the time it takes for the diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage, particularly from trauma incidents.

"31st Annual International MR Angiography Conference Project Summary The objective of the 31st Annual Workshop on Magnetic Resonance Angiography is to provide a forum for scientists and scientist-clinicians, clinical staff and industry interested in MR angiography techniques. The Workshop is the annual meeting of the Society for Magnetic Resonance Angiography (SMRA). At this meeting, emerging techniques and exciting new applications to visualize the vascular system, measure and display blood flow and improve patient outcomes will be presented. MR angiography is an important clinical tool that is applied to millions of patients annually and accounts for an estimated 10% of all MR procedures. Recent advances in time-resolved imaging, non-contrast imaging, post-processing techniques, flow measurements, and flow visualization, as well other innovations, continue to make MRA a dynamic, cutting-edge area of interest for scientific investigation. A major goal of this SMRA Workshop is to provide scientists, clinicians, and students with the opportunity to build connections, pool their knowledge, and educate each other in order to accelerate the refinement of MRA technology and critically how to apply it in clinical practice. Topics for the MRA Workshop will include: vascular disease mechanisms, vessel wall and plaque imaging, quantification of blood flow dynamics, applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning, MRA of the brain, heart, abdomen, and extremities; contrast agents, cardiac MR, assessment of cardiac structure and function, clinical study design, new MRA techniques, MRI of implanted devices, technology assessment, comparing MRI with other imaging modalities and critically translating advanced MRA techniques into day-to- day clinical practice. The 3-day workshop will be preceded by an informative one-day educational program that will include both fundamental and advanced lectures from international experts in the field. These topics and educational objectives of the 31st Annual Workshop on Magnetic Resonance Angiography are directly related to the NHLBI mission to provide global leadership for research, training, and education to promote the prevention and treatment of heart and blood diseases. The scientific presentations will include new discoveries about the causes of disease and as such contribute to the translation of basic discoveries into clinical practice. In addition, the proposed educational activities as well as discussion among participants will foster training and mentoring of emerging scientists and physicians. In this context, the workshop will support a collaborative research infrastructure, including participants from academic institutions and industry.

"SCH:Smartphone Wound Image Parameter Analysis and Decision Support in Mobile Env PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Chronic wounds affect 6.5 million patients in the U.S., with an estimated treatment cost of $25 billion. Our team proposes research to advance our existing NSF-funded smartphone wound analysis system, which helps patients monitor their diabetic foot ulcers, providing them with instant feedback on healing progress. Our wound system analyzes a smartphone image of the patients' wound, detects the wound area and tissue composition, and generates a proprietary healing score by comparing the current image with a past image. Our envisioned chronic wound assessment system will support evidence-based decisions by the care team while visiting patients, and move wound care toward digital objectivity. We define digital objectivity as the synthesis of wound assessment metrics that are extracted autonomously from images in order to generate objective actionable feedback, enabling clinicians not trained as wound specialists to deliver ""standardized wound care"". Digital objectivity contrasts with the current practice of subjective, visual inspection of wounds based on physician experience. The first aim will develop image processing algorithms to mitigate wound analysis errors caused by non-ideal lighting in some clinical or home settings, and when the wound is photographed from arbitrary camera angles and distance. While our previous wound system worked well in ideal conditions, non-ideal lighting caused large errors and healthy skin was detected as the wound area in extreme cases. The second aim extends our existing wound analysis system that targets only diabetic wounds to handle arterial, venous and pressure ulcers, expanding the potential user. The third aim will synthesize algorithms that autonomously generate actionable wound decision rules that are learned from decisions taken by actual wound clinicians. This research is joint work of Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) (technical expertise in image processing, machine learning and smartphone programming) and University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) (clinical expertise on wounds, and wound patient recruitment to validate our work) RELEVANCE (See instructions): We propose research to advance our existing smartphone wound analysis system, which detects the wound area and tissue composition, and generates a proprietary healing score from a wound image.

"Multi-Scale 3-D Image Analytics for High Dimensional Spatial Mapping of Normal Tissues PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop open-source software and algorithms for 3-D reconstruc- tion and multi-scale mapping of normal tissues. Another significant goal is to evaluate effects of aging and envi- ronmental factors on molecular and structural architecture of skin. We will leverage our mature (TRL8) technol- ogy for multiplexed 2-D imaging (Cell DIVE™), and our vast experience in 2-D image analytics and machine learning. We have selected normal skin as the organ to develop these tools for several reasons, a) clinical sam- ples from different age groups are more readily available, b) it is a good model to independently capture changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) due to age and normal exposure to environmental factors as well as a variety of pathogenic insults. While the ECM, cellular and intracellular molecular composition varies considerably among various organs, we believe many of the tools developed under this program will be applicable to reconstruct and map other organ models at high (cellular/subcellular) resolution. This proposal will focus on developing algo- rithms and a framework for multi-scale mapping of 3-D tissue images, which will address HuBMAP priorities around quantitative 3-D image analysis/mapping, including automated 3-D image segmentation, feature ex- traction, and image annotation. High-resolution (subcellular) mapping of biomolecules will be implemented us- ing 2-D multiplexed images that are used to reconstruct the 3-D tissue and linked to a lower resolution 3-D opti- cal coherence tomography (OCT) image of the normal tissue. Other cell-level omic data (e.g., RNA FISH) will be mapped in the same way. The low-resolution image is mapped back to a higher-level landmark (e.g., organ) as defined by the HuBMAP common coordinate framework (CCF). As outlined, our proposed technologies will in- clude several key features that are significant and complimentary to existing HuBMAP consortium projects and will advance the state of the art in 3-D tissue analysis. The proposed algorithms will have several key innova- tions that will advance the state of the art in 3-D multiplexed tissue image analysis. First, given the large vol- umes to be analyzed, high throughput will be a key requirement of each image analysis algorithm. This will be supported by our extensive experience in parallelizing single cell analysis pipelines. Second, the proposed algo- rithms will segment the images at multiple scales. The third area of innovation will focus on efficient multi- channel analysis. The proposed project will include creation of an easy-to-use software tool for assembling and visualizing multiscale tissue data called Tissue Atlas Navigation Graphical Overview (TANGO). PROJECT NARRATIVE Composition and organization of cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) they are embedded in, controls the function of different organs in human body. Alterations in any of these can lead to onset and progression of var- ious diseases.

"Plaque Risk Stratification Using Routinely Available CCTA to Optimize Therapeutic Decision-making in Patients with Known or Suspected Coronary Artery Disease Project Summary/Abstract New treatments have been revolutionary in improving outcomes over the last 30 years, yet cardiovascular disease still exerts a $320B annual burden on the US economy. Increasing evidence is showing that Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides. Currently available solutions do not overcome the barriers – a new approach is needed. Elucid Bioimaging has developed an image analysis software product vascuCAP (CAP stands for Computer Aided Phenotyping) to accurately quantify structural and morphological characteristics of plaque tissues linked to plaque rupture vulnerability. Fundamental to our approach is validated, objective quantitative accuracy; vascuCAP enjoys the most robust and well documented analytic validation of any plaque morphology software available. vascuCAP is the only system to mitigate specific issues in CT reconstruction known to effect accurate measurement of atherosclerotic plaque composition in routinely acquired CTA; it is the only system to effectively leverage objective tissue characterization validated by histology across multiple arterial beds; it achieves an effective resolution with routinely acquired CTA in the same ballpark as IVUS VH, based on solid mathematics principles that respect the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem; and it innovates by novel reporting that expresses the findings in a manner that fits efficiently into existing clinical workflows. vascuCAP has been implemented in a client-server model supporting SaaS. Working from our strong current device clearances, this research strategy is developed based on approved meeting notes from the FDA pre-submission process Phenotype classification claims to be cleared through direct De Novo pathway on the basis of accurately determining the class from in vivo CTA data relative to pathologist annotation on ex vivo specimen data. Risk prediction claims: validate ability to predict adverse events at one year, adding the IFU according to the direct De Novo pathway, One does not strictly depend on the other.This proposal is innovative in dealing with two fundamental limitations of the application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to the analysis of atherosclerosis imaging data. This proposal maximizes use of available retrospective data while putting in place the necessary structure for prospective validation and scale up. This proposal further develops vascuCAP as a tool that may reduce cost and length of clinical trials. While out of scope for this grant, it is important to also note that vascuCAP is innovative in its ability to support multi-scale modeling across cellular/molecular-level analyses and macroscopic manifestation. Also, vascuCAP’s quantitative ability makes it ideal for analysis of more advanced CT imaging protocols. These attributes complement and support the proposed objectives. Project Narrative Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease.

"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and . These activities will be targeted at both XNAT users and developers. RELEVANCE Medical imaging is one of the key methods used by biomedical researchers to study human biology in health and disease.

"Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is exceptionally common, with an estimated one hundred million afflicted people in the United States. Detection and risk stratification of this very common disease remains a major challenge. Despite recent advances, including development of numerous therapeutic agents presently in phase 2 and 3 trials, NAFLD remains a silent disease in which the vast majority of patients accumulate progressive liver damage without signs or symptoms and, undiagnosed, receive no medical care. The NAFLD patients at highest risk of cirrhosis are those with moderate or greater liver fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, a group of patients who are described as having high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH). The current reference standard for identifying people with hrNASH is liver biopsy, which is expensive, invasive, and limited by interobserver variability. The focus of this project is to develop and validate low cost non-invasive diagnostic technology to diagnose hrNASH. We propose to accomplish this in three Specific Aims. First, we will expand and annotate an existing database of patients with chronic liver disease from 328 subjects to 1,000 subjects, ~40% of whom will have NAFLD. The database will contain ~20,000 images (~10,000 ultrasound elastography images and ~ 10,000 conventional ultrasound images) and multiple demographic and clinical data points for each subject (a total of ~30,000 clinical, laboratory, and demographic data points). We have previously developed advanced image processing techniques to make ultrasound elastography more accurate and less variable. We will use this large database to develop, customize and refine our image processing techniques for NAFLD evaluation (Aim 1), with the goal of improving ultrasound elastography diagnosis of hrNASH. Second, we will combine conventional ultrasound elastography imaging, conventional ultrasound imaging, our advanced image analysis techniques, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data in a machine learning model to predict hrNASH and will compare the performance of our predictive model with the FIB4, a widely-used blood test-based prediction rule (Aim 2). Third, we will validate our predictive model in an independent prospective cohort of NAFLD subjects undergoing biopsy for NAFLD risk stratification (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the combination of image processing-enhanced elastography and conventional ultrasound imagery combined with demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will have greater predictive power for hrNASH than clinical or sonographic data alone. The proposed predictive models have the potential to (1) reduce the number of liver biopsies performed for hrNASH detection, (2) facilitate recruitment for clinical trials of NAFLD therapeutics, and (3) improve care quality for the most common liver disease in the United States. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to create low-cost non-invasive technology to diagnose people with high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH), a common liver disease that has a high risk of cirrhosis. We will accomplish this goal by improving liver ultrasound imaging and by creating a prediction tool that integrates liver ultrasound, laboratory testing and clinical information. This prediction tool has the potential to reduce the need for liver biopsies.","Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD",9640524,R01DK119860,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Caring', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II/III Trial', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective cohort', 'Quality of Care', 'ROC Curve', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic liver disease', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'disorder subtype', 'elastography', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'liver injury', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,462750,0.01470070804967738
"Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI Project Summary/Abstract Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) provides arguably the most comprehensive evaluation of the cardiovascular system; however, respiratory motion continues to adversely impact CMR, causing artifacts that lead to poor image quality, repeated scans, and decreased throughput, and thus represents a significant obstacle to clinical utility. For single-shot CMR, cardiac and breathing motions are “frozen” by limiting the acquisition to an end-diastolic window less than 200 ms. For first pass perfusion, breathing motion cannot be eliminated because data from 50 to 60 consecutive heartbeats are required to capture contrast dynamics. For other single-shot applications such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and parameter mapping, respiratory motion is introduced when the acquisition is repeated across several heartbeats to improve spatial and temporal resolution. To eliminate respiratory motion from single-shot images, non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) has been promoted as an attractive option that provides 100% acquisition efficiently. MOCO can be used either after the reconstruction or during the reconstruction. Such techniques, however, cannot account for through-plane motion, which can only be corrected prospectively, and can fail depending on image quality and the extent of motion. Prospective compensation of the respiratory motion has been recognized as an attractive alternative to existing gating and MOCO methods. Proposed methods use one or more navigator echoes—incompatible with or inefficient for many CMR protocols—to capture the respiratory motion and rely on simple parametric models that are inadequate to describe complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion. Due to these limitations, prospective methods have found limited applicability even in research settings. We propose a new framework to prospectively compensate respiratory motion. The proposed method, called PROspective Motion compensation using Pilot Tone (PROMPT), employs Pilot Tone technology and leverages machine learning principles to first learn complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion on a patient-specific basis and then prospectively compensate the motion by tracking the imaging plane, in real time, as a function of a Pilot Tone based respiratory signal. If successful, this synergistic combination of Pilot Tone and machine learning will lead to 100% efficiency for single-shot CMR exams performed under free-breathing conditions, will eliminate the need to setup navigator echoes, respiratory bellows, or other inefficient prospective gating measures, will minimize through-plane motion that can render the images non-diagnostic for CMR applications including fast-pass perfusion, parameter mapping, LGE, and coronary angiography, will provide a reliable surrogate measure of respiratory motion, and will facilitate highly accelerated compressive recovery. Project Narrative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many potential advantages over currently used imaging methods to diagnose heart disease, but MRI images can be ruined if the patient breathes during the scan. In this project, we will develop a method that is insensitive to breathing motion and compare it to existing methods. These efforts should lead to significant improvements in diagnosis of heart disease so that patients may benefit from appropriate treatment.",Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI,9762101,R21EB026657,"['Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Gadolinium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'healthy volunteer', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,223680,-0.014864456658953024
"Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) Overall Project Summary  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) pursues a mission of bringing people together to create new ways of seeing. The work of our Center has been focused on creating new paradigms for the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of biomedical images, and on implementing new collaboration models in order to translate these developments rapidly into clinical practice.  The world of biomedical imaging is changing, and CAI2R has been at the forefront of that change. Tasks that were once the sole domain of meticulously-engineered imaging hardware are now beginning to be accomplished in software, increasingly informed by diverse arrays of inexpensive auxiliary sensors. Information once pursued through the laborious acquisition of carefully separated image datasets is now being derived from newly integrated, and richly quantitative, data streams. In keeping with these themes, our Center will be organized around the following four Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects going forward: 1. Reimagining the Future of Scanning: Intelligent image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. 2. Unshackling the Scanners of the Future: Flexible, self-correcting, multisensor machines. 3. Enriching the Data Stream: MRI and PET in concert. 4. Revealing Microstructure: Biophysical modeling and validation for discovery and clinical care.  In each of these projects, we aim to push medical imaging technology to the next level, both in hardware and in software. Having made great strides in developing rapid, continuous imaging data streams, we will next aim to add key new information to those streams, both from physics-driven microstructural modeling and from data- driven machine learning. Having focused on the development of robust tools for image acquisition and reconstruction, we will extend the pipeline to image interpretation, using the results of human- or machine- derived evaluations of image content as feedback for the further improvement of acquisition strategies and sensor designs. We will also aim to close the loop between diagnostic sensing and therapeutic intervention, exploring new ways to guide therapy with continuously-acquired information about tissue bioeffects.  Our Center has an explicit translational focus, which is reflected in the day-to-day operation of TR&D projects as well as in the topics of Collaborative Projects (CPs) and Service Projects (SPs), which are focused on three general areas of high public health impact: cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and neurologic disease.  In keeping with this translational emphasis, CAI2R is also be driven by an embedded collaboration model in which basic scientists, clinicians, and industry developers sit down together regularly at the scanners for interactive technology development and assessment. With early involvement of clinical stakeholders and industry partners, we aim to make CAI2R technologies widely available, for the advancement of biomedical knowledge and for the benefit of patients and the physicians who care for them. Overall Project Narrative  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) develops novel imaging techniques and technologies for the improved diagnosis and management of cancer, musculoskeletal disease, neurological disease and other disorders with a profound impact on human health. By exploiting connections between imaging modalities such as MRI and PET, we aim to advance the fundamental capabilities of each, so as to expand biomedical knowledge and improve the care of patients.",Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R),9804438,P41EB017183,"['Adopted', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagination', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Industrial Product', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Philosophy', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Stream', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'bioimaging', 'biophysical model', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'flexibility', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'imaging scientist', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel imaging technique', 'off-patent', 'open source', 'operation', 'radio frequency', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'technology research and development', 'tool', 'web site']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P41,2019,1715698,0.04408525981127474
"Innovations in cervical cancer diagnosis for low resource settings using advanced optical imaging and machine learning diagnostic algorithms. The broad goal of this project is to adapt a portable, low-cost, easy-to-use Pocket-sized Colposcope (developed under other funding) for use in a community setting, and develop automated algorithms that combine neovascularization, glycogen depletion and acetowhitening to provide comparable diagnosis to an expert. This work will be done in a collaboration between 3rd Stone Design, Inc, Duke University and Kenya Medical Research Institute. The specific aims of this proposal are:  Aim 1 (Phase I): Improve Pocket colposcope by designing continuous magnification mechanism and improving device workflow integration to eliminate between-use disinfection through the use of a disposable optically clear sterile sleeve. Provider feedback on our previously developed Pocket colposcope has unanimously suggested the addition of a slider mechanism to control coarse zoom and a sleeve consumable to the Pocket colposcope design.  Aim 2 (Phase I): Automated algorithms and software for cervical pre-cancer detection We will improve the specificity of VIA using a novel software application with embedded machine learning diagnostic algorithms for automated cervical cancer screening. We will apply and validate the individual algorithms for VIA and GIVI (green illumination vascular imaging) to existing images obtained from a 200-patient clinical study with the Pocket colposcope. We will then compare the performance of the algorithms to expert physician interpretation of the same images, with pathology serving as the gold standard.  Aim 3 (Phase II): Document user experience with Pocket colposcope in Kenya. We will develop a culturally relevant training package directly in the community healthcare setting. We will collect quantitative and qualitative data including surveys, in-depth interviews, and clinic observations from both naive providers and patients and use these findings to and use these findings to improve the introduction of the Pocket colposcope in Kenya and simultaneously, inform the clinical investigations in Aim 4.  Aim 4 (Phase II): Compare the performance of the Pocket colposcope to Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid for triage of HPV+ women in Kenya. We will carry out a cluster-randomized trial among 400 HPV+ women to compare the standard triage with that using the Pocket colposcope in Kisumu, Kenya. All HPV+ women will undergo biopsy to determine sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of the different triage strategies. Data will be used to model the performance of the algorithm against that of expert colposcopists.  Aim 5 (Phase II): Assess the costs, incremental cost-effectiveness and population health impact of HPV-based cervical cancer screening programs with proposed triage strategies. We will determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and the absolute and relative costs for four triage strategies by measuring the costs and model population health outcomes (cancer cases, deaths and disability adjusted life years). NARRATIVE The SBIR activities proposed by 3rd Stone Design and Duke University will advance the state of the art in cervical cancer imaging through the R&D of novel optics for a portable colposcope combined with automated algorithms for diagnosis. The project will confirm the benefits of these innovations through a clinical trial in Kenya conducted by the Kenya Medical Research Institutes. The innovations developed have tremendous potential to effect public health by increasing diagnostic acuity and decreasing costs of healthcare delivery which ultimately will reduce the impact of the deadly disease.",Innovations in cervical cancer diagnosis for low resource settings using advanced optical imaging and machine learning diagnostic algorithms.,9778122,R44CA240019,"['Acetic Acids', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Back', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cessation of life', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Colposcopes', 'Colposcopy', 'Community Health', 'Community Healthcare', 'Computer software', 'Cost Analysis', 'Cost Measures', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disinfection', 'Feedback', 'Fogs', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Glycogen', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Interview', 'Kenya', 'Lesion', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Medical Research', 'Modeling', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Sledding', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Sterility', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Vagina', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness ratio', 'design', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'incremental cost-effectiveness', 'innovation', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mortality', 'neovascularization', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'overtreatment', 'point of care', 'population health', 'portability', 'primary care setting', 'relative cost', 'research and development', 'screening', 'screening program']",NCI,CALLA HEALTH FOUNDATION,R44,2019,299992,-0.014069683521021446
"Application of Advanced Quantitative Methods to Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia PROJECT SUMMARY  Abnormalities of white matter are important in schizophrenia. A preponderance of studies have found decreased levels of transcripts for myelin-related proteins in autopsy brains. Some have found decrease in the proteins themselves, and some have not. Hundreds of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have found reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the brains of many people with schizophrenia (SCH). Decreased FA is interpreted as disruption of normal architecture. However, postmortem examination has failed to identify characteristic abnormalities. This suggests that abnormalities are subtle, and perhaps postmortem examinations have not used the right tools to find them. We have therefore been developing, as part of a collaboration supported by our concluding Fogarty project, two new methods to characterize white matter at high resolution. The first is a machine learning protocol to measure axonal diameters and myelin sheath thickness in electron microscope (EM) images of prefrontal white matter, recognizing and avoiding artifacts in EM of autopsy tissue. This will enable us to measure thousands of fibers in EM images produced as part of our concluding Fogarty project, from individuals with SCH, major depressive disorder (MDD), or no psychiatric illness (NPI). The second method, suggested by the DTI findings, is to analyze the arrangement of the axons themselves. We will use 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of high-resolution images of the axons themselves, identified by Bielschowsky silver stain or immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated neurofilament protein. To obtain high-resolution images of Bielschowsy stains, we will take advantage of the recent observation by Dr. Mark Sonders, co-investigator on this project, that these and other heavy metal stains luminesce under 2-photon infrared excitation. This yields clear and measurable images of individual axons. We will perform these procedures on sections from existing paraffin blocks that comprise a complete left prefrontal coronal section from 36 triads containing 1 case each of SCH, MDD, or NPI, matched for sex and age. These brains were included in earlier studies that yielded data on protein composition, mRNA for myelin-related proteins, DNA methylation, microglial activation, and semiquantitative myelin histology. In a third, exploratory aim, we will employ graphical models to combine these various types of data with known properties of CNS white matter and myelin to build a model of what is disturbed in schizophrenia. We expect that novel techniques for data fusion will reveal associations based on multidimensional correlations that could not be detected by modeling the single-domain datasets separately. In the process of completing these scientific aims, we will pursue the pedagogic goals of training the first two professional biostatisticians in Macedonia, and an academic pathologist. We will also hold a seminar course for biological researchers to build awareness and understanding of the power of biostatistical and other computational methods to enrich their research. NARRATIVE Our ongoing Fogarty/NIMH research project in Macedonia (R01 MH060877, “Building Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia”), has demonstrated biochemical abnormalities of white matter in schizophrenia that are not present in major depressive disorder. However, we have not seen anatomical abnormalities of white matter, which MRI studies of schizophrenia tell us should exist, and as the biochemistry also suggests. To explore white matter in novel ways, we are developing new methods of microscopy, image analysis and statistical inference, which we now propose to employ on a large scale.",Application of Advanced Quantitative Methods to Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia,9953486,R56MH117769,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academy', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Autopsy', 'Awareness', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscope', 'Electrons', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Macedonia', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Myelin', 'Myelin Sheath', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurofilament Proteins', 'Paraffin', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Silver Staining', 'Stains', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translational Research', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'deep neural network', 'diffusion anisotropy', 'high resolution imaging', 'histological image', 'histological studies', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'interest', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pedagogy', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy', 'two-photon', 'water diffusion', 'white matter']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R56,2019,10000,-0.015667441905085067
"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9782996,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,348107,0.0028303100120678926
"Auto-Scope Software-Automated Otoscopy to Diagnose Ear Pathology ABSTRACT Acute infections of the middle ear (acute otitis media - AOM), are the most commonly treated childhood disease. Treatment is fueled by concern for complications and effects on children's cognitive and language development. The financial burden of AOM is estimated at more than $5 billion per year. Because AOM is so common, a major societal problem is the over-diagnosis and over-treatment of this disease, as a result of two factors: First, accurately diagnosing AOM is difficult, even for experienced primary care or ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physicians. Second, with a growing shortage of primary care physicians in the US, more Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants serve as first-line clinicians in primary care settings, but lack extensive training in otoscopy (i.e. clinical examination of the eardrum). Consequently, practitioners often err on the side of making a diagnosis of AOM and prescribing oral antibiotics. Over 8 million unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed annually, contributing to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and creating the largest number of pediatric medication-related adverse events. Many children with inaccurate diagnoses of AOM are referred to ENTs for surgical placement of ear tubes, and up to 70% of these cases are not indicated. Diagnosing AOM still depends on clinician subjectivity, based on a brief glimpse of the eardrum. This diagnostic subjectivity creates a critical barrier to progress in society's goal of decreasing healthcare costs and reducing over-diagnosis and over-treatment of AOM. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2013, devices are needed to assist in more accurate, consistent, and objective diagnosis of AOM. A simple and objective method of analyzing an image of a patient's ear to diagnose or rule out AOM would drastically reduce over-treatment. This project will fill that gap, by developing computer-assisted image analysis (CAIA) software that provides objective information to a clinician by analyzing eardrum images collected using currently available hardware. Based on previous work in applying similar methods to improve clinician performance in radiology and surgical pathology, our overarching hypothesis is that the incremental implementation of enhanced images, automated identification of abnormalities, and retrieval of similar cases will result in improved clinician diagnostic accuracy. In our preliminary work, we developed software, called Auto-Scope, which labels eardrums as “normal” versus “abnormal.” In this study, we propose two Specific Aims to improve diagnostic performance: Specific Aim #1: Create an enhanced composite image of the eardrum. Specific Aim #2: Use machine learning approaches for clinical decision support. The proposed research is relevant to public health because we are generating new methods aimed at improving diagnostic quality and reducing inter-observer variability, which will ultimately enable more accurate diagnosis and personalized therapeutic approaches for ear abnormalities. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission pertaining to the application of novel strategies that may improve human health, and NIDCD's mission of improving diagnosis and treatment of ear diseases, particularly otitis media.",Auto-Scope Software-Automated Otoscopy to Diagnose Ear Pathology,9790958,R21DC016972,"['Academy', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesteatoma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Cyst', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Ear Diseases', 'Financial Hardship', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hair', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nose', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Otitis Media', 'Otitis Media with Effusion', 'Otolaryngologist', 'Otoscopes', 'Otoscopy', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physician Assistants', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Side', 'Skin', 'Societies', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Tympanic membrane', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'acute infection', 'base', 'central database', 'clinical decision support', 'cognitive development', 'computerized', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'digital video recording', 'effusion', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'middle ear', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overtreatment', 'personalized therapeutic', 'primary care setting', 'prototype', 'software development']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,199142,0.0006740417173129897
"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry. This new technology will contribute to understanding complex processes in biological tissues that play a role in both health and disease.",Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry,9782980,UG3HL145593,"['Address', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Blood capillaries', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrospray Ionization', 'Ensure', 'Glass', 'Health', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Optics', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Slide', 'Solvents', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'automated analysis', 'biological systems', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human imaging', 'human tissue', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'innovation', 'interest', 'ionization technique', 'mass spectrometer', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'nano', 'nanoprobe', 'new technology', 'novel', 'operation', 'preservation', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'scale up', 'tool']",NHLBI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,UG3,2019,375000,0.01221838969006105
"Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB) Project Summary Each major human disease is associated with a specific range of morphological changes to cells and tissues in the micron scale. Normal and abnormal structure was discovered and is still characterized using histology - a microscopic technique that depends on physical tissue slices. Presently, histology’s use in systems biology is limited by its largely descriptive and two-dimensional nature. Making histology quantitative and three-dimensional would be potentially transformational for research and diagnostics, but has been impractical. Accordingly, we have now created a 3D form of histology by customizing X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) of fixed and stained, millimeter-scale, whole organisms and tissue samples. We used fixed and metal-stained, whole zebrafish because they contain a full range of tissues within the size range currently studied histologically. The result is the first practical way to create virtual histology-like “sections” in any plane. Three-dimensional, complete histological phenotyping has potential use in genetic and chemical screens, and in clinical and toxicological tissue diagnostics. Here, we propose the next steps needed to enable high-throughput, quantitative, 3D histological phenotyping of whole, millimeter-scale animals. The proposed work applies the principles of chemistry, physics, and computer science to improve image resolution, throughput, and analytics, organized into three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will build on our developments in this project and further improve imaging volume and resolution by upgrading imaging array, optics, and sub-pixel shifting, and to throughput by changes in sample embedding, loading geometry and mechanics, helical CT scanning, scintillator material, and to data sharing by improvements to the ViewTool infrastructure and user interface. Specific Aim 2 will yield reference images to define the range of normal phenotypic variation and to obtain samples related to a range of potential applications. Specific Aim 3 will apply the power of machine learning to segmentation, annotation, and analytics. Together, this work will establish a practical foundation for large-scale genetic and chemical screens involving mm-scale, whole organisms based on 3-dimensional, quantitative, histological phenotyping. The instrumentation and analytics will be state-of-the-art in its combination of resolution, field-of-view, pancellularity, image quality, analytical potential, throughput, sample stability, and reproducibility and largely usable with both tube and synchrotron X-ray sources. The voxel resolution will be at least 0.5 μm across fields-of-view of up to 1 cm. Representation of every cell type make the images suitable for cross-referencing across imaging modalities. Potential applications will be explored, “wild-type” will begin to be defined, and training sets for automated segmentation generated. The potential impact will encompass the missions of most NIH Institutes and Centers. The whole-animal genetic and chemical screens enabled are expected to impact drug development, diagnostics, and our basic understanding of how genes and environment define phenotype. Project Narrative Our group has established the only three-dimensional form of histology that is suitable for histopathology and quantitative tissue phenotyping, tissue X-ray microtomography (micro-CT). We outline here a plan to establish mechanisms for increasing resolution and field-of-view, to add sample multiplexing, to simply sample preparation, and to explore machine learning mechanisms for defining normal and abnormal structure towards whole-organism complete tissue phenotyping. The resulting tools will allow the community to comprehensively and computationally determine the roles of genes and environment in defining phenotype, which has implications in drug development, biomedical research, and medicine.",Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB),9792960,R24OD018559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Animal Genetics', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body measure procedure', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cesium', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Iodides', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Metals', 'Microscopic', 'Mission', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nerve', 'Normal Range', 'Online Systems', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Preparation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Spiral Computed Tomography', 'Stains', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Tube', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'clinical toxicology', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'crowdsourcing', 'data sharing', 'detector', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'feature detection', 'histological studies', 'human disease', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'microCT', 'millimeter', 'mutant', 'programs', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'virtual']",OD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R24,2019,667280,0.010499127842013359
"ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis Project Summary The morphology (or shape) of anatomical structures forms the common language among clinicians, where ab- normalities in anatomical shapes are often tied to deleterious function. While these observations are often quali- tative, ﬁnding subtle, quantitative shape effects requires the application of mathematics, statistics, and computing to parse the anatomy into a numerical representation that will facilitate testing of biologically relevant hypotheses. Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) and its associated suite of software tools, ShapeWorks, enable learning population-level shape representation via automatic dense placement of homologous landmarks on image seg- mentations of general anatomy with arbitrary topology. The utility of ShapeWorks has been demonstrated in a range of biomedical applications. Despite its obvious utility for the research enterprise and highly permissive open-source license, ShapeWorks does not have a viable commercialization path due to the inherent trade-off between development and maintenance costs, and a specialized scientiﬁc and clinical market. ShapeWorks has the potential to transform the way researchers approach studies of anatomical forms, but its widespread ap- plicability to medicine and biology is hindered by several barriers that most existing shape modeling packages face. The most important roadblocks are (1) the complexity and steep learning curve of existing shape modeling pipelines and their increased computational and computer memory requirements; (2) the considerable expertise, time, and effort required to segment anatomies of interest for statistical analyses; and (3) the lack of interoperable implementations that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research laboratories. In this project, we pro- pose ShapeWorksStudio, a software suite that leverages ShapeWorks for the automated population-/patient-level modeling of anatomical shapes, and Seg3D – a widely used open-source tool to visualize and process volumet- ric images – for ﬂexible manual/semiautomatic segmentation and interactive manual correction of segmented anatomy. In Aim 1, we will integrate ShapeWorks and Seg3D in a framework that supports big data cohorts to enable users to transparently proceed from image data to shape models in a straightforward manner. In Aim 2, we will endow Seg3D with a machine learning approach that provides automated segmentations within a statisti- cal framework that combines image data with population-speciﬁc shape priors provided by ShapeWorks. In Aim 3, we will support interoperability with existing open-source software packages and toolkits, and provide bindings to commonly used programming languages in the biomedical research community. To promote reproducibility, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc test cases. This project combines an interdisciplinary research and development team with decades of experience in statistical analysis and image understanding, and application scientists to conﬁrm that the proposed developments have a real impact on the biomedical and clinical research communities. Our long-term goal is to make ShapeWorks a standard tool for shape analyses in medicine, and the work proposed herein will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative ShapeWorks is a free, open-source software tool that uses a ﬂexible method for automated construction of sta- tistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes. ShapeWorks has been effective in a range of applications, including psychology, biological phenotyping, cardiology, and orthopedics. If funded, this application will ensure the viability of ShapeWorks in the face of the ever-increasing complexity of shape datasets and support its availability to biomedical researchers in the future, as well as provide opportunities for use in a wide spectrum of new biological and clinical applications, including anatomy reconstruction from sparse/low- dimensional imaging data, large-scale clinical trials, surgical planning, optimal designs of medical implants, and reconstructive surgery.","ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis",9882865,U24EB029011,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biological Testing', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Mail', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratory Research', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Programming Languages', 'Psychology', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'medical implant', 'open source', 'outreach', 'particle', 'patient population', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2019,340827,-0.00793915205605425
"q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy Project Summary/Abstract  Ischemic heart disease remains the top cause of death in the world. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) causes regional dysfunction which places remote areas of the heart at a mechanical disadvantage resulting in long term adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and complicating congestive heart failure (CHF). The course of MI and post-MI remodeling is complex and includes vascular and myocellular injury, acute and chronic inflammation, alterations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis. Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease and myocardial injury by imaging the LV at rest and after either exercise or pharmacologically-induced stress to reveal ischemia and/or scar. In our previous effort on this project, we developed quantitative 3D differential deformation measures for stress echocardiography from 4DE-derived LV strain maps taken at rest and after dobutamine stress. These measures can localize and quantify the extent and severity of LV myocardial injury and reveal ischemic regions. We now propose that improved versions of these same measures can be used for both targeting of therapy and outcomes assessment in the treatment of adverse local myocardial remodeling following MI. We choose a particular up and coming therapeutic strategy as an exemplar: the local delivery of injectable hydrogels within the MI region that are intended to alter the biomechanical properties of the LV myocardium, as well as inflammation, and thereby help to minimize adverse remodeling. Our new, robust approach for estimating improved dense displacement and differential deformation measures is based on an innovative data-driven, deep feed-forward, neural network architecture that employs domain adaptation between data from labeled, carefully-constructed synthetic models of physiology and echocardiographic image formation (i.e. with ground truth), and data from unlabeled noisy in vivo porcine or human echocardiography (missing or very limited ground truth). Training is based on tens of thousands of four-dimensional (4D) image-derived patches from these two domains, initially based on displacements derived separately from shape-based processing of conventional B-mode data and block-mode, speckle-tracked processing of raw radio-frequency (RF) data; and later based on learning directly from B-mode and RF image intensity information. After non-rigid registration of rest and stress 4DE image sequences, quantitative 4D differential deformation parameters will be derived from porcine and human echocardiographic test data. These parameters will be derived at baseline, and at several timepoints after delivery of injectable hydrogels into the MI region. The ability of the differential deformation parameters derived from 4D stress echocardiography to guide local delivery of injectable hydrogels in a MI region and assess/predict outcomes will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic porcine model of MI and post-MI remodeling. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility and the relationship to remodeling of our new robust, deep learning-based differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Project Narrative  At the core of the proposed effort is the development and evaluation of novel 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) echocardiographic imaging, image analysis, and machine learning methods that will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation due to stress. Our methods will use this information to guide delivery and assess outcome of a promising new therapy to improve the biomechanical properties of the heart after myocardial injury based on injectable hydrogels.","q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy",9746883,R01HL121226,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dobutamine', 'Echocardiography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Family suidae', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Four-dimensional', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydrogels', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injectable', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Ischemia', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitor', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Property', 'Recombinants', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cohort', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'feedforward neural network', 'heart imaging', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'radio frequency', 'spatiotemporal', 'synthetic construct', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,824785,-0.01619224827452677
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. It will pve the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process.",MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning,9624738,R01CA193730,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiation therapy', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'anatomic imaging', 'attenuation', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'density', 'electron density', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'primary endpoint', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'radiation delivery', 'reconstruction', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,343572,-0.004978091167116838
"I-Corps Program Application for Market Assessment of Non-invasive Imaging Device to Improve Outcomes of Amputations Surgery in Critical Limb Ischemia. 1. Executive Summary Nearly 150,000 patients in the US undergo lower extremity amputations annually secondary to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) complicated by critical limb ischemia (CLI).1,2,3 To increase a patient’s post-operative quality of life, surgeons attempt to salvage as much limb tissue as possible while also considering the likelihood of primary wound healing at a given level of amputation (LOA).4 The principal challenge in this decision is that surgeons overestimate the likelihood of healing at the selected LOA. Therefore, in the first year, 10% to 35% of amputations eventually require re-amputation to a more proximal level.5-7 This additional treatment prolongs the patient’s return to walking, worsening their condition and deteriorating their mental health. The burden to the healthcare system is immense. The average cost for each amputation is over $70,000, as evidenced by a recent publication that shows diabetic foot ulcer complications, mainly attributed to amputation, cost more than the five most costly forms of cancer.8 Despite these facts, there are no objective studies for selection of LOA in patients with PAD. To address this critical problem, Spectral MD (SMD) has developed a point-of-care imaging device (DeepView), which simultaneously performs multispectral imaging (MSI) and Photoplethysmography (PPG) imaging across the visible and infrared spectrum to obtain a quantitative microvascular tissue assessment. These optical measurements are integrated using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to provide a quantitative aid to the physician’s determination of tissue viability at a proposed amputation site. If used for routine assessment prior to amputation, SMD expects DeepView to reduce the rate of re- amputation by 70%, resulting in up to 38,000 fewer re-amputations per year while improving quality of life for amputees and reducing associated health costs. The central objective for SMD’s Phase I SBIR is to perform a feasibility clinical study to demonstrate the DeepView device will achieve greater than 90% accuracy in identifying the healing potential of tissue at the amputation site. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: Aim 1: Complete a Feasibility Study creating a database of pre-amputation images. This data will be used for construction of the AI algorithm to predict amputation site healing potential. Aim 2: Identify MSI and PPG features that can accurately predict amputation site healing potential. Aim 3: Using Aim I clinical data, finalize the AI algorithm architecture and estimate sample size needed for a Phase II Pivotal Study in which the necessary training data to achieve at least 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity will be obtained. As of this Supplement request, SMD has initiated a clinical study for feasibility and enrolled the first subject. Through collaboration with the clinical study site Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Dennis Gable, SMD developed the protocol and trained his research staff at the study site, Baylor Medical Center Plano, in the use of the DeepView device. SMD anticipates enrollment of five subjects each month over the next 6 months. The I-Corps team will consist of the following members: Michael DiMaio, MD – Role: C-Level Corporate Officer. Dr. DiMaio, MD is Founder and Chief Executive Officer of SMD and has led SMD in obtaining over $30M in non-dilutive government funding and private investments. His distinguished career includes extensive experience as an entrepreneur, clinician, and scientist. With over 20 years’ experience as a cardiovascular surgeon, Dr. DiMaio has a widespread network of physicians and hospitals from which to draw contacts for customer interviews. Jeffrey Thatcher, PhD – Role: PI. Dr. Thatcher is the Chief Scientist at SMD and is a leader in the development of diagnostic imaging for soft tissue diseases. He led SMD in conceptualizing and inventing SMD’s core imaging technology undergoing clinical trials in three wound diagnostics applications including: burns; diabetic ulcers; and amputation. Wensheng Fan, MS – Role: Industry Expert. Wensheng Fan is Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at SMD. He is an executive, entrepreneur, and innovator with over 20 years of experience in natural speech recognition and real time imaging systems. At SMD, he leads market engagement, strategic financial planning, and device development. Narrative In patients with peripheral arterial disease, reported rates of re-amputation due to non-healing of a primary amputation are very significant—approximately 20% of below-the-knee amputations require eventual revision, with even higher rates established for amputations at the level of the foot. There are no gold-standard tests for selection of level of amputation (LOA) to aid clinical judgment. To address this critical problem, SpectralMD is developing the DeepView-Gen2 imaging device that integrates multispectral imaging and a machine learning algorithm to quantitatively measure microvascular blood flow and tissue healing potential to assist in the clinical selection of LOA and minimize the incidence of re-amputation and its associated morbidity and mortality.",I-Corps Program Application for Market Assessment of Non-invasive Imaging Device to Improve Outcomes of Amputations Surgery in Critical Limb Ischemia.,9827388,R43HL142428,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Burn injury', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Diabetic ulcer', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Innovation Corps', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Ischemia', 'Judgment', 'Knee', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Principal Investigator', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'S Phase', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Soft Tissue Disorder', 'Specificity', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Viability', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Wound Healing', 'career', 'cost', 'experience', 'foot', 'healing', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'point of care', 'programs', 'real-time images', 'speech recognition', 'wound']",NHLBI,"SPECTRAL MD, INC.",R43,2019,54976,0.0022555336863639788
"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care. Our goal is to integrate, enhance, and disseminate three cutting edge ultrasound acquisition, analysis, and display toolkits to create a new framework called Slicer+PLUS that will serve as a catalyst for research and product development into low-cost point-of-care ultrasound applications. In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9750736,R01EB021396,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'catalyst', 'clinical translation', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data pipeline', 'elastography', 'emergency service responder', 'hospital patient care', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'off-label use', 'open source', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'point of care', 'portability', 'product development', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'scoliosis', 'signal processing', 'software development', 'transmission process']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2019,434944,0.023210693832778444
"Automatic SUV Extraction and Biodistribution Analysis of Preclinical PET Preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) plays a significant role in monitoring radiotracer biodistributions for the development of new therapies. The standardized uptake value (SUV) has become one of the most important quantitation measures in PET analysis. However, SUV extraction from PET data hinges on the ability to clearly delineate the organ region-of-interest (ROI) from an anatomical reference. Cross-comparison of different organ SUVs and biodistributions is also cumbersome due to complex registration strategies of each animal with an unknown pose and size. Operator bias and lack of efficient co-registration strategies results in poor data reproducibility, high data variability, low data throughput and prohibits the use of fully-automated data parsing and data analysis for predicting early therapy outcomes with high sensitivity. In Vivo Analytics will directly address these shortcomings by developing InVivoPET. It will be a cloud-based PET data analysis tool, which will enable automatic organ SUV extraction followed by an instantaneous biodistribution analysis. InVivoPET will automatically coregister PET images to the animal’s anatomy and will calculate biodistributions in almost real-time. InVivoPET consists of several parts. First, a Body Conforming Animal Mold (BCAM) enables consistent spatial and longitudinal registration of the animal’s pose and location to the PET data. Second, a statistical mouse atlas based on an Organ Probability Map (OPM) provides a digital and operator-independent organ ROI template. Third, a cloud-based software with a browser-based user interface enables an automatic organ SUV extraction with following biodistribution analysis. Last, machine learning and data mining algorithms can be applied in the future that will further enhance study outcomes. InVivoPET does not rely on manual delineation of organs. A machine-driven data analysis fully eliminates operator-dependent variability and increases data reproducibility. It will enable the drug development team to quantitate the impact of candidate therapeutics with the highest accuracy, reduces the time to enter clinical trials, reduces costs, and ensures the quantification and consistency of PET data. Therefore, the hypothesis is that the organ SUV can automatically be extracted from PET data using the BCAM and OPM. In Aim 1, we will modify the BCAM for housing mice with surface-protruding tumors and confirm the ability for spatially aligning mice with tumor xenografts to the OPM. In Aim 2, we will perform PET imaging of tumor bearing mice using 18F-FDG and confirm the ability for automatically extracting the organ SUV based on the OPM. The successful completion of the proposed project will help to commercialize InVivoPET, which will be sold as a plug-in to existing PET systems and as a PET- manufacturer independent Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Project Narrative: InVivo Analytics seeks funding for demonstrating the feasibility of automatically analyzing radiotracer biodistributions of small animal positron emission tomography (PET). Biodistribution analysis is currently operator-dependent, time-consuming, and prone to error while reducing the reproducibility of study results. The proposed technology will be fully automated, operator- independent, and will facilitate the development of new therapies in small animal models of infection, inflammation, and cancer.",Automatic SUV Extraction and Biodistribution Analysis of Preclinical PET,9680585,R43CA224841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Automation', 'Biodistribution', 'Biotechnology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Early treatment', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molds', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Outcome Study', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Posture', 'Probability', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radioisotopes', 'Reproducibility', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Shoulder', 'Skeleton', 'Standardization', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'animal imaging', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cloud based', 'commercial application', 'contrast enhanced', 'cost', 'data mining', 'digital', 'dosimetry', 'drug development', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'novel therapeutics', 'platform-independent', 'pre-clinical', 'radiotracer', 'sex', 'software as a service', 'subcutaneous', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapy development', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft', 'uptake']",NCI,"IN VIVO ANALYTICS, INC.",R43,2019,222931,-0.0054085632454922055
"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,9735326,R01EY028667,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cornea', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'mechanical properties', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,396887,-0.008446274658628725
"A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue Project Summary Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) uses secondary ion mass spectrometry and metal conjugated primary antibodies to simultaneously visualize dozens of proteins at subcellular resolution in a single tissue section. This technology is back compatible with archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) and has been used in peer-reviewed work to simultaneously visualize and quantify 36 proteins in retrospective human tissue cohorts. In line with the stated goals of the HuBMAP consortium to develop both “High-sensitivity, high-resolution imaging techniques that can rapidly provide spectral data over large areas of tissue” and “Quantitative imaging analysis tools, including automated 3D image segmentation, feature extraction, and image annotation,” the work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease. To achieve this, we will validate 100 FFPE antibodies and optimize ready-to-use multiplexed staining panels in lyophilized format that will permit storage for at least two years. Protocols and reagents for multiplexed signal amplification of protein and mRNA targets will be further refined, while next generation instrumentation will increase sample throughput to permit full tissue section imaging of up to 40 proteins in 1 hour. Standardized reagents and more robust instrumentation will be accompanied by an automated computational pipeline that utilizes a standard set of segmentation markers and machine learning to accurately identify nuclei and cell borders in any non-neural human tissue. This data will be used to cluster single cell events into functionally distinct populations according to morphology, protein expression, and histological distribution. The reagents and computational pipeline proposed here synergize with existing HuBMAP-funded platforms and could be readily generalized to virtually any high dimensional imaging modality. Thus, this work will not only provide a practical, back compatible imaging platform for high throughput multiplexed imaging, but will also accelerate development of other complimentary imaging technologies as well. Project Narrative Multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) is a new technology for visualizing dozens of proteins in standard clinical tissue biopsies at high resolution.

"New instrument and methods for fast, diagnostic-quality histology of un-embedded bone marrow and lymph node specimens Project Summary Over 600,000 bone marrow biopsies are performed every year in the United States, while hundreds of thousands more lymph node biospies are performed. Histological evaluation of these biopsies is a critical component of care for hematologic diseases including leukemia, lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disease and non-neoplastic conditions such as viral infections and autoimmune conditions.  We have developed a platform that we consider a paradigm shift in the histologic examination of tissues. It is based on a new chemical process, imaging, and image processing approach that we have dubbed Clearing Histology with MultiPhoton microscopy (CHiMP).The CHiMP technology enables visual analysis of entire intact, un-embedded and uncut specimens within a short time-frame and with a resolution that is amenable to primary diagnosis. The significant clinical benefits include: 1) potential for same-day diagnosis, 2) labor and cost savings, 3) access to 3D perspective, 4) increased visual data from same specimen, 5) complete tissue preservation for ancillary studies such as DNA analysis and 6) inherent benefits of digital data such as reduced risk of loss, ready remote review by experts, and amenability to machine learning tools. Hematopoietic tissue evaluation would similarly benefit from these advantages, but unfortunately the systems developed thus far lack the resolution typically needed for visual examination of hematopoietic tissues.  For this Phase I SBIR proposal, an objective is to develop customized optics to improve the resolution of our current microscopes and thereby enable use in the specialized field of hematology. Commercially available objective lenses that are compatible with our immersion medium are either limited to numerical apertures (NA) that are less than one, affecting resolution and image quality, or have insufficient working distances for imaging past the coverslip and surface roughness to obtain complete sections. We will design and test a custom objective lens with high NA and long working distance, suited for our proprietary reagents. Integrating such a lens into our microscope will also require the design of a custom scan lens, custom beam conditioning optics, and a custom polygon scanner.  An associated goal is to develop a novel approach to preparing bone marrow aspiration specimens that will make them amenable to imaging with CHiMP, potentially reducing the need for core biopsies by permitting unambiguous morphologic categorization of cell subtypes in their architectural context, without the routine need for immunohistochemistry, and while preserving nucleic acids for molecular/genetic evaluation. Project Narrative Applikate Technologies has developed a powerful platform for histological evaluation of tissue called Clearing Histology with MultiPhoton Microscopy, or CHiMP. This platform has many advantages over traditional approaches, including same-day turn-around, reduced labor costs, preservation of tissue for DNA analysis, and direct-to-digital imaging for ease of consultation with remote experts. This proposal seeks to develop custom optics to enable very-high-resolution imaging of bone marrow and lymph node samples that are critical for diagnosing diseases such as leukemia and lymphoma.","New instrument and methods for fast, diagnostic-quality histology of un-embedded bone marrow and lymph node specimens",9677952,R43CA235890,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Ancillary Study', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Aspiration', 'Bone marrow biopsy', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Core Biopsy', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Decalcification', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrosis', 'Goals', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematology', 'Hematopathology', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lymph', 'Machine Learning', 'Marrow', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Optics', 'Pan Genus', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Slide', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Preservation', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'disease diagnosis', 'hematopoietic tissue', 'high resolution imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'instrument', 'lens', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'lymph nodes', 'medical specialties', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'nanoparticle', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'pre-clinical', 'preservation', 'second harmonic', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,"APPLIKATE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R43,2019,224713,0.019813065509881215
"Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) is a consortium of centers developing quantitative image features, which are proving to be valuable biomarkers of the underlying cancer biology and that can be used for assessing response to treatment and predicting clinical outcome. It is now important to discover the best quantitative imaging features for detection of response to therapeutics, to identify subtypes of cancer, and to correlate with cancer genomics. However, progress is thwarted by the lack of shared software algorithms, architectures, and resources required to compute, compare, evaluate, and disseminate these quantitative imaging features within the QIN and the broader community. We propose to develop the Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline (QIFP), a cloud-based, open source platform that will give researchers free access to these capabilities and hasten the introduction of quantitative image biomarkers into single- and multi-center clinical trials. The QIFP will facilitate assessment of the incremental value of new vs. existing image feature sets. It will also allow researchers to add their own algorithms to compute novel quantitative image features in their own studies and to disseminate them to the greater research community. To accomplish this: (1) We will create an expandable library of quantitative imaging feature algorithms capable of comprehensive characterization of the imaging phenotype of cancer. It will support a broad set of imaging modalities and algorithms implemented in a variety of languages, including algorithms that provide volumetric and time-varying assessment of lesion size, shape, edge sharpness, and pixel statistics. (2) We will build a cloud-based software architecture for creating, executing, and comparing quantitative image feature-generating pipelines, including algorithms in the library and/or those supplied by QIN or other researchers as plug-ins. QIFP will also have (a) a machine learning engine that lets users specify a dependent variable (e.g., progression-free survival) that the quantitative image features can used to predict, and (b) an evaluation engine that compares the utility of particular features for predicting the dependent variable. (3) We will assess the QIFP in four ways: (a) by its ability to recapitulate the role of known biomarkers in a related clinical trial, (b) by comparing linear measurement, metabolic tumor burden and novel combinations of the features in our library for predicting one-year progression-free survival, (c) by merging imaging features with known host-, drug- and tumor-based follicular lymphoma biomarkers in order to develop the most robust and integrative predictive model for patient outcomes, and (d) by using the QIFP to combine and to evaluate image feature algorithms developed by another QIN team and our own NCI- funded team in the study of radiogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer. The QIFP will fill a substantial gap in the science currently being carried out in the QIN and in the community by providing the tools and infrastructure to assess the value of novel quantitative imaging features of cancer, and will thereby accelerate incorporating new imaging biomarkers into single and multi-center clinical trials and into oncology practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop and evaluate a software platform that has major relevance for human health. Many investigators are pursuing image-based surrogates for response to therapy that could be used in clinical trials to predict their success/failure earlier and that are more accurate than existing surrogates. Our developments will facilitate sharing, assessing, and comparing combinations of image feature-generating software algorithms for predicting treatment response, survival, and tissue genomics, which will, in turn, greatly accelerate the development and acceptance of new and more relevant imaging surrogates for assessing cancer treatments.","Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers",9753130,U01CA187947,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Privatization', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Pythons', 'RNA Sequences', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical predictors', 'cloud based', 'disorder subtype', 'feature detection', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vector', 'web based interface']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,567509,0.003032481285780749
"Deep LOGISMOS Abstract: This is a competitive continuation of a project that already yielded the highly flexible, accurate, and broadly applicable LOGISMOS framework for context-aware n-dimensional image segmentation. To substantially improve and extend its capability, we will develop Deep LOGISMOS that combines and reinforces the complementary advantages of LOGISMOS and deep learning (DL). There is growing need for quantitative failure-free 3D and higher-D image analysis for diagnostic and/or planning purposes. Examples of current use exist in radiation oncology, cardiology, ophthalmology and other areas of routine clinical medicine, many of which however still rely on manual slice-by-slice tracing. This manual nature of such analyses hinders their use in precision medicine. Deep LOGISMOS research proposed here will solve this problem and will offer routine efficient analysis of clinical images of analyzable quality. To stimulate a new phase of this research project, we hypothesize that: Advanced graph-based image segmentation algorithms, when combined with deep-learning-derived application/modality specific parameters and allowing highly efficient expert-analyst guidance working in concert with the segmentation algorithms, will significantly increase quantitative analysis performance in routinely acquired, complex, diagnostic-quality medical images across diverse application areas. The proposed research focuses on establishing an image segmentation and analysis framework combining the strengths of LOGISMOS and DL, developing a new way to efficiently generate training data necessary for learning from examples, forming a failure-free strategy for 3D, 4D, and generally n-D quantitative medical image analysis, and discovering ways for automated segmentation quality control. We will fulfill these specific aims:  1. Develop an efficient approach for building large segmentation training datasets in 3D, 4D, n-D  using assisted and suggestive annotations.  2. Develop Deep LOGISMOS, combining two well-established algorithmic strategies – deep learning  and LOGISMOS graph search.  3. Develop and validate methods employing deep learning for quality control of Deep LOGISMOS.  4. In healthcare-relevant applications, demonstrate that Deep LOGISMOS improves segmentation  performance in comparison with state-of-the-art segmentation techniques. Deep LOGISMOS will bring broadly available routine quantification of clinical images, positively impacting the role of reliable image-based information in tomorrow’s precision medicine. Narrative: Previous phases of this successful research project were devoted to the development of new graph-based methods for multi-surface and/or multi-object multi-dimensional biomedical image segmentation. Deep learning is emerging as an important new way to learn from large sets of examples. This proposal will combine deep learning and graph-based image analysis to maximize their combined strengths and overcome their individual weaknesses with the overarching goal to facilitate routine use of quantitative medical image analysis techniques in personalized medical care.",Deep LOGISMOS,9831425,R01EB004640,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Awareness', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fundus photography', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Ophthalmology', 'Organ', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Slice', 'Stroke', 'Suggestion', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Tissue', 'adjudication', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'diabetic', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'macular edema', 'n-dimensional', 'precision medicine', 'response', 'success', 'task analysis', 'treatment planning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2019,409911,0.04839216166419191
"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies.

"LATTICE: A Software Platform for Prospective and Retrospective Image Based Translational Research PROJECT SUMMARY Imaging forms the backbone of living subjects research. Living subjects research is both essential to the progress of translational medicine and very expensive. The research community actively seeks to develop and validate new clinical endpoints to solve a range of etiology, natural history, diagnostic and prognostic problems. This project aims to develop and commercialize LATTICE, an Electronic Research Record, Image Management and Sharing Solution, and Deep Learning Platform. LATTICE is designed to increase the efficiency of imaging-driven biomedical research and clinical trials. This efficiency is accomplished first through a structured workflow that includes protocol management, subject scheduling, and records collection from multiple imaging modalities. Access to imaging and associated data within the same workflow simplifies the process for the research team. Structuring the data into a de-identified, privacy-managed Image Bank enables sharing for collaboration and re-use for retrospective research. Image processing algorithms connected to the Image Bank facilitate batch analysis, while the system also provides a platform for the development of new image-based outcome measures and clinical endpoints. A key objective of LATTICE is to enable investigators and collaborators to accelerate the translation of insights to the clinic with maximum efficiency. Successful translation requires structuring the workflow, record keeping, and protocols into a rigorous, transparent, reproducible and validated process. LATTICE is designed to reduce the friction in translating successful research projects to the clinic. Researchers in the Advanced Ocular Imaging Program (AOIP) at the Medical College of Wisconsin developed elements of LATTICE as separate technologies. The Specific Aims of this proposal are directed to an integrated workflow addressing a broader set of objectives. The AOIP LATTICE Electronic Research Record will be translated into a commercially managed repository and brought under regulatory Design Control. The current AOIP Image Bank containing 3,000,000 de- identified retinal images will be integrated into the LATTICE workflow. Critically, this integration will allow the sharing of the Image Bank with external researchers. Three retinal image process algorithms that operate on retinal images will integrate into this workflow. These algorithms include analysis of adaptive optics images of the fundus, analysis of the foveal avascular zone from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and model-based analysis of the fovea imaged with OCT. A computational deep learning workflow will also be prototyped using a cloud-based architecture. This final workflow will be constructed to demonstrate the feasibility of deploying a collaborative deep learning environment for the development of new clinical endpoints using shared, de-identified images. LATTICE will be a unique system for both prospective and retrospective translational research. LATTICE will make a profound impact on the cost of managing image-based research and add leverage to translational research expenditures for moving insights into the clinic. PROJECT NARRATIVE LATTICE is an innovative electronic research record and development platform for image-based ophthalmic research. LATTICE is designed to reduce the cost of translational research, promote the re- use of images, and simplify the development and application of new techniques to analyze medical images. LATTICE will integrate research workflow tools with a database of 3,000,000 retinal images and advanced image processing software to accelerate the process of translating eye research insights from the lab to the clinic.",LATTICE: A Software Platform for Prospective and Retrospective Image Based Translational Research,9777970,R43EY030408,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Documentation', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Expenditure', 'Eye', 'Friction', 'Future', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Image', 'Libraries', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Natural History', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Subjects', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Secure', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Vertebral column', 'Wisconsin', 'Writing', 'adaptive optics', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'educational atmosphere', 'fovea centralis', 'fundus imaging', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging program', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'ocular imaging', 'operation', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'repository', 'retinal imaging', 'system architecture', 'tool', 'translational medicine', 'web services', 'wiki']",NEI,"TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING INNOVATIONS, INC.",R43,2019,299999,0.04345403452608714
"Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning Abstract In 2015, 1,658,370 new cancer cases are estimated to occur in the US, where nearly two-thirds will have radiation therapy (RT). Given that there are over 2,300 RT centers in the US, and current systems for contouring organs at risk (OARs) rely mostly on manual methods, there is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour OARs in medical images at a high degree of automation and for impacting current practice of RT planning. Encouraged by our strong Phase I results in thoracic and head and neck (H&N) body regions compared to current industry systems, we seek the accuracy, efficiency, and clinical acceptance of the contours output by our software product to significantly exceed those of existing systems. Our overall aim for Phase II is to advance the algorithms and prototype software developed in Phase I into a leading commercial software product, and demonstrate its efficacy in multiple medical centers across the country with diverse populations. Phase II specific aims are three-fold: (1) Further advance the automatic anatomy recognition algorithms from Phase I using advanced deep learning techniques. (2) Develop a cloud-based software auto contouring service. (3) Perform clinical evaluation of the new software on H&N and thoracic cases. Aim 1 will be accomplished in three stages: (a) Automating the process of defining the body region on given patient CT studies, which is currently done manually in our system, via a new concept of virtual landmarks using deep learning techniques. (b) Improving object recognition/ localization accuracy from the current 2 voxels for “good” quality data sets to 1 voxel and from 4-5 voxels for “poor” quality data sets to 2-3 voxels by using virtual landmarks to learn object relationships. (c) Improving object delineation by combining object localization methods with deep learning techniques applied to the vicinity of the localized objects to bring boundary distance accuracy within 1 voxel. Aim 2 will be achieved by developing a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service model to implement the software that incorporates the algorithms. To accomplish Aim 3, an evaluation study involving four academic RT centers will be undertaken to assess the efficiency, accuracy, and acceptability of the contours output by the new software. To assess efficiency, contouring time taken by the current clinical process will be compared to the time taken by the new software method plus any manual adjustment needed. Accuracy will be assessed by comparing software output to carefully prepared ground truth contours. Acceptability will be determined by conducting a blinded reader study, where an acceptability score (1-5) is given by radiation oncologists to software produced contours, ground truth contours, and contours produced by the normal clinical process, and comparing these scores. Expected clinical outcomes are significantly improved clinical efficiency/ acceptability of contouring compared to current practice. There is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour organs at risk in medical images at a high degree of automation for impacting current practice of radiation therapy planning. Encouraged by strong competitive results from the Phase I part of this project, in this grant, further technical advances and a cloud-based software service are proposed. A multicenter clinical evaluation of the new product is also planned to assess the clinical efficacy of the system.",Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning,9761481,R42CA199735,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Blinded', 'Body Regions', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Grant', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health Personnel', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thorax', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Object Attachment', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Service delivery model', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical efficacy', 'cloud based', 'deep learning', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'neural network', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'software as a service', 'software development', 'software systems', 'treatment center', 'treatment planning', 'virtual']",NCI,"QUANTITATIVE RADIOLOGY SOLUTIONS, LLC",R42,2019,873369,0.01929432591451168
"Accelerating Community-Driven Medical Innovation with VTK Abstract Thousands of medical researchers around the world use VTK —the Visualization Toolkit— an open-source, freely available software development toolkit providing advanced 3D interactive visualization, image processing and data analysis algorithms. They either use VTK directly in their in-house research applications or indirectly via one of the multitude of medical image analysis and bioinformatics applications that is built using VTK: Osirix, 3D Slicer, BioImageXD, MedINRIA, SCIRun, ParaView, and others. Furthermore, VTK also provides 3D visualizations for clinical applications such as BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system and Zimmer’s prosthesis design and evaluation platform. VTK has been downloaded many hundreds of thousands of times since its initial release in 1993. Considering its broad distribution and prevalent use, it can be argued that VTK has had a greater impact on medical research, and patient care, than any other open-source visualization package.  This proposal is in response to the multitude of requests we have been receiving from the VTK medical community. The aims are as follows:  1. Aim 1: Adaptive visualization framework: Produce an integrated framework that supports  visualization applications that balance server-side and client-side processing depending on data size,  analysis requirements, and the user platform (e.g., phone, tablet, or GPU-enabled desktop).  2. Aim 2: Integrated, interactive applications: Extend VTK to support a diversity of programming  paradigms ranging from C++ to JavaScript to Python and associated tools such as Jupyter Notebooks,  integrating with emerging technologies such as deep learning technologies.  3. Aim 3: Advanced rendering, including AR/VR: Target shader-based rendering systems and AR/VR  libraries that achieve high frame rates with minimal latency for ubiquitous applications that combine  low-cost, portable devices such as phones, ultrasound transducers, and other biometric sensors for  visually monitoring, guiding, and delivering advanced healthcare.  4. Aim 4: Infrastructure, Outreach, and Validation: Engage the VTK community and the proposed  External Advisory Board during the creation and assessment of the proposed work and corresponding  modern, digital documentation in the form of videos and interactive web-based content. Project Narrative The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open source, freely available software library for the interactive display and processing of medical images. It is being used in most major medical imaging research applications, e.g., 3D Slicer and Osirix, and in several commercial medical applications, e.g., BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system. VTK development began in 1993 and since then an extensive community of users and developers has grown around it. However, the rapid advancement of cloud computing, GPU hardware, deep learning algorithms, and VR/AR systems require corresponding advances in VTK so that the research and products that depend on VTK continue to deliver leading edge healthcare technologies. With the proposed updates, not only will existing applications continue to provide advanced healthcare, but new, innovative medical applications will also be inspired.",Accelerating Community-Driven Medical Innovation with VTK,9740493,R01EB014955,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Augmented Reality', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biometry', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cloud Service', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Publications', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Side', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cloud based', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'digital', 'health care delivery', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'new technology', 'open source', 'outreach', 'point of care', 'portability', 'processing speed', 'real world application', 'response', 'sensor', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend', 'virtual reality', 'web services']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2019,508446,0.013322253666051742
"ClearScope Combined in vivo and ex vivo three‐dimensional (3D) whole‐brain imaging of non‐transgenic and transgenic animal models holds the promise of novel insights into neural network connectivity patterns. With regard to ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole‐brain datasets, the best approach is brain clearing followed by whole‐brain light sheet microscopy (LSM) because of its unique combination of speed, 3D resolving power, and low phototoxicity compared to confocal and multiphoton microscopy. Unlike other methods, the combined brain clearing / LSM approach makes it possible to use intact tissue and retain all intracellular connections within the brain structure. However, LSM systems commercially available are not suitable for ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole‐brain datasets in advanced connectomics research. Recently, Dr. Raju Tomer (Dept. Biol. Sci., Columbia Univ., New York, NY) developed light sheet theta microscopy (LSTM), essentially a unique arrangement of two light sheets oblique to the specimen and one detection objective perpendicular to the specimen. This novel microscope is the basis for a number of capabilities in LSTM that are not all available with any other commercially available LSM systems. The LSTM technology has distinct advantages over confocal and other light sheet microscopes, including the unmatched ability to image thicker tissue specimens over a larger lateral area (XY) at higher optical resolutions, while maintaining fast imaging speed, high imaging quality, and low photo‐bleaching. This promising technology serves as the basis for this Lab to Marketplace proposal to develop the ClearScope™, which refines and improves Dr. Tomer's original LSTM system to create a successful commercial microscope for wide‐spread adoption. The key technical objectives for developing the ClearScope as a commercial product include creating and testing (i) a ClearScope prototype based on an optimized microscope hardware design; (ii) novel microscope hardware components for the ClearScope, comprising a novel chamber that contains the investigated specimen and the immersion medium, and a novel detection objective changer; (iii) novel control and image acquisition software for the ClearScope; and importantly, (iv) novel software that surpasses the existing state‐of‐the‐art technology to assemble acquired image stacks into large 3D image volumes exceeding 10TB without need to downsample the image information. The production version of the ClearScope will benefit the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general by improving understanding of neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large‐scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. In particular, this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases. The proposed project will enable important new research, that is not currently feasible, into whole-brain neural network connectivity patterns by means of ex vivo light microscopic imaging of three-dimensional whole-brain datasets. To achieve this, the proposed project will create the ClearScope light sheet microscope featuring signficant capabilities to image thick specimens of unlimited lateral (XY) size with resolution that permits investigatons of subcellular structures to distinguish adjacent neuronal processes (axons, dendrites, varicosities and dendritic spines). Because these features are not all available with any commercially available light sheet microscopes, the benefit for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be the possibility to better understand neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions, ultimately resulting in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases.",ClearScope,9677046,R44MH116827,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Lateral', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'New York', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Phototoxicity', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rattus', 'Refractive Indices', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Varicosity', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'ex vivo imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R44,2019,699967,-0.0026427563021485584
"Expanding field-of-view with reduced tissue displacement in micro-endoscopic computational imaging PROJECT SUMMARY Optical imaging methods are well-established in neuroscience, but high-speed, high- resolution volumetric imaging of neural activity in deep tissue remains a challenge. A number of techniques address limited aspects of this goal, and most are applicable primarily to acute preparations. We propose to develop and test a novel approach to achieve three-dimensional “deep-tissue” imaging for high spatial and temporal resolution neural recording by combining aspects of embedded optical probes with computational imaging techniques. Rather than use a single micro-endoscopic probe, we propose to utilize an array of narrower probes, or optrodes, to reduce the volume of tissue displacement. Computational imaging through each probe can be performed to achieve a field of view (FOV) at a desired distance from the probe tip. Combining the fields of view from multiple probes arranged in an array then provides a composite image field that is much larger than achievable from a single micro-endoscope. In our approach, each ∼0.1 mm diameter probe of the array acts as an independent micro- endoscope. In order to achieve full-field imaging across the array, the individual fields must intersect, and the computational method must be scaled to accommodate, and stitch, multiple fields. In pursuit of these goals, we propose three Aims: Optimizing the FOV of a single micro-endoscope - The purpose of this Aim is to characterize the FOV for an individual probe at multiple depths, and optimize the FOV to about 0.3mm through control over the shape of the probe tip and light collection numerical aperture. Accelerating calibration and reconstruction - In this Aim, we will pursue efficient computational approaches for calibration based upon ray-tracing simulations and image reconstruction based on deep learning. Scaling the FOV with an endoscope array - The computational image reconstruction method will be scaled to accommodate small micro-endoscope arrays (e.g. 4 element) arranged in a hexagonal lattice with FOV of 0.6mm at a 1.5mm depth. NARRATIVE Imaging deep inside tissue, including the brain, is critical to understanding various biological processes. Doing so through a small probe is also of primary importance for minimizing tissue damage. In this proposal, we apply computational techniques to create fluorescent images using an array of microscopic glass needles to guide light in and out of a mouse brain. The simplicity and small footprint of our system have the potential for deep-brain imaging (depths > 1.5 mm) across a large (mm) field of view, which should enable a wide variety of biological and neuroscience studies in the future.",Expanding field-of-view with reduced tissue displacement in micro-endoscopic computational imaging,9829467,R21EY030717,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Coupled', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Endoscopes', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Fluorescent Probes', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Holography', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Miniaturization', 'Mus', 'Needles', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Penetration', 'Preparation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'absorption', 'adaptive optics', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fluorescence imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'lens', 'microendoscope', 'multi-photon', 'neural circuit', 'novel strategies', 'optical fiber', 'optical imaging', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinal rods', 'simulation', 'temporal measurement']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2019,456800,0.01873514484835905
"Quantitative topographic endoscopy for improved screening of non-polypoid colorectal neoplasms Project Summary This project will create and assess new optical imaging and computational technologies with the goal of improving the detection rates of precancerous, non-polypoid lesions during colonoscopy screening. Identifying and removing these subtle lesions is critical to improving the protective value of colonoscopy in reducing mortality from colorectal cancer. However, current approaches to non-polypoid lesion detection are largely unsuccessful because they are time-consuming and require specialized training (chromoendoscopy), or they start with poor image contrast (software analysis of conventional video). This project focuses on developing a novel technique, called quantitative topographic endoscopy (QTE), that optically measures colon surface properties via a modified commercial colonoscope. The key innovation in this proposal is to utilize structured illumination and build on concepts from computer vision and optical engineering to acquire high-resolution 3D images of the colon surface through a custom endoscope. The project will be implemented through three specific aims: (1) develop a miniaturized, quantitative, high-resolution topography system, (2) implement QTE in a modified commercial colonoscope ready for clinical testing, and (3) determine the validity of QTE in a phantom model and its clinical feasibility in a pilot human study. QTE systems developed in this project will be tested in tissue-mimicking phantoms with a goal of achieving better than 1-mm height sensitivity, in ex-vivo resected colon samples with a goal of accurately reconstructing surface shapes from a complex tissue, and in a pilot human study with the goal of obtaining surface topography non-polypoid lesions. Beyond increasing non-polypoid lesion detection rates, QTE has the potential to address other limitations of colonoscopy, including preventing missed polypoid lesions, classifying lesions for resect-and-discard strategies, and improving colonoscopy quality metrics. Additionally, the development of a QTE system that is approved for human studies will serve as a platform for future clinical assessment of other optical techniques such as spatial frequency domain imaging and speckle imaging in a variety of gastroenterology applications. Project Narrative Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Screening colonoscopy can significantly reduce mortality from colorectal cancer but is limited by high miss rates for precancerous non- polypoid lesions. This project will develop new imaging and computational techniques for improving the detection rates of these lesions during colonoscopy screening.",Quantitative topographic endoscopy for improved screening of non-polypoid colorectal neoplasms,9769725,R21EB024700,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopes', 'Colonoscopy', 'Color', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dyes', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Engineering', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Knowledge', 'Large Intestine', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polypectomy', 'Polypoid Lesion', 'Polyps', 'Premalignant', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resected', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spatial\xa0Frequency\xa0Domain\xa0Imaging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surface Properties', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'adenoma', 'base', 'chromoscopy', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'computer aided detection', 'contrast imaging', 'human study', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'miniaturize', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'phantom model', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'vector']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,327488,-0.0181681689561991
"Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the introduction of many novel techniques to minimize radiation dose in CT, there is still a large variation in terms of radiation dose levels prescribed in CT exams and therefore a large variation of diagnostic performance. Some patients may receive higher dose than necessary. Some may be under-dosed and mis- diagnosed as a result of insufficient image quality. In order to determine the appropriate amount of radiation dose reduction in each exam, accurate quantification of diagnostic performance is needed so that the dose reduction can be achieved without sacrificing important diagnostic information. However, currently there is a lack of efficient and quantitative tools for objective assessment of diagnostic performance, particularly for many of the novel dose reduction methods involving non-linear processing of the data such as iterative reconstruction and deep-learning-based noise reduction methods. The specific goal of this application is to disseminate a highly automated solution, CT Protocol optimization (CTPro) software, to a wide CT community. This quantitative tool provides an efficient implementation of diagnostic performance assessment and CT radiation dose optimization. This tool is based on channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), which itself was developed decades ago to mimic human observer visual responses in signal detection tasks. However, the use of CHO in clinical CT is quite limited because of a lack of rigorous validation and efficient and robust implementation in practice. We were the first to demonstrate its correlation with human observer performance in low-contrast detection, classification and localization tasks in clinical CT. The main objective of the current proposal is to optimize this tool for simplicity and robustness, and disseminate it to CT researchers and clinical users, which will be accomplished through 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Optimize CTPro for simplicity, robustness, and generalizability. Aim 2: Develop an open-source web-based platform for software dissemination. Aim 3: Build use cases and disseminate CTPro. The proposed work is significant because the software tool will allow any CT users and researchers to perform CT radiation dose optimization and diagnostic performance evaluation in an efficient, quantitative, and objective manner. This work is innovative in that the automated tool will use quantitative measures of diagnostic performance to systematically guide the complex task of CT dose optimization, moving beyond traditional metrics that are inappropriate for many novel dose reduction techniques. The software tool, once widely employed, will facilitate a paradigm shift in how dose optimization and the evaluation of dose reduction techniques are performed, and will allow a more rapid and consistent adoption of dose reduction technology into clinical practice, which will benefit millions of CT patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a lack of quantitative tools for efficient and objective assessment of diagnostic performance in CT, which is the reason why inappropriate radiation dose is frequently used in CT exams, resulting in unnecessarily high radiation exposure to patients or lose of important diagnostic information. The purpose of this project is to disseminate a highly automated solution to a wide CT community for efficient CT radiation dose optimization. If successful, appropriate amount of radiation can be prescribed for millions of CT patients at any facility, while maintaining the level of diagnostic information required for high quality patient care.",Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment,9881453,U24EB028936,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Encapsulated', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newsletter', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'symposium', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'web site']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U24,2019,397500,-0.0033198362867172806
"Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The inability of non-invasive techniques to quantify disease progression has limited understanding of the pathogenesis of OA. While numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been proposed for imaging OA, sensitivity to bone metabolism has been limited. We propose to develop advanced three-dimensional PET-MRI methods for bone and soft tissue metabolism to study the response of the tissues in the joint to changes in knee load. This work will lead to a new understanding of OA pathogenesis by revealing relationships between changes in cartilage and bone metabolism over time. This project aims to develop PET-MRI methods to sensitively track changes of OA in response to biomechanical loading. Our specific aims are to (1) Develop accurate, reproducible and dose-optimized kinetic models of dynamic 18F-NaF PET-MRI for quantitative bilateral whole joint imaging using deep learning and advanced MR coil technology, (2) Study the relationship between resting state bone metabolism and biomechanics using PET- MRI and (3) Perform a longitudinal study to assess the response of our new imaging methods to changes in joint biomechanics from gait retraining. The innovation of this work lies in the development of novel imaging techniques that simultaneously offer quantitative measures of tissue physiology in cartilage and bone using PET-MRI. The significance of this work is that we will be able to sensitively and quantitatively track changes in bone metabolism and soft tissue microstructure due to changes in biomechanical loading in the knee joint over time. This will provide new and more sensitive imaging tools to assess the responses of the joint to biomechanical interventions to treat OA such as gait retraining, bracing, or high tibial osteotomy. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for assessment of disease-modifying treatments such as bracing or gait modification. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using positron-emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health during mechanical treatment of osteoarthritis. !",Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis,9817807,R01AR074492,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Arthralgia', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Matrix', 'Bone Spur', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone remodeling', 'Cartilage', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Fluoride Ion', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Needs Assessment', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteotomy', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sclerosis', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone', 'bone metabolism', 'cartilage metabolism', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'gait examination', 'gait retraining', 'imaging approach', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'joint loading', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'mineralization', 'molecular marker', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'soft tissue', 'subchondral bone', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,561592,0.008780798390452786
"Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT Project Summary: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. Diagnosis and stratification of disease phenotypes are important in order to decipher the effects of novel therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individuals. Few computerized diagnostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with visual and surgical lung biopsy; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good predictive models with localized region exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use as a derivative dataset the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF and 266 patients with IPF suspected, but not IPF based on HRCT and the surgical biopsy who have participated in multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for high through-put quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier with features of anatomic distribution and reproducible imaging features expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score, testing on separate data from in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitial Lung Disease Program. Furthermore, the second aim is to develop a rate of progression at local region and to aggregate predictive models using Cox proportional regression models, which will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that diagnose and anticipate disease course in patients with IPF and subdividing patients into more homogeneous groups prior to the development of significant respiratory impairment. We anticipate that models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions to define more homogeneous cohorts for purposes of testing new targeted therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression. Relevance to Public Health: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rate of progression is highly variables, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using new drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to diagnose and predict disease course robustly in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with IPF and non-IPF with reducing chance of lung biopsy and predict slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more time to treat patients and timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.",Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT,9765383,R21HL140465,"['Acute', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stable Disease', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'data archive', 'digital imaging', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'functional decline', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,113241,-0.017814436675419123
"STAN-CT: Standardization and Normalization of CT images for Lung Cancer Patients Project Summary/Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and one of the most common cancers among both men and women in the United States. Recent advances in high-resolution imaging set the stage for radiomics to become an active emerging field in cancer research. However, the promise of radiomics is limited by a lack of image standardization tools, because computed tomography (CT) images are often acquired using scanners from different vendors with customized acquisition parameters, posing a fundamental challenge to radiomic studies across sites. To overcome this challenge, especially for large-scale, multi-site radiomic studies, advanced algorithms are required to integrate, standardize, and normalize CT images from multiple sources. We propose to develop STAN-CT, a deep learning software package that can automatically standardize and normalize a large volume of diagnostic images to facilitate cross-site large-scale image feature extraction for lung cancer characterization and stratification. By precisely mitigating the differences in advanced radiomic features of CT images, STAN-CT will overcome research silos and promote medical image resource sharing, ultimately improving the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. Our goal will be achieved through two Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a working prototype to standardize CT images. First, we will collect raw image data from lung cancer patients and reconstruct CT images using multiple image reconstruction parameters, and we will scan a multipurpose chest phantom along with five different nodule inserts. Then, we will develop and train STAN-CT for CT image standardization. An alternative training architecture will be developed to achieve the improved model training stability. In Aim 2. We will deploy and test STAN-CT for image standardization locally and across three medical centers. First, we will make the STAN-CT software package available to the public by providing a menu-driven web-interface so that that users can conveniently convert medical images that were taken using non-standard protocols to one or multiple standards that they specify. Second, we will deploy STAN-CT at the University of Kentucky for local performance validation. We will test the functionality, reliability, and performance of STAN-CT using both patient chest CT image data collected at large-scale and the phantom image data, both independent to training. Third, we will deploy and test STAN-CT at the University of Kentucky as well as the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Emory University for cross- center performance validation. We will use the same multipurpose chest phantom and both standard and non- standard protocols to validate STAN-CT at the three centers. We will test the generalizability of STAN-CT using clinical CT images of human patients and will determine whether a model trained using the data from one medical center are applicable for images collected at another place. Finally, we will distribute the software package of STAN-CT for public use. STAN-CT will enable a wide range of radiomic researches to identify diagnostic image features that strongly associated with lung cancer prognosis. Project Narrative Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most popular diagnostic image modalities routinely used for assessing anatomical tissue characteristics for disease management. However, CT images are often acquired using scanners from different vendors with different imaging standards, posing a fundamental challenge to radiomic studies across sites.

"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management. Aim 3) Disseminate software and knowledge, via a) deploying our software to the clinic at Penn as well as to selected collaborating institutions, in order to test and further refine the software accordig to feedback; b) freely distributing our software to the research community; c) organizing various educational activities for both clinicians and informaticians, and setting up and maintaining support forums. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advanced computer analysis methodology for interpretation of radiologic images of cancer, emphasizing brain and breast cancer. The functionality of the software will substantially transcend limitations of current analysis of cancer images, and will open the way for more precise and effective surgical planning as well as for more specific diagnosis of cancer based on its imaging characteristics, eventually leading to individualized medicine.",Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer,9754585,U24CA189523,"['Algorithmic Software', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational Activities', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Industrialization', 'Infiltration', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Transcend', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'computational suite', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging probe', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular subtypes', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'web site']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U24,2019,578546,-0.059912351722170284
"Multiband ASL for Neurodevelopment Study Project Summary/Abstract The developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood is marked by a mix of potential and vulnerability. A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during this critical period, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and the first signs of emotional disorders. It is important to understand detailed patterns of typical development, so alterations can be identified and rectified as early as possible. As an entirely noninvasive and quantitative imaging method, arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is increasingly being recognized as an important biomarker for functional brain development in both healthy populations and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, there remain significant challenges for making ASL an impactful tool in studying neurodevelopment, including: 1) a coarse spatial resolution of ~4x4x4mm3, 2) susceptibility to head motion with segmented 3D acquisitions, and 3) potential confounding effects of age dependent variations in arterial transit time using a single post-labeling delay (PLD) scan. Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) or multiband (MB) is a new accelerated imaging technology that simultaneously excites multiple slices and recovers each slice with parallel imaging techniques. Preliminary studies combining MB with ASL showed that MB can reduce T1 relaxation of the label, improve spatial coverage and/or resolution compared to those of standard 2D ASL. MB imaging may also overcome the limitation of 3D ASL acquisitions in terms of head motion and spatial blurring. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of existing MB ASL is inferior to that of 3D ASL. This project builds on two recent innovations from our lab: 1) a constrained slice-dependent (CSD) background suppression (BS) technique that improves the SNR of 2D MB pCASL to be comparable to that of 3D pCASL; and 2) a single-shot 3D GRASE pCASL method with 2D CAIPIRINHA accelerations that improves the imaging speed of 3D pCASL. The goal of this R01 project is to develop and evaluate cutting-edge MB pCASL protocols that are able to offer a high spatial resolution of isotropic 2mm or higher, resistance to head motion and multi-delay capability for accurate perfusion quantification in pediatric populations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoising algorithm for multi-delay MB pCASL will be further developed. The developed suite of MB pCASL protocol and post- processing algorithms will be evaluated in 40 typically developing children and adolescents. The successful completion of this R01 project will lead to a robust multi-delay MB pCASL protocol that is highly valuable as potential biomarker for both neurodevelopment research and pediatric clinical care. To maximize the scientific and clinical impact, we will continue disseminating the pulse sequence and associated post-processing software as we have been doing in the past decade. Relevance to Public Health A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during the developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and emotional disorders.

"3-D Imaging Flow Cytometry PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to develop and test two innovative platforms and related software for 3-D imaging flow cytometry of fluorescent or absorbing (stained) samples. These systems will allow 3-D structural and functional imaging of many single cells at a subcellular resolution and at a scale that used to be available only in flow cytometry or recently in 2-D imaging. Thereby, the proposed methods have the potential to fundamentally change the ways cultured cells, patient-derived samples, and small experimental organisms are studied. Automated classification based on the 3-D features will enable the diagnosis of hematologic disorders at single-cell precision. Existing 3-D microscopy methods can provide the same information at higher resolution; however, by relying on a scanning mechanism they cannot be applied to suspending cells, especially in a flow configuration, which is essential for high-speed interrogation. Snapshot 3-D microscopy techniques have been developed to address this challenge, but they have insufficient spatial resolution for single-cell imaging and suffer from long data processing time. We overcome these limitations by combining two novel snapshot techniques developed by the PI with the most rigorous optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies. We will use an array of lenslets, which simultaneously records many projection images corresponding with different viewing angles. The use of pupil phase masks, designed using wavefront coding and a theory of 3-D high-numerical-aperture optical imaging, will increase the resolution of each projection image to the theoretical limit given by the objective-lens numerical aperture. The target resolution is 0.5 µm, which is comparable to existing 2-D imaging flow cytometry systems. The target imaging throughputs based on current component technologies are 120 volumes/sec for fluorescence imaging and 700 volumes/sec for absorption imaging, which are higher than 100 volumes/sec of cutting-edge 3-D optical microscopy for stationary specimens. The vast amount of data acquired by these 3-D imaging systems imposes a serious challenge to data processing. The developed systems record true projection images, which obviate iterative deconvolution process, thereby allowing much faster tomographic reconstruction than in existing snapshot techniques. Using general-purpose graphics processing units and optical diffraction tomography, which includes the diffraction of light by subcellular organelles, our tomographic reconstruction algorithm will be faster yet more accurate than existing approaches. Further, we will explore the feasibility of applying a deep convolutional neural network to the images acquired by the developed systems for accurate single-cell classification based on 3-D features. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop 3-D imaging flow cytometry platforms for fluorescent or absorbing (stained) cells at high resolution and high throughput in a flow configuration. The developed systems will be built upon two novel snapshot 3-D techniques developed by the PI in combination with most rigorous 3-D optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies.

"SUPPORT AND DEVELOPMENT OF EMAN FOR ELECTRON MICROSCOPY IMAGE PROCESSING EMAN is one of the most well-established and widely used scientific image processing suites targeting the rapidly growing CryoEM/CryoET community worldwide. In turn, the CryoEM and CryoET studies which it enables permit determination of the structures of interacting macromolecules both in-vitro and in-vivo, and are being used to better understand the biochemical processes taking place in cells, to better identify potential drug targets and develop novel diagnostics. With the higher resolutions now possible in this field, direct drug interaction structural studies are now possible, and being used to gain insight into the mode of action of drugs within the cell. Unlike many newer tools in the field, such as Relion, CisTEM and CryoSparc, which focus on specific refinement tasks, EMAN is a versatile, modular suite capable of performing a variety of image processing tasks with hundreds of algorithms supporting virtually all of the standard file formats and mathematical conventions used in the field, as well as other related imaging fields. It provides an ideal platform for prototyping fundamental new algorithm developments, while still able to achieve data-limited resolution in single particle reconstruction. While high resolution single particle refinement has become routine in recent years, thanks largely to the dramatic data quality improvements provided by new detector technology, there remain significant opportunities for improvements in mitigating model bias, efficient use of data, and analysis of complexes with compositional or conformational variability. Some of the most important problems from a biological perspective involve the sort of compositional and conformational variability which remain challenging problems. The field also remains susceptible to problems of initial model bias, which are exacerbated in systems exhibiting structural variability, and as a result many structures are still published with exaggerated resolution claims. The standard protocols used by many in the field typically involve discarding a very large fraction of the raw data (as much as 80-90% in some cases), often based on qualitative assessments, raising questions related to rigor and reproducibility of structural results. In this proposal, we will develop or adapt image processing techniques to help resolve these issues, based on developments or unrealized concepts from mathematics and computer science. CryoEM and CryoET are used to study the structures of interacting biomolecules in the cell at resolutions 100x better than the best possible light microscope. This methodology permits new insights into the biomolecules which underlie disease, can shed light on structural changes in diseased cells and provide direct information on how drugs interact with the molecules they target. This grant develops the software used to turn noisy 2-D electron microscope images into reliable 3-D structures of individual molecules extending to near-atomic resolution.",SUPPORT AND DEVELOPMENT OF EMAN FOR ELECTRON MICROSCOPY IMAGE PROCESSING,9886087,R01GM080139,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Electron Microscope', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Exhibits', 'Grant', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Light Microscope', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Scheme', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'case-based', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'detector', 'file format', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'macromolecule', 'mathematical sciences', 'microscopic imaging', 'neural network', 'novel diagnostics', 'particle', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'software development', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,344862,-0.007378599018052447
"Quantitative Low-Dose PET Imaging Project summary Quantitative PET has become increasingly important in clinical management and research, in particular for predicting and assessing response to therapy for cancer patients. Current PET protocols involve injection of PET tracers that typically result in ~6-7 mSv radiation dose to patients. For patients who require multiple repeated PET scans to monitor the response to therapy, and for patients who need PET scans with two or more tracers (e.g., FDG + FLT) to optimally predict response to therapy, it is critical to reduce the radiation dose from the PET tracer injection, while still maintaining the quantitative accuracy and image quality for cancer management. When reducing injection dose, the PET images will have higher noise due to fewer detected counts, which will subsequently introduce errors in quantitative measurements. For moving organs and tumors such as those in the lung and abdomen, respiratory motion can substantially degrade quantitative accuracy, so motion correction is required. Conventional motion correction uses a gating strategy that rebins the PET data, resulting in substantially higher noise in each gate. More advanced methods incorporate motion vector estimation in the image domain for post-registration or motion compensated image reconstruction using all detected events without increasing noise. The motion vectors need to be derived from gated PET, which are even noisier when using a reduced tracer injection in low-dose studies, imposing substantial challenges for accurate and reliable voxel-by-voxel motion vector estimation. In dynamic PET studies with clinical cardiac tracers and other novel oncology and neurology tracers, quantification is even more challenging for low-dose PET as each dynamic frame only contains a small fraction of detected events so the high image noise will affect the determination of image-derived input functions and can lead to bias and high noise in parametric images. In this project, to reduce image noise and maintain quantitative accuracy in PET, we propose to develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple innovative imaging methods for low-dose PET data to achieve comparable quantitative accuracy as full-dose PET. While the imaging developments are generally applicable to all PET tracers in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, since cancer is the primary clinical application of PET, we will focus our investigation and optimization in this project on three lung cancer imaging tracers at different clinical adoption stages as examples: 1) 18F-FDG as a routine clinical tracer, 2) 18F-FMISO for hypoxia studies as a tracer for human research, and 3) 18F-PD-L1 that specifically binds to human PD-L1 in tumors and other organs as a recent first-in-human tracer.

"Medical Image Perception Society XVIII Conference MIPS XVIII brings together an international community of experts including radiologists, pathologists, other image-based clinicians, psychologists, statisticians, physicists, engineers, and computer scientists investigating the extraction of diagnostic information from medical images. The meeting forges research and learning opportunities for new students and young researchers in a dedicated forum unmatched by other meetings. MIPS XVIII is being organized by the Medical Image Perception Society (a US-based society; Elizabeth Krupinski, PhD President) in conjunction with local hosts Trafton Drew, PhD (University of Utah Psychology) and William Auffermann, MD, PhD (University of Utah Radiology); and committee Lauren Williams (University of Utah) trainee member, David Alonso trainee member (University of Utah). It will run July 14-17, 2019 at the University of Utah Guest House & Conference Center located near the University of Utah campus. Nine topic areas have been selected for MIPS XVIII, reflecting important dimensions of medical image interpretation. This year’s special focus theme is addressing other image-based specialties outside radiology. Studying how clinicians extract diagnostic information from images identifies the causes of missed diagnoses and ways to eliminate these errors. Careful design and evaluation of imaging systems are critical in view of their enormous costs. With the current emphasis in the practice of medicine on “meaningful use” and “accountable care” to improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of care, the role the clinician as decision-maker cannot be ignored. Medical image perception research develops and applies modern methods to the evaluation of observer performance in diagnostic imaging tasks. Understanding basic aspects of the perception of medical images can reduce diagnostic error and improve medical decision-making quality. This grant will support 10 students to attend and present their research at MIPS XVIII. To date, 115 students have been awarded scholarships. The primary goal in supporting these students is to create opportunities and offer supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee’s career to enhance their research potential and likelihood of success. The meeting brings together researchers investigating the process of extracting diagnostic information from medical images to render accurate and efficient diagnostic decisions. Opportunities for advanced, interdisciplinary training of young scientists interested in medical image perception research and its relevance to disease prevention and treatment are often quite limited at the university level. Since 1997, 115 students have been awarded MIPS scholarships, having a significant impact on the field by creating opportunities and offering supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee’s career to enhance their research potential and likelihood of success as independent basic science and clinician-scientist researchers.",Medical Image Perception Society XVIII Conference,9833051,R13EB028683,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'American', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malpractice', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'Modernization', 'Ophthalmology', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physician&apos', 's Role', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Scholarship', 'Scientist', 'Societies', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Work', 'automobile accident', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'health care quality', 'image processing', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'member', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'radiologist', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'whole slide imaging']",NIBIB,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R13,2019,10000,0.02563043865653715
"Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the advent of whole slide digital scanners, histopathology slides can be digitized into very high-resolution digital images, realizing a new ""big data"" stream that can potentially rival ""omics data"" in size and complexity. Just as with the analysis of high-throughput genetic and expression data, the application of sophisticated image analytic tools and data pipelines can render the often passive data of digital pathology (DP) archives into a powerful source for: (a) rich quantitative insights into cancer biology and (b) companion diagnostic decision support tools for precision medicine. Digital pathology enabled companion diagnostic tests could yield predictions of cancer risk and aggressiveness in a manner similar to molecular diagnostic tests. However, prior to widespread clinical adoption of DP, extensive evaluation of clinical interpretation of DP imaging (DPI) and accompanying decision support tools needs to be undertaken. Wider acceptance of DPI by the cancer community (clinical and research) is hampered by lack of a publicly available, open access image informatics platform for easily viewing, managing, and quantitatively analyzing DPIs. While some commercial platforms exist for viewing and analyzing DPI data, none of these platforms are freely available. Open source image viewing/management platforms that cater to the radiology (e.g. XNAT) and computational biology communities are typically not conducive to handling very large file sizes as encountered with DPI datasets.  This multi-PI U24 proposal seeks to expand on an existing, freely available pathology image viewer (Sedeen Image Viewer) to create a pathology informatics platform (PIIP) for managing, annotating, sharing, and quantitatively analyzing DPI data. Sedeen was designed as a universal platform for DPI (by addressing several proprietary scanner formats and ""big data"" challenges), to provide (1) reliable and useful image annotation tools, and (2) for image registration and analysis of DPI data. Additionally, Sedeen has become an application for cropping large DPIs so that they can be input into programs such as Matlab or ImageJ. Sedeen has been freely available to the public for three years, with over 160 unique users from over 20 countries.  Building on the initial successes of Sedeen and its existing user base, our intent is to massively increase dissemination of DPI and algorithms in the cancer research community and clinical trial efforts, as well as to contribute towards the adoption of a rational and standardized set of DP operational conventions. This unique project will allow end users with different needs and technical backgrounds to seamlessly (a) archive and manage, (b) share, and (c) visualize their DPI data, acquired from different sites, formats, and platforms. The PIIP will provide a unified user interface for third party algorithms (nuclear segmentation, color normalization, biomarker quantification, radiology-pathology fusion) and will allow for algorithmic evaluation upon data arising from a plurality of source sites. By partnering with professional societies, we envision that the PIIP user base will expand to include the oncology, pathology, radiology, and pharmaceutical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will result in the further development of advanced functionality of the already existing digital pathology image informatics platform (PIIP) with an established user-base for cancer research. Such an enhanced platform will provide the much-needed foundation for advancing (a) routine clinical adoption of digital pathology for primary diagnosis and (b) training and validation of companion diagnostic decision support systems based off histopathology. Thus, the project is aligned with the NCI's goal to foster innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving human health.","Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management",9784742,U24CA199374,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Community Trial', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Felis catus', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Language', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Students', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'annotation  system', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research site', 'companion diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data pipeline', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput analysis', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'open source', 'pathology imaging', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'repository', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user friendly software', 'validation studies']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U24,2019,533529,0.021255942993133114
"A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney Project Summary  Despite the widespread prevalence of ultrasound imaging in hospitals today, the clinical utility of ultrasound guidance is severely hampered by clutter and reverberation artifacts that obscure structures of interest and com- plicate anatomical measurements. Clutter is particularly problematic in overweight and obese individuals, who account for 78.6 million adults and 12.8 million children in North America. Similarly, interventional procedures of- ten require insertion of one or more metal tools, which generate reverberation artifacts that obfuscate instrument location, orientation, and geometry, while obscuring nearby tissues, thus additionally hampering ultrasound im- age quality. Although artifacts are problematic, ultrasound continues to persist primarily because of its greatest strengths (i.e., mobility, cost, non-ionizing radiation, real-time visualization, and multiplanar views) in comparison to existing image-guidance options, but it would be signiﬁcantly more useful without problematic artifacts.  Our long-term project goal is to use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to provide interventional radiologists with artifact-free ultrasound-based images. We will initially develop a new framework alternative to the ultrasound beamforming process that removes needle tip reverberations and acoustic clutter caused by multipath scattering in near-ﬁeld tissues when guiding needles to the kidney to enable removal of painful kidney stones. Our ﬁrst aim will test convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that input raw channel data and output human readable images with no artifacts caused by multipath scattering and reverberations. A secondary goal of the CNNs is to learn the minimum number of parameters required to create these new CNN-based images. Our second aim will validate the trained algorithms with ultrasound data from experimental phantom and ex vivo tissue. Our third aim will extend our evaluation to ultrasound images of in vivo porcine kidneys. This work is the ﬁrst to propose bypassing the entire beamforming process and replacing it with machine learning and computer vision techniques to remove traditionally problematic noise artifacts and create a fundamentally new type of artifact-free, high-contrast, high-resolution, ultrasound-based image for guiding interventional procedures.  This work combines the expertise of an imaging scientist, a computer scientist, and an interventional ra- diologist to explore an untapped, understudied area that is only recently made feasible through improvements in computing power, advances in computer vision capabilities, and new knowledge about dominant sources of image degradation. Translation to in vivo cases is enabled by our clinical collaboration with the Department of Radiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to develop these tools and capabilities to eliminate noise artifacts in interventional ultrasound, opening the door to a new paradigm in ultrasound image formation, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients with clearer, easier-to-interpret ultrasound images. Subsequent R01 funding will customize our innovation to addi- tional application-speciﬁc ultrasound procedures (e.g., breast biopsies, cancer detection, autonomous surgery). Project Narrative Artifacts in ultrasound images, speciﬁcally artifacts caused by multipath scattering and acoustic reverberations (which occur when imaging through the abdominal tissue of overweight and obese patients or visualizing metallic surgical tools), remain as a major clinical challenge. There are no existing solutions to eliminate these artifacts based on today's signal processing techniques. The goal of this project is to step away from conventional signal processing models and instead learn from raw data examples with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that differentiate artifacts from true signals, and thereby deliver clearer, easier-to-interpret images.",A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney,9600285,R21EB025621,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Breast biopsy', 'Bypass', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Fatty Liver', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interventional Ultrasonography', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver diseases', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Needles', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'North America', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Readability', 'Resolution', 'Retroperitoneal Space', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surgical Instruments', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fetal', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'imaging scientist', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'signal processing', 'tool']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,194115,0.0011218153430150068
"Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors Project Summary/Abstract One of the key advances in modern positron emission tomography (PET) systems for clinical imaging is the use of time-of-flight (TOF) information. In cancer imaging TOF provides superior lesion detection and more accurate quantification that is crucial in measuring response to therapy, as well as in neurological and cardiovascular imaging applications. An additional benefit of TOF is the ability to lower the radiation dose or scan time without sacrificing image quality, important for patient safety and comfort. The magnitude of these clinical benefits is determined by the TOF resolution of the PET detectors, therefore the prospect of achieving unprecedented image quality and clinical imaging capabilities with superior TOF resolution has fueled significant research in developing detector technology for TOF-PET systems. However, these developments have been largely unaccompanied by advances in signal processing methods needed to extract TOF information from the detector’s electrical signals, with most detectors making use of crude analog algorithms that discard most of the useful timing information contained in the signals. Now, with the availability of low-cost fast waveform digitizers, there is an exciting opportunity to implement sophisticated digital signal processing algorithms to achieve superior TOF resolution. The main advantage of developing advanced signal processing algorithms is that it presents a cost-effective route to improved TOF resolution that is complementary to instrumentation innovations. In essence, the TOF gain comes for free; the detector signals already contain the information needed for better TOF resolution, it just needs to be used effectively. Here we propose to tailor deep learning techniques to estimate TOF from the detector signals. Deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a powerful approach to learn complex representations of input data that can be used for tasks such as classification and regression. CNNs are therefore very suitable for directly estimating TOF from the detector waveforms, since these waveforms are influenced by several complex and intertwined processes which are hard to accurately model. Furthermore, large amounts of ground truth training data are readily generated. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of CNN-based TOF estimation, and found up to 23% improvement in TOF resolution compared to standard signal processing methods. This proposal aims to optimize these methods to push the limits of achievable TOF resolution and develop methods for their practical implementation. First, we will develop CNN architectures and methods suitable for silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) that are now used in modern TOF-PET systems. We will also optimize the digitizing parameters to make optimal use of CNNs for TOF estimation. Second, we will implement CNN-TOF methods in a modern commercial PET detector, including using a global CNN to simultaneously estimate TOF and the crystal-of-interaction from the detector waveforms, demonstrating the practical feasibility of using this promising deep learning method in next generation PET systems. Narrative The use of time-of-flight information in positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful way to increase clinical imaging capabilities of PET, and is now used in most modern systems. Improving time-of-flight performance promises to provide substantial benefits for lesion detection in cancer imaging, kinetic modeling with dynamic imaging, and the use of lower radiation dose for patient safety. Here we introduce deep learning signal processing methods to significantly improve the performance of time-of-flight PET detectors without requiring new materials, which thereby represents a cost effective route towards maximizing the use of the rich imaging signal provided by time-of-flight.",Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors,9651713,R03EB027268,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Dose', 'Electronics', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human Engineering', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'analog', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'clinical imaging', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'photomultiplier', 'physical process', 'response', 'scale up', 'signal processing', 'time use', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2018,78500,0.032223121658071556
"Protected Radiomics Analysis Commons for Deep Learning in Biomedical Discovery Abstract  Development of emerging imaging systems for biological and medical imaging often involves multi-dimensional acquisition protocols and thus correspondingly the need for complex reconstruction algorithms and advanced machine learning algorithms in order to produce the desired resulting image and quantitative tumor characteristics. This proposal requests funding for a high performance computing system, entitled Protected Radiomics Analysis Commons for Deep Learning in Biomedical Discovery, to further the development and application of deep learning techniques to quantitative image analysis and image reconstruction. There are 12 specific NIH projects that will benefit from the proposed computing infrastructure system. We present the 12 projects through examples from within four Specific Research Topics areas: (a) tomographic image reconstruction, (b) quantitative image analysis, (c) functional quantification, and (d) association of radiomics (image data) with phenotypic and genomic data. The proposed system is a computing cluster, which uses ScaleMP's Versatile SMP software to aggregate the cluster nodes into a single symmetric multiprocessing computer. The major hardware components consist of 1 HP Enterpris\e ProLiant DL380 server and 8 Apollo 6500 compute nodes, with a total of 2.1 TB of main memory, 18 Intel Xeon E5-2640v4 10-core CPUs, and 32 nVidia Tesla P100 GPUs. The servers will be connected via a 100Gbps EDR Infiniband network. In addition, three important software components, which aim to reduce the complexity of the computing environment and increase researcher productivity, will be integrated into the hardware components: the aforementioned ScaleMP vSMP to create a single virtual computer from the cluster nodes, Cendio ThinLinc to provide remote desktop graphical login services, and Bitfusion Flex AI Platform which provides GPU virtualization, scheduling, and optimization, as well as curated container deployment of common deep learning frameworks.

The Protected Radiomics Analysis Commons for Deep Learning in Biomedical Discovery will allow researchers to expedite, extend, and translate their current NIH funding in areas of many- dimensional image reconstruction and image analysis algorithms – all of which will benefit greatly from deep learning approaches – within a secure, protected, and HIPAA-compliant sharable environment.",Protected Radiomics Analysis Commons for Deep Learning in Biomedical Discovery,9494294,S10OD025081,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Schedule', 'Secure', 'Services', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'biological systems', 'cluster computing', 'computer cluster', 'deep learning', 'genomic data', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'phenotypic data', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'reconstruction', 'tomography', 'tumor', 'virtual']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,S10,2018,338913,0.045361330252932756
"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress. We will then to apply this in a prospective, adaptive validation trial against oxygen-15 water PET CBF, using simultaneous PET/MRI to minimize biological variability. Finally, we will apply this improv- ed tool to study the effects of gender on CVR and its reproducibility. Successful completion of this study will result in a validated methodology to assess CVR in cerebrovascular disease patients without the use of radiation or contrast. As such, it will provide solid, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians developing new paradigms and interventions in patients with impaired CVR. There is strong evidence that imaging of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), the ability to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to a challenge, can identify patients at increased risk of stroke. Therefore, measuring CVR would be extremely useful for designing clinical trials of interventions to mitigate this risk. However, current methods to measure CBF and CVR are suboptimal, and do not work well in patients with cerebrovascular disease. The goals of this project are • to improve non-contrast, radiation-free arterial spin label MRI methods  using deep learning, a powerful form of artificial intelligence that has  shown tremendous progress for computer vision • to validate these methods against a CBF gold-standard, oxygen-15 water  PET, using simultaneous PET/MRI, using an adaptive “play-the-winner” strategy • to apply them to assess gender differences in CVR and test their  reproducibility, with the goal of establishing age and gender normative  ranges to better identify outliers.",Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning,9599417,R01EB025220,"['Acetazolamide', 'Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Bypass', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Cytolysis', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Excision', 'Gadolinium', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'ImProv', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Japanese Population', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Premenopause', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Spin Labels', 'Stress Tests', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Waste Products', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Xenon', 'base', 'blood flow measurement', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'cerebrovascular', 'cerebrovascular imaging', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'design', 'direct application', 'disability', 'evidence based guidelines', 'gender difference', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'men', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'response', 'stressor', 'stroke risk', 'systematic review', 'time use', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,653337,-0.07329015892014451
"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,9521289,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Step training', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'patient population', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,471965,0.04527851426141638
"MRI near Total Joint replacements Project Abstract Overview: The parent project for this supplement aims to provide routine MRI of subjects with total joint replacements by reducing the severe image artifacts near metal, while offering highly efficient patient-specific scans that can detect bone loss, infection, and temperature changes near the implant in clinically feasible scan times. The supplement aims to incorporate deep learning techniques to better meet the parent grant goals. Relevance: Total joint replacements are one of the most successful orthopedic procedures, used annually to reduce pain from joint diseases in about one million patients in the United States (a number projected to double by 2030). However, about 10% of joint replacements fail in 5-10 years due to bone loss (osteolysis), infection, or other complications, often leading to revision surgery. Accurate, early, non-invasive assessment of complications remains limited, but would offer earlier and less invasive treatments, reduce unnecessary surgery, or allow better surgical planning. Approach: Prior to, and during the parent grant period, we have developed novel “multi-spectral imaging” (MSI) MRI techniques that allow visualization of pathology adjacent to metallic implants, and together with other groups have successfully applied them to imaging of patients with devices including joint replacements and spinal fixation hardware. However these methods remain slow, have limited spatial resolution, and are challenging to use routinely. The recent growth of the machine learning field including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and its application to medical imaging offers unique opportunities to substantially improve MRI near metal, and specifically the goals of the parent grant. We propose 3 small, independent aims in the supplement: (1) to bring fast, isotropic imaging near metal to clinical practice by using CNN-based methods to reduce reconstruction times to under 30 seconds, (2) to improve image quality away from metal by using a new reconstruction and CNN to avoid needing standard imaging in addition to MSI methods and (3) to reduce background-gradient induced artifacts near to metal using a CNN-based approach to enable better diagnosis of abnormalities adjacent to metal. Summary: We aim to supplement our parent grant with CNN-based approaches to speed up scanning and image reconstruction, and to improve image quality near to and way from metal. These techniques will allow routine, non-invasive evaluation for earlier and more accurate detection and treatment of complications in these patients, as well as numerous other applications of MRI near metal implants. Project Narrative There is a growing need for accurate diagnosis of complications surrounding joint arthroplasty, where MRI would provide excellent contrast if not for the fact that the presence of metal severely degrades images. Building on recent ideas in MRI and deep learning, we propose to develop practical methods for routine clinical imaging of patients with metal implants by increasing speed as well as offering image contrast that shows infection and other complications near the metal devices. Ultimately these methods will be tested and offered for widespread use to enable earlier and better treatment of complications resulting from arthroplasty, as well as for better understanding of the implications of different devices.",MRI near Total Joint replacements,9750463,R01EB017739,"['Address', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Infection', 'Joint repair', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Procedures', 'Osteolysis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Stretching', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'arthropathies', 'bone loss', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'cluster computing', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'field study', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'pain reduction', 'parent grant', 'parent project', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'spectrograph']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,156870,0.014972048877336731
"Synergistic integration of deep learning and regularized image reconstruction for positron emission tomography Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography (PET) is a high-sensitivity molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, with the ability to observe molecular-level activities inside a living body through the injection of specific radioactive tracers. In addition to the commonly used F-18-FDG, new tracers are being constantly developed and investigated to pinpoint specific pathways in various diseases. New PET scanners are also being proposed by exploiting time of flight (TOF) information, enabling depth of interaction capability, and extending the solid angle coverage. To realize the full potential of the new PET tracers and scanners, there is an increasing need for the development of advanced image reconstruction methods. This grant application proposes a new framework for regularized image reconstruction that synergistically integrates deep learning and regularized image reconstruction. The new framework is enabled by the recent advances in machine learning, which provide a tool to digest vast amount information embedded in existing medical images. The proposed method embeds a pre-trained deep neural network in an iterative image reconstruction framework and uses the deep neural network to regularize PET image directly. By training the deep neural network with a large amount of high-quality low-noise PET images, the proposed method can capture complex prior information from existing inter-subject and intra-subject data and thus is expected to substantially outperform the current state-of-the-art regularized image reconstruction method. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop the theoretical framework to synergistically integrate deep learning in regularized image reconstruction for PET and (2) to implement the proposed method and validate its effectiveness using existing animal data. Once the proposed method is validated using existing animal data, we will seek funding to acquire necessary human data for the implementation of the proposed method on clinical PET scanners. Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique widely used in clinic for detecting cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders. This project will develop an innovative image reconstruction method that has potential to improve PET image quality and reduce radiation dose. Its success will improve the accuracy of PET for cancer detection and other diseases.",Synergistic integration of deep learning and regularized image reconstruction for positron emission tomography,9586688,R21EB026668,"['Advanced Development', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injections', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Neurology', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation', 'Radioactive Tracers', 'Rattus', 'Role', 'Solid', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anatomic imaging', 'animal data', 'base', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2018,221250,0.046628883626179764
"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder.

"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation. This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET in PET/MR and target delineation in radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from MR-only data.

"Enhanced x-ray angiography analysis and interpretation using deep learning Enhanced x-ray angiography analysis and interpretation using deep learning Over 1 Million diagnostic X-ray angiograms are performed annually in the US to guide treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) and cost over $12 billion. Despite being the clinical standard of care, visual interpretation is prone to inter- and intra-observer variability. Recently as part of the NHLBI supported Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) trial, our research team showed that cardiologists misinterpreted over 19% of angiograms obstructive CAD (greater than 50% vessel stenosis). Given the centrality of angiographic interpretation to the development of a treatment plan, reduced accuracy can lead to unnecessary poor outcomes and increased costs to our healthcare system. Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) offers a computed measure of disease severity. However, the time and training required to perform QCA has largely relegated its use to research applications. Recent advances in deep learning for medical image analysis offer an opportunity to address this problem. The potential impact is significant given increasing interpretation accuracy by 1% can positively benefit over 10,000 patients each year. Thus, our team proposes to develop an X-ray angiographic analysis system (XAngio) driven by deep learning technology to enhance physician interpretation. We are uniquely positioned to accelerate development of XAngio by leveraging our team’s PROMISE dataset of over 1,000 angiograms with expert QCA scoring. In Phase I, we will teach XAngio how to read angiographic images and how to discriminate obstructive CAD. XAngio will employ a convolutional neural network, a computer vision technique rooted in deep learning, to self-characterize angiographic features from labeled images. In order to infer additional information from vast amounts of unlabeled images, XAngio will incorporate a deconvolutional neural network technique to increase predictive performance. A pilot study of XAngio will test its ability to identify the presence of obstructive CAD in PROMISE angiogram images. If we are successful, we envision a Phase II proposal which is focused on clinical translation of the technology and assessment of its impact on improving visual interpretation in a cohort of cardiologists. Our goal is to combine recent advances in deep learning, big data from PROMISE, and scalable parallel computing to create XAngio.

"Improving Melanoma Pathology Accuracy through Computer Vision Techniques - the IMPACT Study ABSTRACT  This proposal will help to improve the accuracy of diagnosing melanoma and melanocytic lesions. The incidence of melanoma is rising faster than any other cancer, and ~1 in 50 U.S. adults will be diagnosed with melanoma this year alone. Our research team has noted substantial diagnostic errors in interpreting skin biopsies of melanocytic lesions; pathologists disagree in up to 60% of cases of invasive melanoma, which can lead to substantial patient harm. Our proposal uses computer technology to analyze whole-slide digital images of glass slides in order to improve the diagnosis of melanocytic lesions. Using data from an ongoing NIH study, we will digitize and study a set of 240 skin biopsy cases that includes a full spectrum of benign to invasive melanoma diagnoses. Each biopsy case has a reference consensus diagnosis developed by a panel of three international experts in dermatopathology and new data will be available from 160 practicing U.S. community pathologists, providing a uniquely rich clinical database that is the largest of its kind. This project will include novel computational techniques, including the detection of both cellular-level and architectural entities, and the use of a combination of feature-based and deep neural network classifiers. Our specific aims are: 1. To detect cellular-level entities in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions. 2. To detect structural (architectural) entities in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions. 3. To develop an automated diagnosis system that can classify digitized slide images into one of five possible diagnostic classes: benign; atypical lesions; melanoma in situ; invasive melanoma stage T1a; and invasive melanoma stage ≥T1b. In our proposed study, we are innovatively using computer image analysis algorithms and machine learning. This technology has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of pathologists by providing an analytical, undeviating review to assist humans in this difficult task. Project Narrative Diagnosis of melanoma and melanocytic skin biopsy lesions is among the most challenging areas of pathology and our preliminary data shows concerning levels of errors among pathologists. Our ultimate goal is to use innovative computer image analysis and machine learning techniques to reduce diagnostic errors and save patients' lives. The first step towards this goal is a correct diagnosis of melanoma.",Improving Melanoma Pathology Accuracy through Computer Vision Techniques - the IMPACT Study,9523267,R01CA200690,"['Adult', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Caring', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Dermatopathology', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mitotic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Precancerous melanosis', 'Process', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Skin', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'deep neural network', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maltreatment', 'melanocyte', 'melanoma', 'novel', 'skin lesion', 'stem', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,385011,-0.0012755469640195576
"Extracting rich information from biological images Project Summary  Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopes to image samples. Whether in small­ or large­scale microscopy experiments, biologists increasingly need software to identify and measure cells and other biological entities in images, to improve speed, objectivity, and/or statistical power.  The principal investigator envisions bringing transformative image analysis and machine learning algorithms and software to a wide swath of biomedical researchers. In a decade, researchers will tackle fundamentally new problems with quantitative image analysis, using seamless imaging workflows that have dramatic new capabilities going beyond the constraints of human vision.  To this end, the PI will collaborate with biologists on important quantitative imaging projects that also yield major advancements to their open­source image analysis software, CellProfiler. This versatile, user­friendly software is indispensable for biomedical research. Launched 125,000+ times/year worldwide, it is cited in 3,400+ papers from 1,000+ laboratories, impacting a huge variety of biomedical fields via assays from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning. CellProfiler evolves in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment that has yielded dozens of discoveries and several potential drugs.  Still, many biologists are missing out on the quantitative bioimaging revolution due to lack of effective algorithms and usable software for their needs. In addition to maintaining and supporting CellProfiler, the team will implement biologist­requested features, algorithms, and interoperability to cope with the changing land­ scape of microscopy experiments. Challenges include increases in scale (sometimes millions of images), size (20+ GB images), and dimensionality (time­lapse, three­dimensional, multi­spectral). Researchers also need to accommodate a variety of modalities (super­resolution, single­molecule, and others) and integrate image analysis into complex workflows with other software for microscope control, cloud computing, and data mining.  The PI will also pioneer novel algorithms and approaches changing the way images are used in biology, including: (1) a fundamental redesign of the image processing workflow for biologists, leveraging revolutionary advancements in deep learning, (2) image analysis for more physiologically relevant systems, such as model organisms, human tissue samples, and patient­derived cultures, and (3) data visualization and interpretation software for high­dimensional single­cell morphological profiling. In profiling, subtle patterns of morphological changes in cells are detected to identify causes and treatments for various diseases. We will also (4) integrate multiple profiling data types: morphology with gene expression, epigenetics, and proteomics. Ultimately, we aim to make perturbations in cell morphology as computable as other large­scale functional genomics data.  Overall, the laboratory’s research will yield high­impact discoveries from microscopy images, and its software will enable hundreds of other NIH­funded laboratories to do the same, across all biological disciplines. Public Health Relevance/Narrative Modern microscopy experiments are increasing in scale and scope; the research will result in pioneering computational techniques and software that will change the way microscopy images are used in biology. Biologists will use the resulting software to tackle fundamentally new problems using quantitative image analysis, including detecting changes in the appearance of cells that are overlooked by human vision and studying intact organisms and human tissue rather than isolated cells.

"A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a massive amount of clinical three-dimensional (3D) cardiac image data available today in numerous hospitals, but such data has been considerably underutilized in both clinical and engineering analyses of cardiac function. These 3D data offers unique and valuable information, allowing researchers to develop innovative, personalized approaches to treat diseases. Furthermore, using these 3D datasets as input to computational models can facilitate a population-based analysis that can be used to quantify uncertainty in treatment procedures, and can be utilized for virtual clinical trials for innovative device development. However, there are several critical technical bottlenecks preventing simulation-based clinical evaluation a reality: 1) difficulty in automatic 3D reconstruction of thin complex structures such as heart valve leaflets from clinical images, 2) computational models are constructed without mesh correspondence, which makes it challenging to run batch simulations and conduct large patient population data analyses due to inconsistencies in model setups, and 3) computing time is long, which inhibits prompt feedback for clinical use.  A potential paradigm-changing solution to the challenges is to incorporate machine learning algorithms to expedite the geometry reconstruction and computational analysis procedures. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to develop a novel computing framework, using advanced tissue modeling and machine learning techniques, to automatically process pre-operative clinical image data and predict post-operative clinical outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) intervention will serve as a testbed for the modeling methods. In Aim 1, we will develop novel shape dictionary learning (SDL) based methods for automatic reconstruction of TAVR patient aortic valves. Through the modeling process, mesh correspondence will be established across the patient geometric models. The distribution and variation of TAVR patient geometries will be described by statistical shape models (SSMs). In Aim 2, population-based FE analysis of the TAVR procedure will be conducted on thousands of virtual patient models generated by the SSMs (Aim 1). A deep neural network (DNN) will be developed and trained to learn the relationship between the TAVR FE inputs and outputs. Successful completion of this study will result in a ML-FE surrogate for TAVR analysis, combining the automated TAVR patient geometry reconstruction algorithms and the trained DNN, to provide fast TAVR biomechanics analysis without extensive re-computing of the model. Furthermore, the algorithms developed in this study can be generalized for other applications and devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current clinical image modalities can be utilized to develop patient-specific computational models to pre-operatively plan transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. However, the computational modeling and simulation processes are time-consuming, which limits clinical translatability. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to develop algorithms using machine learning techniques to rapidly process and predict TAVR computational simulation outcomes directly from clinical image data.",A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes,9518217,R01HL142036,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Extravasation', 'Feedback', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Valves', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Postoperative Period', 'Problem Sets', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Response Elements', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stents', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'calcification', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'population based', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing', 'simulation', 'speech recognition', 'time resolved data', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual clinical trial']",NHLBI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,392932,0.014605433351118231
"Image analytics prediction of corneal keratoplasty failure Image analytics for prediction of keratoplasty failure Summary We will create specialized image analytics software for prediction of keratoplasty (penetrating, endothelial) fail- ure from specular-reflection corneal endothelial cell (EC) images. Keratoplasties are the most common tissue transplant, with roughly a 10% failure rate, leading to blindness, patient discomfort/anxiety, and repeat kerato- plasties with a higher chance for failure than the initial procedure. With successful predictive image analytics, we will be in a position to identify transplanted corneas at risk and possibly treat them more aggressively with topical corticosteroids or other measures to prevent failure. Since a functional endothelial cell (EC) layer is necessary for the active ionic-pump-driven redistribution of fluid necessary to maintain the clear cornea, EC images have been analyzed as an indicator of cornea health. The normal EC layer exhibits high cell density arranged in a predominantly regular, hexagonal array. We will build on the use of existing quantitative bi- omarkers from EC images (EC density, coefficient of variation of cell areas, and hexagonality) used to evaluate cornea health. We will compute additional image features associated with local and long-range cell disarray, image attributes relevant to keratoplasty rejection, and traditional features from computer vision. Including this combination of features will provide rich inputs to machine-learning classifiers aimed at predicting future out- comes (e.g., failure or no failure). We will apply methods to a large aggregation of well-curated data from pre- vious NIH-funded studies at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and from previous studies at the Neth- erlands Institute for Innovative Ocular Surgery (NIIOS). Our team consists of image processing experts, oph- thalmologists, and staff from the CWRU Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences and University Hospitals (UH) Eye Institute’s Cornea Image Analysis Reading Center (CIARC), which is well-known for rigor- ous, highly repeatable assessment of conventional quantitative biomarkers in a large number of multi- institutional clinical trials. Together, our goal will be to determine if this “second generation” analysis of EC im- ages can lead to prediction of keratoplasty failure. If successful, this project will lead to software which can be translated to support research and clinical practice. Narrative Our goal is to create image analytic software that will predict the risk of keratoplasty failure from readily ob- tained corneal endothelial cell images. With knowledge of eyes at risk, physicians will be able to tailor treat- ments to improve cornea transplant success, thereby very positively impacting patients’ health.",Image analytics prediction of corneal keratoplasty failure,9592472,R21EY029498,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Cell Density', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Companions', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Endothelium', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descemet&apos', 's membrane', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Intraocular lens implant device', 'Intuition', 'Keratoplasty', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Netherlands', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Noncompliance', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetrating Keratoplasty', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Pump', 'Reading', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Seminal', 'Software Framework', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Topical Corticosteroids', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Transplanted tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical practice', 'data management', 'density', 'experimental study', 'hazard', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'quantitative imaging', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'success', 'validation studies', 'vision science']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,240000,0.0249888293450621
"Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement ABSTRACT This proposal aims to develop deep learning methods to automate the extraction of morphological imaging features relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA), and total knee replacement. While, quantitative evaluation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in OA research in the clinical setting MR reports often tend to be subjective, qualitative, and the grading schemes utilized in epidemiological research are not used because they are extraordinarily time consuming and do not lend themselves to the demands of todays changing healthcare scenario. The “Big Data” challenge and opportunity facing us makes it necessary to build enabling tools (i) to automate the extraction of morphological OA imaging features, with the aim of evaluating disease progression prediction capabilities on larger sample sizes that have never been explored before; (ii) to discover latent patterns by uncovering unexplored data-driven imaging features by the application of state of the art deep learning approaches (1); (iii) combine multi-modality imaging with clinical, functional, activity, and other data to define the trajectory of joint degeneration in OA. Leveraging the power of these state of the art techniques, and with the extraordinary availability of a large datasets of annotated images; in this project, we propose to develop an automatic post-processing pipeline able to segment musculoskeletal tissues and identify morphological OA features in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), as defined by commonly used MRI grading systems. Automation of morphological grading of the tissues in the joint would be a significant breakthrough in both OA research and clinical practice. It would enable the analysis of large sample sizes, assist the radiologist/clinician in the grading of images, take a relatively short amount of time, reduce cost, and could potentially, improve classification models. The availability of automatic pipelines for the identification of morphological abnormities in MRI would drastically change clinical practice, and include semi-quantitative grades, rather than subjective impressions in radiology clinical reports. In this study, we also aim to develop a complete supervised deep learning approach to obtain data-driven representations as non-linear and semantic aggregation among elementary features able to exploit the latent information hidden in the complexity of a 3D MR images, eliminating the need for nominal grades of selected features. This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning is revolutionizing medical imaging by solving challenging problems in disease classification, progression and therapeutic response. In this project, we focus on using deep learning methodology on magnetic resonance images of the knee to study osteoarthritis prevalence, and progression. The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.!",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,9724174,R61AR073552,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cartilage', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Subchondral Cyst', 'Supervision', 'Synovitis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disease classification', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'joint destruction', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'learning strategy', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R61,2018,24598,0.03795525611768727

This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning is revolutionizing medical imaging by solving challenging problems in disease classification, progression and therapeutic response. In this project, we focus on using deep learning methodology on magnetic resonance images of the knee to study osteoarthritis prevalence, and progression. The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.!",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,9526090,R61AR073552,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cartilage', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Subchondral Cyst', 'Supervision', 'Synovitis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disease classification', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'joint destruction', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'learning strategy', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R61,2018,399482,0.03795525611768727
"30th Annual MR Angiography Meeting Project Summary The objective of the 30th Annual Workshop on Magnetic Resonance Angiography is to provide a forum for scientists and scientist-clinicians, clinical staff and industry interested in MR angiography techniques. The Workshop is the annual meeting of the Society for Magnetic Resonance Angiography (SMRA). At this meeting, emerging techniques and exciting new applications to visualize the vascular system, measure and display blood flow and improve patient outcomes will be presented. MR angiography is an important clinical tool that is applied to millions of patients annually and accounts for an estimated 10% of all MR procedures. Recent advances in time-resolved imaging, non-contrast imaging, post-processing techniques, flow measurements, and flow visualization, as well other innovations, continue to make MRA a dynamic, cutting-edge area of interest for scientific investigation. A major goal of this SMRA Workshop is to provide scientists, clinicians, and students with the opportunity to build connections, pool their knowledge, and educate each other in order to accelerate the refinement of MRA technology and critically how to apply it in clinical practice. Topics for the MRA Workshop will include: vascular disease mechanisms, vessel wall and plaque imaging, quantification of blood flow dynamics, machine learning including deep learning plus `Big Data', vessel lumen imaging, MRA of the brain, heart, abdomen, and extremities; contrast agents, cardiac MR, assessment of cardiac structure & function, clinical study design, new MRA techniques, interventional MRI, MRI of implanted devices, technology assessment, and comparing MRI with other medical imaging modalities. The 3-day workshop will be preceded by an informative one-day educational program that will include both fundamental and advanced lectures from international experts in the field. These topics and educational objectives of the 30th Annual Workshop on Magnetic Resonance Angiography are directly related to the NHLBI mission to provide global leadership for research, training, and education to promote the prevention and treatment of heart and blood diseases. The scientific presentations will include new discoveries about the causes of disease and as such contribute to the translation of basic discoveries into clinical practice. In addition, the proposed educational activities as well as discussion among participants will foster training and mentoring of emerging scientists and physicians. In this context, the workshop will support a collaborative research infrastructure, including participants from academic institutions and industry.

"Deep radiomic decision support system for colorectal cancer Project Summary/Abstract Computer-aided detection (CADe) has been shown to increase readers’ sensitivity and reduce inter-observer variance in detecting abnormalities in medical images. However, they prompt relatively large numbers of false positives (FPs) that readers find tedious to review and, during this process, the readers can incorrectly dismiss true lesions prompted correctly to them by CADe systems. Thus, there is a demand for an advanced decision support system that would provide not only high detection sensitivity, but also high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a lesion. In this project, we propose to improve the detection specificity of CADe by deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) that can analyze the extrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the context of local anatomy, of target lesions, whereas current CADe systems consider only the intrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the shape and texture of detected lesions. Further, we can use DCNNs to provide an explanation of why a specific location was prompted by using anatomically meaningful object categories with similar-image retrieval of past diagnosed cases. In this project, we will focus on computed tomographic colonography (CTC), which is a minimally invasive screening method for early detection of colorectal lesions to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC), which is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Historically, however, only adenomas were believed to be precursors of CRC. Recent studies have revealed a molecular pathway where also serrated lesions can develop into CRC. Recent studies have indicated that CTC can detect serrated lesions accurately based upon the phenomenon called contrast coating. Thus, the goal of this project is to develop a deep radiomic decision support (DeepDES) system that leverages deep learning for providing high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of colorectal lesions, in particular, serrated lesions, and for providing diagnostic information that explains why a specific location was prompted as a lesion to assist readers in assessing detected lesions correctly. To achieve the goal, we will explore the following specific aims: (1) Develop a radiomic deep-learning (RAID) scheme for the detection of colorectal lesions, (2) develop a DeepDES system for diagnosis of detected lesions, and (3) evaluate the clinical benefit of DeepDES system. Successful development of the proposed DeepDES system will provide an advanced decision support that addresses the current concerns about CADe by yielding both high detection sensitivity and high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a target lesion. Broad adoption and use of the DeepDES system will advance the prevention and early diagnosis of cancer, and thus will ultimately reduce mortality from colorectal cancer in the United States.

"Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC) Project Summary/Abstract The ability to access huge cohorts of patient medical records and radiology data, the emergence of ever-more detailed imaging modalities, and the availability of unprecedented computer processing power marks the pos- sibility for a new era in neuroimaging, disease understanding, and patient treatment. To unlock the full medical potential made possible by these new technologies, new algorithms and clinically-relevant techniques must be developed by close collaboration between computer scientists, physicians, and medical researchers. We are excited to propose a national resource center with the goal of finding new ways of extracting disease characteristics from advanced imaging and computation, and to make these methods available to the larger medical community through a proven methodology of world-class research, open-source software, and exten- sive collaboration. The overarching theme for this P41 renewal is the discovery and analysis of novel imaging phenotypes to characterize disease. We use the term imaging phenotypes to describe patterns or features of disease that can be detected through imaging (predominantly MRI) followed by machine learning, statistical analysis, feature detection, and correlation with other indicators of disease such as structured patient infor- mation. The three proposed Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects address this common question us- ing a variety of complementary approaches and clinical testbeds. TR&D 1 addresses microstructure of tissue, including novel imaging methods to detect tumor microstructure. TR&D 2 investigates rich spatial patterns of disease extracted from clinical imaging with a focus on cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke. Finally, TR&D 3 proposes novel image and connectivity-based features that can be correlated with a variety of diseases, with a clinical emphasis on pediatric brain development. Technical innovation will be driven by intense collaboration between the TR&Ds and key collaborators in neurosurgery, neurology, and pe- diatrics. The TR&Ds will leverage recent important developments in the fields of image acquisition, machine learning, and data science to identify and exploit novel imaging phenotypes of disease. Building on our long history of developing clinically-relevant methods, each TR&D includes a translational and clinical validation aim to ensure our work is clinically relevant and effective at meeting the driving clinical goals.

"Quantitative MRI Radiomics of Breast Cancer in Assessment of Malignancy and Response to Therapy Project Summary We propose to introduce and optimize a new method of radiomics extraction via transfer learning with deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and to compare it to the conventional segmentation-based radiomics approach on breast dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images (DCE-MRIs). The field of breast radiomics has been expanding fast, with many clinical conclusions being successfully derived from medical images using qualitative analysis. In the past couple of years, deep learning has experienced explosive growth in image recognition, easily solving complex problems. Deep CNNs achieve remarkable classification results on everyday image datasets. We propose to investigate the utility of deep neural networks with regards to the medical image datasets, specifically on the breast DCE-MRI dataset. Given the relatively small sizes of these datasets, CNNs previously trained on non-medical images will be utilized for clinical classifications as feature extractors. We will investigate multiple parameters involved in the CNN feature extraction methodology and their effect on classification performance. Two clinical tasks will be studied under the proposed research: 1) malignancy assessment and 2) response to therapy prediction. The optimized CNN method will be compared to and combined with the conventional segmentation- based radiomics method. Furthermore, we aim to investigate the robustness of the segmentation-based features across MR scanners of different manufacturers. The first aim of the proposed research will study the robustness of the segmentation- based features extracted from images acquired on MR scanners of two different manufacturers. The robustness will be investigated under four clinical tasks, such as lymph node involvement and receptor statuses. The second aim will be focused on optimization of CNN feature extraction and subsequent classifier design. Lastly, under the third aim we will compare and combine the CNN and segmentation-based radiomics in the classification tasks of malignancy assessment and response to therapy prediction. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed research is to improve breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis based on dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images by introducing novel deep learning methods to medical image classification and combining it with the conventional radiomics systems. The incredible power of deep learning methods to classify everyday images shows great promise to make predictions based on medical image datasets.

"Neuroinformatics platform using machine learning and content-based image retrieval for neuroscience image data This project aims to develop NeuroManager™, an innovative neuroinformatics platform for advanced parsing, storing, aggregating, analyzing and sharing of complex neuroscience image data. A core technology that we will develop in NeuroManager will be Image Content Analysis for Retrieval Using Semantics (ICARUS), a novel, intelligent neuroimage curation system that will enable image retrieval based on visual appearance or by semantic concept. ICARUS will use machine learning applied to content-based image retrieval (CBIR) to build and refine models that summarize microscopic and macroscopic image appearance and automatically assign semantic concepts to neuroimages. Neuroscience research generates extensive, multifaceted data that is considerably under-utilized because access to original raw data is typically maintained by the source lab. On the other hand, there are many advantages in sharing complex image data in neuroscience research, including the opportunity for separate analysis of raw data by other scientists from another perspective and improved reproducibility of scientific studies and their results. Unfortunately, none of the neuroscience data sharing options that exist today fulfill all the needs of neuroscientists. To solve this problem, NeuroManager will include the following distinct, significant innovations: (i) versatility for handling two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional neuroimaging data sets from animal models and humans; (ii) functionality to share complex datasets that extends secure, privacy-controlled paradigms from institutional, laboratory-based and even public domains; (iii) flexibility to implement NeuroManager within an institute’s IT infrastructure, or on most cloud-based virtualized environments including Azure, Google Cloud Services and Amazon Web Services; (iv) and most importantly, the ICARUS technology for CBIR in neuroimaging data sets. The benefit of NeuroManager for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be to foster collaboration between scientists and institutions, promoting innovation through combined expertise in an interdisciplinary atmosphere. This will open new horizons for better understanding the neuropathology associated with several human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions at various levels (i.e., macroscopically, microscopically, subcellularly and functionally), ultimately leading to an improved basis for developing novel treatment and prevention strategies for complex brain diseases. In Phase I we will prove feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype software that will perform CBIR on 2D whole slide images of coronal sections of entire mouse brains from ongoing research projects of our collaborators. Work in Phase II will focus on developing the commercial software product that will include all of the innovations mentioned above. A competing technology with comparable functionality, addressing the full breadth of needs for modern neuroscience research, is currently not available commercially or otherwise. Narrative There are many advantages in sharing complex image data in neuroscience research, including the opportunity for separate analysis of raw data by other scientists from another perspective and improved reproducibility of scientific studies and their results; however none of the neuroscience data sharing options that exist today fulfill all the needs of neuroscientists.

"SCH:Smartphone Wound Image Parameter Analysis and Decision Support in Mobile Env PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Chronic wounds affect 6.5 million patients in the U.S., with an estimated treatment cost of $25 billion. Our team proposes research to advance our existing NSF-funded smartphone wound analysis system, which helps patients monitor their diabetic foot ulcers, providing them with instant feedback on healing progress. Our wound system analyzes a smartphone image of the patients' wound, detects the wound area and tissue composition, and generates a proprietary healing score by comparing the current image with a past image. Our envisioned chronic wound assessment system will support evidence-based decisions by the care team while visiting patients, and move wound care toward digital objectivity. We define digital objectivity as the synthesis of wound assessment metrics that are extracted autonomously from images in order to generate objective actionable feedback, enabling clinicians not trained as wound specialists to deliver ""standardized wound care"". Digital objectivity contrasts with the current practice of subjective, visual inspection of wounds based on physician experience. The first aim will develop image processing algorithms to mitigate wound analysis errors caused by non-ideal lighting in some clinical or home settings, and when the wound is photographed from arbitrary camera angles and distance. While our previous wound system worked well in ideal conditions, non-ideal lighting caused large errors and healthy skin was detected as the wound area in extreme cases. The second aim extends our existing wound analysis system that targets only diabetic wounds to handle arterial, venous and pressure ulcers, expanding the potential user. The third aim will synthesize algorithms that autonomously generate actionable wound decision rules that are learned from decisions taken by actual wound clinicians. This research is joint work of Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) (technical expertise in image processing, machine learning and smartphone programming) and University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) (clinical expertise on wounds, and wound patient recruitment to validate our work) RELEVANCE (See instructions): We propose research to advance our existing smartphone wound analysis system, which detects the wound area and tissue composition, and generates a proprietary healing score from a wound image.

"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and .

"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and .

"Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI Project Summary/Abstract Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) provides arguably the most comprehensive evaluation of the cardiovascular system; however, respiratory motion continues to adversely impact CMR, causing artifacts that lead to poor image quality, repeated scans, and decreased throughput, and thus represents a significant obstacle to clinical utility. For single-shot CMR, cardiac and breathing motions are “frozen” by limiting the acquisition to an end-diastolic window less than 200 ms. For first pass perfusion, breathing motion cannot be eliminated because data from 50 to 60 consecutive heartbeats are required to capture contrast dynamics. For other single-shot applications such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and parameter mapping, respiratory motion is introduced when the acquisition is repeated across several heartbeats to improve spatial and temporal resolution. To eliminate respiratory motion from single-shot images, non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) has been promoted as an attractive option that provides 100% acquisition efficiently. MOCO can be used either after the reconstruction or during the reconstruction. Such techniques, however, cannot account for through-plane motion, which can only be corrected prospectively, and can fail depending on image quality and the extent of motion. Prospective compensation of the respiratory motion has been recognized as an attractive alternative to existing gating and MOCO methods. Proposed methods use one or more navigator echoes—incompatible with or inefficient for many CMR protocols—to capture the respiratory motion and rely on simple parametric models that are inadequate to describe complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion. Due to these limitations, prospective methods have found limited applicability even in research settings. We propose a new framework to prospectively compensate respiratory motion. The proposed method, called PROspective Motion compensation using Pilot Tone (PROMPT), employs Pilot Tone technology and leverages machine learning principles to first learn complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion on a patient-specific basis and then prospectively compensate the motion by tracking the imaging plane, in real time, as a function of a Pilot Tone based respiratory signal. If successful, this synergistic combination of Pilot Tone and machine learning will lead to 100% efficiency for single-shot CMR exams performed under free-breathing conditions, will eliminate the need to setup navigator echoes, respiratory bellows, or other inefficient prospective gating measures, will minimize through-plane motion that can render the images non-diagnostic for CMR applications including fast-pass perfusion, parameter mapping, LGE, and coronary angiography, will provide a reliable surrogate measure of respiratory motion, and will facilitate highly accelerated compressive recovery. Project Narrative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many potential advantages over currently used imaging methods to diagnose heart disease, but MRI images can be ruined if the patient breathes during the scan. In this project, we will develop a method that is insensitive to breathing motion and compare it to existing methods. These efforts should lead to significant improvements in diagnosis of heart disease so that patients may benefit from appropriate treatment.",Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI,9587091,R21EB026657,"['Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Gadolinium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'healthy volunteer', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,185264,-0.014864456658953024
"Auto-Scope Software-Automated Otoscopy to Diagnose Ear Pathology ABSTRACT Acute infections of the middle ear (acute otitis media - AOM), are the most commonly treated childhood disease. Treatment is fueled by concern for complications and effects on children's cognitive and language development. The financial burden of AOM is estimated at more than $5 billion per year. Because AOM is so common, a major societal problem is the over-diagnosis and over-treatment of this disease, as a result of two factors: First, accurately diagnosing AOM is difficult, even for experienced primary care or ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physicians. Second, with a growing shortage of primary care physicians in the US, more Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants serve as first-line clinicians in primary care settings, but lack extensive training in otoscopy (i.e. clinical examination of the eardrum). Consequently, practitioners often err on the side of making a diagnosis of AOM and prescribing oral antibiotics. Over 8 million unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed annually, contributing to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and creating the largest number of pediatric medication-related adverse events. Many children with inaccurate diagnoses of AOM are referred to ENTs for surgical placement of ear tubes, and up to 70% of these cases are not indicated. Diagnosing AOM still depends on clinician subjectivity, based on a brief glimpse of the eardrum. This diagnostic subjectivity creates a critical barrier to progress in society's goal of decreasing healthcare costs and reducing over-diagnosis and over-treatment of AOM. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2013, devices are needed to assist in more accurate, consistent, and objective diagnosis of AOM. A simple and objective method of analyzing an image of a patient's ear to diagnose or rule out AOM would drastically reduce over-treatment. This project will fill that gap, by developing computer-assisted image analysis (CAIA) software that provides objective information to a clinician by analyzing eardrum images collected using currently available hardware. Based on previous work in applying similar methods to improve clinician performance in radiology and surgical pathology, our overarching hypothesis is that the incremental implementation of enhanced images, automated identification of abnormalities, and retrieval of similar cases will result in improved clinician diagnostic accuracy. In our preliminary work, we developed software, called Auto-Scope, which labels eardrums as “normal” versus “abnormal.” In this study, we propose two Specific Aims to improve diagnostic performance: Specific Aim #1: Create an enhanced composite image of the eardrum. Specific Aim #2: Use machine learning approaches for clinical decision support. The proposed research is relevant to public health because we are generating new methods aimed at improving diagnostic quality and reducing inter-observer variability, which will ultimately enable more accurate diagnosis and personalized therapeutic approaches for ear abnormalities. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission pertaining to the application of novel strategies that may improve human health, and NIDCD's mission of improving diagnosis and treatment of ear diseases, particularly otitis media.",Auto-Scope Software-Automated Otoscopy to Diagnose Ear Pathology,9669491,R21DC016972,"['Academy', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesteatoma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Cyst', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Ear Diseases', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hair', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nose', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Otitis Media', 'Otitis Media with Effusion', 'Otolaryngologist', 'Otoscopes', 'Otoscopy', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physician Assistants', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Side', 'Skin', 'Societies', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Tympanic membrane', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'acute infection', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cognitive development', 'computerized', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'digital video recording', 'effusion', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'middle ear', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overtreatment', 'personalized therapeutic', 'primary care setting', 'prototype', 'software development']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,252169,0.0006740417173129897
"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9640372,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,347584,0.0028303100120678926
"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry. This new technology will contribute to understanding complex processes in biological tissues that play a role in both health and disease.",Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry,9659552,UG3HL145593,"['Address', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Blood capillaries', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrospray Ionization', 'Ensure', 'Glass', 'Health', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Optics', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Slide', 'Solvents', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'biological systems', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human imaging', 'human tissue', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'innovation', 'interest', 'ionization technique', 'mass spectrometer', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'nano', 'nanoprobe', 'new technology', 'novel', 'operation', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'scale up', 'tool']",NHLBI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,UG3,2018,375000,0.01221838969006105
"New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging Project Summary To more fully exploit the basic science of mechanobiology as it pertains to breast cancer progression, the medical imaging field continues to search for fast, safe, and effective elasticity imaging methods. In this project we propose a fundamentally new approach to ultrasonic elasticity imaging in which the weak forces applied to patient tissues and the measured displacements that result are used to train a numerical model specifically for that patient. This constitutive model is developed using finite-element methods and neural networks assembled in a unique configuration called the AutoProgressive (AutoP) Method. AutoP “learns” complete stress and strain properties directly from sparse force and displacement measurements and without a mathematical model. Using quasi-static stimuli, AutoP exploits the fact that each force-displacement estimate contains information about mechanical properties at all locations in the contiguous tissue. From measurement information and conservation laws, AutoP generates an informational model without the need to make assumptions about tissue linearity, isotropy, or other material properties normally required when constructing images that display tissue mechanical properties. Once an accurate material-property model is formed by AutoP, we adopt a separate rheological model (e.g., Kelvin Voigt) to form viscoelastic parameters for image display. The AutoP method employs beamformed RF-echo acquisitions from which point displacements are estimated, applied compressional force sensed at the transducer surface, and tissue shape.  No other imaging method is capable of estimating all relevant stress fields, which gives AutoP unique capabilities. AutoP estimates the mechanical properties that one strives to obtain from an inverse problem approach, but AutoP is not a mathematical inverse technique and hence does not suffer from nonunique solutions. Without the need to assume material properties, AutoP can (in principle) model tissue properties in three dimensions and in time following large deformations in highly-nonlinear, anisotropic media. This R21 proposal focuses on establishing the feasibility of the AutoP methodology for subsequent clinical trials under future funding. At the completion of this two-year project, we will demonstrate a new tool for medical imaging capable of exploring the mechanical properties of tissues over a very broad range of deformations. We specifically target ultrasonic methods and quasi-static force stimuli in this project. However AutoP could eventually be coupled to other imaging modalities (e.g., MRE, OCE) or dynamic force-stimulus methods.  The scientific premise underlying AutoP is that we already record all of the information needed to generate a very broad range of elasticity images. The key to unlocking this information is to set aside mathematical models in favor of data-driven informational models built using the unique machine learning abilities of the AutoP method. If successful, AutoP will have a major influence on medical elasticity imaging methods. Project Narrative: A new type of machine-learning method is proposed for elasticity imaging of patient tissues that offers the potential to minimize many current limitations. If we are successful in this development, ultrasonic elasticity imaging would significantly improve in its ability to accurately represent mechanical properties of breast tissues, without any changes in current instrumentation and without increasing cost to the healthcare system or adding risk to patients.",New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging,9560761,R21EB023402,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Isotropy', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modulus', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonics', 'Writing', 'aged', 'base', 'breast cancer progression', 'breast imaging', 'cost', 'experience', 'healthy volunteer', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'imaging properties', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'mechanical properties', 'model building', 'model development', 'novel strategies', 'object shape', 'processing speed', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'viscoelasticity']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2018,179876,-0.0011871205017273865
"Non-invasive device to assist selecting the level-of-amputation in patients with peripheral arterial disease 1 Abstract  2  3 This is a Phase I SBIR proposal to develop a non-contact and non-invasive imaging device for assisting clinicians  4 in selecting the appropriate level-of-amputation (LOA) in limbs with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Surgeons  5 prefer to salvage as much limb tissue as possible during amputation to increase patient mobility while decreasing  6 morbidity and mortality. However, clinicians must balance this preference against the likelihood of primary wound  7 healing at a given level of amputation (LOA), which decreases with more distal amputations. There are no gold-  8 standard tests to aid clinicians in selecting the LOA in patients with PAD, therefore reported rates of re-  9 amputation in current practice are substantial. Up to 20% percent of above-the-knee amputations to 35% of 10 foot amputations require revision to a more proximal level. Furthermore, physician awareness of the risk for 11 re-amputation may lead to overly aggressive selection of LOA to more proximal levels in some cases. Indeed, 12 certain patients may receive amputations at a level more proximal than is necessary because their surgeon could 13 not confidently predict a high likelihood of healing at a more distal level. 14 15 In current practice, selection of LOA is determined qualitatively by clinical judgment of the surgeon using patient 16 history and physical exam. Others have developed quantitative tests that assess local microcirculation. These 17 technologies have not superseded clinical judgement. To address this critical problem, SpectralMD is 18 developing an imaging device that integrates multispectral imaging with a machine learning algorithm 19 to provide a quantitative assessment of the healing potential of a selected LOA whereas current clinical 20 practice is only capable of qualitative assessment. 21 22 We have proof-of-concept of our technology’s ability to characterize microvascular blood flow changes in a 23 patient with critical limb ischemia. In this proposal, we intend to establish the utility of our device for predicting 24 the healing potential of a clinician selected LOA by demonstrating the effectiveness of DeepView assessment 25 on a large set of pre-amputation images. To this end we will conduct a Phase I pilot study for the use of our 26 device in predicting the healing potential of a clinician selected LOA. This clinical study will develop a data set 27 for training the algorithm, and deliver a clear demonstration of feasibility for completing the development on an 28 algorithm that has high accuracy in predicting the healing potential of the proposed amputation site. Following 29 this work, we will apply for a Phase II proposal intended to finalize algorithm training, validate the algorithm 30 developed in Phase I, and establish a successful regulatory and commercialization pathway. Narrative In patients with peripheral arterial disease, reported rates of re-amputation due to non-healing of a primary amputation are very significant—approximately 20% of below-the-knee amputations require eventual revision, with even higher rates established for amputations at the level of the foot. There are no gold-standard tests for selection of level of amputation (LOA) to aid clinical judgment. To address this critical problem, SpectralMD is developing the DeepView-Gen2 imaging device that integrates multispectral imaging and a machine learning algorithm to quantitatively measure microvascular blood flow and tissue healing potential to assist in the clinical selection of LOA and minimize the incidence of re-amputation and its associated morbidity and mortality.",Non-invasive device to assist selecting the level-of-amputation in patients with peripheral arterial disease,9622035,R43HL142428,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Ankle', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Distal', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Equilibrium', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Incidence', 'Investigation', 'Ischemia', 'Judgment', 'Knee', 'Lead', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Microcirculation', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Postoperative Period', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary to', 'Site', 'Skin Tissue', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'Wound Healing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'commercialization', 'design', 'foot', 'healing', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'patient mobility', 'phase 1 study', 'preference', 'standard of care', 'success', 'wound']",NHLBI,"SPECTRAL MD, INC.",R43,2018,196561,0.000670456028337632

Two of these meetings, Optical Tomography and Spectroscopy (OTS) and Microscopy, Histopathology and Analytics (Microscopy) provide broad exposure to a very active multidisciplinary field in biomedical imaging and bioengineering focused on illness treatment and health enhancement. The interdisciplinary nature of the co- located meetings will provide cross-fertilization of concepts and techniques between fields with the resulting synergies obtained from such interactions. This proposal is to provide registration and travel support for students and early career professionals presenting at one of these topical meetings.  OTS will focus on new developments in diffuse optics, spectroscopy and other non- invasive tomographic imaging approaches, including the fields of diffuse optical tomography (DOT), photoacoustic tomography (PAT), optical coherence tomography (OCT), wavefront engineering to overcome scattering, as well as new developments in spectroscopic technologies.  Microscopy will include topics central to the development of optical microscopy and in vitro optical sensing for the clinic. Areas such as novel optical approaches, including computational optics, new image processing and segmentation techniques, development of decision-assistance algorithms via machine-learning and other strategies, testing technologies in pre-clinical models, applications to clinical samples, and validation in the clinic will be discussed. Optically enabled microfluidics are included in this track as well. The goal of these efforts should be towards clinical translation.  The general purpose of these meetings is to create an inclusive, open forum for the presentation of high-quality scientific research through plenary and technical sessions, short courses, panels, networking and special events. This method of face-to-face information sharing allows researchers to learn what others in their field and related disciplines are doing and to efficiently learn about new research, tools, and techniques that might be relevant to their work. It allows conversations with colleagues from different institutions around the world and engenders far reaching scientific collaborations – both domestic and international.

"mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment Project Summary NIH is increasing its investment in large mutli-center brain MRI studies via projects such as the recently announced BRAIN initiative. The success of these studies depends on the quality of MRIs and the resulting image measurements, regardless of sample size. Even though quality control of MRIs and corresponding measurements could be outsourced, most neuroscience studies rely on in-house procedures that combine automatically generated scores with manually guided checks, such as visual inspection. Implementing these procedures typically requires combining several open-source software systems. For example, the NIH NIAAA and BD2K funded Data Analysis Resource (DAR) of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) uses XNAT to consolidate the structural, diffusion, and functional MRIs acquired across five sites, and has also developed their own custom software package to comply with study requirements that called for a multi-tier, quality control (QC) workflow. However, these custom, one-off tools lack support for multi-site QC workflows as that would require a unified platform, design that supports collaboration and sharing, and strong cohesion between technologies. To improve the effectiveness of QC efforts specific to multi-center neuroimaging studies, we will develop a widely accessible and broadly compatible software platform that supports simplified creation of custom QC workflows in compliance with study requirements, provides core functionality for performing QC of medical images, and automatically generates documentation compliant with the FAIR principle, i.e., making scientific findings findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.  Specifically, our multi-site open-source software platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (mIQa) will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by leveraging open-source, state-of-the-art web interface technologies, such as a web-based dataset caching system, machine learning to aid in QC process, and an interactive electronic notebook platform. Users will be able to configure workflows that not only reflect the specific requirements of medical imaging studies but also minimize the time spent on labor-intensive operations, such as visually reviewing scans. Issue tracking technology will enhance communication between geographically-distributed team members, as they can easily share image annotations and receive automating notifications of outstanding QC issues. The system will be easy to deploy as it will be able to interface with various imaging storage backends, such as local file systems and XNAT. While parts of this functionality have been developed elsewhere, mIQa is unique as it provides a unified, standard interface for efficient QC setup, maintenance, and review for projects analyzing multiple, independently managed data sources.  The usefulness of this unique QC system will be demonstrated on increasing the efficiency of the diverse QC team of the multi-center NCANDA study. Narrative The goal of this proposal is to develop multi-site, open-source software for Medical Image Quality Assurance (mIQa) to address the QC needs of geographically diverse teams using small and large medical image-based studies alike. mIQa will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by levering open-source, state-of-the-art machine learning, data management, and web interface technologies.

"Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment Supplement Title: Deep learning-based methods for PET image reconstruction and segmentation to enhance radionuclide therapy dosimetry Abstract There is much recent interest in quantitative imaging of yttrium-90 (Y-90) for dosimetry because of the promise of novel Y-90 labelled radionuclide therapies. Deep learning methods are well suited for addressing the challenges of Y-90 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, where compared with diagnostic FDG PET, true coincidence count-rates are very low while random coincidences are high. The potential of deep learning-based algorithms to outperform conventional algorithms in medical imaging is well recognized, however research in applying these methods to nuclear medicine imaging modalities such as PET is very limited. The few studies applying deep learning to PET imaging have been mostly limited to post-reconstruction image processing/analysis for denoising and feature extraction, and not in the image formation/reconstruction process. Additionally, deep learning research in PET thus far have focused on improving diagnostic imaging, not quantitative imaging, which together with accurate lesion/organ segmentation are pre-requisite for accurate dosimetry. In this supplement, we propose to develop and evaluate deep learning-based image reconstruction and lesion/organ segmentation for low count PET applications such as Y-90 PET. Our approach starts with the raw projection data and utilizes a deep recurrent network in the image formation process. Because the two tasks are mutually dependent, our formalism takes the novel approach of joint reconstruction-segmentation with multi-modality (PET/CT) data. Specifically, we will 1) develop and evaluate Y-90 PET image reconstruction with a deep recurrent network for the regularizer, 2) develop and evaluate deep-learning based joint PET segmentation-reconstruction using multi- modal 90Y PET/CT data. To train/validate/test the proposed methods, we will use clinically realistic phantom measurements and simulations as well as leverage on existing patient data from the parent grant where thus far, PET data and radiologist defined morphologic liver/lesion contours for over 50 cases and 150 lesions are available. We will compare the new Y-90 PET reconstruction with the formulation we recently developed under the parent grant (using conventional untrained regularizers) that showed promising results but suffered from resolution- noise tradeoff. The expected outcome of this work is a well validated deep learning reconstruction- segmentation framework for challenging PET imaging applications where conventional methods are suboptimal. The proposed research is expected to result in new and accurate tools for quantitative image reconstruction and lesion/organ segmentation that have the potential to contribute significantly toward improving dosimetry in internal radionuclide therapy such as Yttrium- 90 radioembolization in liver malignancies. This study is relevant to public health because a dosimetry-guided personalized approach to radionuclide therapy is highly likely to substantially improve patient outcomes compared to current standard practice. !",Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment,9750430,R01EB022075,"['90Y', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Formulation', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radioembolization', 'Radionuclide therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'deep learning', 'dosimetry', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parent grant', 'personalized approach', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,102093,0.04188079224250601
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information.

"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care. Our goal is to integrate, enhance, and disseminate three cutting edge ultrasound acquisition, analysis, and display toolkits to create a new framework called Slicer+PLUS that will serve as a catalyst for research and product development into low-cost point-of-care ultrasound applications. In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9535994,R01EB021396,"['Abdomen', 'Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'catalyst', 'clinical translation', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'elastography', 'emergency service responder', 'hospital patient care', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'point of care', 'portability', 'product development', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'scoliosis', 'signal processing', 'software development', 'transmission process']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2018,444363,0.023210693832778444
"Automated Image Guidance for Diagnosing Skin Cancer With Confocal Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Melanoma is diagnosed in approximately 124,000 people and is responsible for about 10,000 deaths every year, in the USA. Dermatologists rely on visual and dermatoscopic examination to discriminate benign melanocytic lesions from malignant, resulting in high and highly variable benign-to-malignant biopsy ratios from 8:1 to 47:1, and millions of unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging has been proven for noninvasively guiding diagnosis of melanoma in several large clinical studies. RCM imaging at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) provides sensitivity of 92-88% and specificity of 71-84%. The specificity is 2 times superior to that of dermatoscopy. RCM imaging at the DEJ is now being implemented to rule out malignancy, reduce biopsy and guide treatment. However, this is currently at only a few sites, where there are highly trained experts who can ensure that imaging is appropriately performed and images are read correctly. These experts are a small international cohort of ""early adopter"" clinicians, who have worked with RCM technology during the past decade and have become highly skilled readers. For novice (non-expert) clinicians in the wider cohort who are keen to adopt RCM, learning to read images is challenging and requires substantial effort and time. Two major technical barriers underlie the dramatic variability in diagnostic accuracy among novice clinicians. Together they limit utility, reproducibility and wider adoption of RCM. The first is user dependent subjective variability in depths near the DEJ at which images are acquired, and the second is variability in interpretation of images. We propose to address these barriers with computational ""multi-faceted"" classification modeling (innovation), image analysis and machine learning algorithms. Our specific aims are: (1) to develop and evaluate algorithms for both dermatoscopic images and RCM depth-stacks, to enable automated standardized and consistent acquisition of RCM mosaics at the DEJ in melanocytic lesions; (2) to develop and evaluate algorithms to discriminate patterns of cellular morphology at the DEJ into two classes, benign lesions versus malignant (dysplastic lesions and melanoma); and (3) to test our algorithms on patients for acquisition of RCM mosaics and classification into those two groups, with statistical validation against pathology, with statistical validation against pathology. Preliminary studies show that our algorithms can delineate the DEJ with accuracy in the range ~3-13 μm in strongly pigmented dark skin and ~5-20 μm in lightly pigmented fair skin, and can detect cellular morphologic patterns with sensitivity in the range 67-80% and specificity 78-99%. Melanocytic lesions can be distinguished from the surrounding normal skin at the DEJ with 80% classification accuracy. We are a team of researchers from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern University and University of Modena. Our success will produce standardized imaging and analysis approaches, to advance RCM for noninvasive detection of melanoma. Furthermore, these approaches can be useful for non-melanoma skin cancers, cutaneous lymphoma and other skin disorders (wider impact). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is an optical imaging technology that can guide biopsy and enable noninvasive screening and diagnosis of skin cancers. However, visual reading and interpretation of RCM images requires substantial training for clinicians. We propose to develop computer-based algorithms to assist clinicians in reading images, serve as tools for training, and accelerate wider adoption of RCM technology by dermatologists.",Automated Image Guidance for Diagnosing Skin Cancer With Confocal Microscopy,9536759,R01CA199673,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cutaneous Lymphoma', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermoscopy', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Glass', 'Hypersensitivity skin testing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'International', 'Italy', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mosaicism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pigments', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image guided', 'innovation', 'melanoma', 'microscopic imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'optical imaging', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reflectance confocal microscopy', 'screening', 'skin disorder', 'success', 'tool']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2018,619539,0.02430132943464767
"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,9427452,R01EY028667,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cornea', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'mechanical properties', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,400000,-0.008446274658628725
"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,9476341,R01HL122484,"['3D ultrasound', '4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'perfusion imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,770494,0.023958751990153418
"2018 In Vivo Magnetic Resonance Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar PROJECT SUMMARY  The field of magnetic resonance (MR) is in the midst of a revolution. Disruptive external forces, such as the advent of powerful new Artificial Intelligence methods, coupled with a recent creative ferment in method development within the field, is changing the way we think about the acquisition, the reconstruction, and the interpretation of MR data. Meanwhile, MR has long been an indispensable tool not only for basic discovery but also for medical diagnostics, but the value proposition of clinical MR imaging is also changing, against the backdrop of a shifting healthcare landscape.  There is a palpable need to explore the full scope of these changes, in a forum that enables deep dives and focused discussion, without losing the necessary breath of perspective. While large meetings such as the annual scientific meeting of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) have the necessary breath, the sheer size and pace of such meetings work against the requisite focus. On the other hand, short focused workshops are better suited to the evaluation of progress in well-defined subfields.  The goal of this grant application is to support a high-impact conference with a time-tested format which is ideally suited to assess recent changes in the field of in vivo MR. The tenth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance will be held July 15 to 20, 2018, at Proctor Academy, in Andover, NH. Our GRC will also be associated with the first-ever trainee-organized and trainee-focused Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance, which will take place on the weekend before the GRC (July 14-15, 2018). The trainee seminar meshes well with our goal of preparing young scientists for a changing field and a changing world. We request funding to support graduate students and postdoctoral fellows attending these meetings, which will focus explicitly on the shifting role of MR in a rapidly changing world.  The GRC, subtitled “Challenging assumptions about MR technology and applications in a changing world,” will be led by Chair Daniel K. Sodickson, MD, PhD, and Vice Chair Jeff F. Dunn, PhD, and will build upon a rich history of In Vivo MR GRCs. The GRS, subtitled “The Changing World of Magnetic Resonance: Old Physics, New Techniques,” will be led by Chair Scott Beeman, PhD, and Vice Chair Carson Hoffman, BSc, and will further enhance the experience of trainees with tailored opportunities for mentorship, networking, and scientific exchange.  Specific aims of our 2018 GRC and GRS on In Vivo MR are as follows:  1. Explore disruptive forces and marshal disruptive innovation in the field of in vivo MR  2. Foster connections between MR and surrounding disciplines  3. Prepare young scientists to make a difference in a rapidly changing world PROJECT NARRATIVE Support is requested for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the tenth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance, scheduled for July 15-20, 2018, and the inaugural trainee- focused Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) to precede the conference on July 14-15, 2018. The GRC will be focused on “Challenging assumptions about MR technology and applications in a changing world,” with the goal of taking the measure of disruptive forces such as Artificial Intelligence, and marshaling disruptive innovations in the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of MR data. The companion GRS will have a related focus on “The changing world of magnetic resonance: old physics, new techniques,” and will provide trainees (who will attend the GRC as well) with opportunities for presentation of their work to peers and thought leaders, discussion of emerging areas of MR, and focused networking and mentorship.",2018 In Vivo Magnetic Resonance Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar,9608839,R13EB026933,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Anniversary', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Books', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'International', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marshal', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Palpable', 'Physics', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'c new', 'commune', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'design', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'meetings', 'method development', 'peer', 'posters', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIBIB,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2018,5000,0.007334962248971576
"Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) is a consortium of centers developing quantitative image features, which are proving to be valuable biomarkers of the underlying cancer biology and that can be used for assessing response to treatment and predicting clinical outcome. It is now important to discover the best quantitative imaging features for detection of response to therapeutics, to identify subtypes of cancer, and to correlate with cancer genomics. However, progress is thwarted by the lack of shared software algorithms, architectures, and resources required to compute, compare, evaluate, and disseminate these quantitative imaging features within the QIN and the broader community. We propose to develop the Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline (QIFP), a cloud-based, open source platform that will give researchers free access to these capabilities and hasten the introduction of quantitative image biomarkers into single- and multi-center clinical trials. The QIFP will facilitate assessment of the incremental value of new vs. existing image feature sets. It will also allow researchers to add their own algorithms to compute novel quantitative image features in their own studies and to disseminate them to the greater research community. To accomplish this: (1) We will create an expandable library of quantitative imaging feature algorithms capable of comprehensive characterization of the imaging phenotype of cancer. It will support a broad set of imaging modalities and algorithms implemented in a variety of languages, including algorithms that provide volumetric and time-varying assessment of lesion size, shape, edge sharpness, and pixel statistics. (2) We will build a cloud-based software architecture for creating, executing, and comparing quantitative image feature-generating pipelines, including algorithms in the library and/or those supplied by QIN or other researchers as plug-ins. QIFP will also have (a) a machine learning engine that lets users specify a dependent variable (e.g., progression-free survival) that the quantitative image features can used to predict, and (b) an evaluation engine that compares the utility of particular features for predicting the dependent variable. (3) We will assess the QIFP in four ways: (a) by its ability to recapitulate the role of known biomarkers in a related clinical trial, (b) by comparing linear measurement, metabolic tumor burden and novel combinations of the features in our library for predicting one-year progression-free survival, (c) by merging imaging features with known host-, drug- and tumor-based follicular lymphoma biomarkers in order to develop the most robust and integrative predictive model for patient outcomes, and (d) by using the QIFP to combine and to evaluate image feature algorithms developed by another QIN team and our own NCI- funded team in the study of radiogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer. The QIFP will fill a substantial gap in the science currently being carried out in the QIN and in the community by providing the tools and infrastructure to assess the value of novel quantitative imaging features of cancer, and will thereby accelerate incorporating new imaging biomarkers into single and multi-center clinical trials and into oncology practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop and evaluate a software platform that has major relevance for human health. Many investigators are pursuing image-based surrogates for response to therapy that could be used in clinical trials to predict their success/failure earlier and that are more accurate than existing surrogates. Our developments will facilitate sharing, assessing, and comparing combinations of image feature-generating software algorithms for predicting treatment response, survival, and tissue genomics, which will, in turn, greatly accelerate the development and acceptance of new and more relevant imaging surrogates for assessing cancer treatments.","Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers",9525301,U01CA187947,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Privatization', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Pythons', 'RNA Sequences', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical predictors', 'cloud based', 'disorder subtype', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vector', 'web based interface']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,593292,0.003032481285780749
"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,9513528,K23DK101687,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intestinal Fibrosis', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Steroids', 'Surgical Management', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'blood-based biomarker', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'glycoproteomics', 'improved', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'learning strategy', 'lecturer', 'matriculation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool development', 'translational impact', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2018,194368,0.0023885731676756726
"Deep radiomic colon cleansing for laxative-free CT colonography Project Summary/Abstract Colon cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, can be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC), also known as virtual colonoscopy, could substantially increase the capacity, safety, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. However, an FDA panel has recently identified two remaining concerns about CTC: patient adherence, and the detection of small polyps and flat lesions. Our clinical multi-center trial showed that laxative-free preparation by oral ingestion of a contrast agent (iodine) to indicate fecal materials for electronic cleansing (EC), followed by computer-aided detection (CADe), makes CTC easy to tolerate for patients while enabling the detection of ≥10 mm lesions at sensitivity comparable to that of optical colonoscopy. However, small polyps and flat lesions were a significant source of false negatives, because EC produced image artifacts that imitated such lesions. Because laxative-free CTC addresses the concern of patient adherence, the only remaining concern about CTC is the detection of small polyps and flat lesions. The goal of this project is to develop a novel multi-material deep-learning scheme, hereafter denoted as Deep- ECAD, that integrates EC and CADe for the detection of small polyps and flat lesions in laxative-free spectral CTC (spCTC), where spectral imaging and deep learning will be used to overcome the above limitations of conventional CTC. Our specific aims are to (1) establish a laxative-free ultra-low-dose spCTC image database, (2) develop a multi-material deep-learning method for EC, (3) develop deep radiomic detection of small polyps and flat lesions, and (4) evaluate the clinical benefit of Deep-ECAD with laxative-free cases. Successful development of the proposed Deep-ECAD scheme will substantially improve human readers’ performance in the detection of small polyps and flat lesions while minimizing the inconveniences of bowel preparation and radiation risk to patients. Such a scheme will make laxative-free spCTC a highly accurate and acceptable screening option for large populations, in particular, Medicare population, leading to an increased screening rate, promoting early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reducing mortality due to colon cancer.

"Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning Abstract In 2015, 1,658,370 new cancer cases are estimated to occur in the US, where nearly two-thirds will have radiation therapy (RT). Given that there are over 2,300 RT centers in the US, and current systems for contouring organs at risk (OARs) rely mostly on manual methods, there is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour OARs in medical images at a high degree of automation and for impacting current practice of RT planning. Encouraged by our strong Phase I results in thoracic and head and neck (H&N) body regions compared to current industry systems, we seek the accuracy, efficiency, and clinical acceptance of the contours output by our software product to significantly exceed those of existing systems. Our overall aim for Phase II is to advance the algorithms and prototype software developed in Phase I into a leading commercial software product, and demonstrate its efficacy in multiple medical centers across the country with diverse populations. Phase II specific aims are three-fold: (1) Further advance the automatic anatomy recognition algorithms from Phase I using advanced deep learning techniques. (2) Develop a cloud-based software auto contouring service. (3) Perform clinical evaluation of the new software on H&N and thoracic cases. Aim 1 will be accomplished in three stages: (a) Automating the process of defining the body region on given patient CT studies, which is currently done manually in our system, via a new concept of virtual landmarks using deep learning techniques. (b) Improving object recognition/ localization accuracy from the current 2 voxels for “good” quality data sets to 1 voxel and from 4-5 voxels for “poor” quality data sets to 2-3 voxels by using virtual landmarks to learn object relationships. (c) Improving object delineation by combining object localization methods with deep learning techniques applied to the vicinity of the localized objects to bring boundary distance accuracy within 1 voxel. Aim 2 will be achieved by developing a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service model to implement the software that incorporates the algorithms. To accomplish Aim 3, an evaluation study involving four academic RT centers will be undertaken to assess the efficiency, accuracy, and acceptability of the contours output by the new software. To assess efficiency, contouring time taken by the current clinical process will be compared to the time taken by the new software method plus any manual adjustment needed. Accuracy will be assessed by comparing software output to carefully prepared ground truth contours. Acceptability will be determined by conducting a blinded reader study, where an acceptability score (1-5) is given by radiation oncologists to software produced contours, ground truth contours, and contours produced by the normal clinical process, and comparing these scores. Expected clinical outcomes are significantly improved clinical efficiency/ acceptability of contouring compared to current practice.

"ClearScope Combined in vivo and ex vivo three‐dimensional (3D) whole‐brain imaging of non‐transgenic and transgenic animal models holds the promise of novel insights into neural network connectivity patterns. With regard to ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole‐brain datasets, the best approach is brain clearing followed by whole‐brain light sheet microscopy (LSM) because of its unique combination of speed, 3D resolving power, and low phototoxicity compared to confocal and multiphoton microscopy. Unlike other methods, the combined brain clearing / LSM approach makes it possible to use intact tissue and retain all intracellular connections within the brain structure. However, LSM systems commercially available are not suitable for ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole‐brain datasets in advanced connectomics research. Recently, Dr. Raju Tomer (Dept. Biol. Sci., Columbia Univ., New York, NY) developed light sheet theta microscopy (LSTM), essentially a unique arrangement of two light sheets oblique to the specimen and one detection objective perpendicular to the specimen. This novel microscope is the basis for a number of capabilities in LSTM that are not all available with any other commercially available LSM systems. The LSTM technology has distinct advantages over confocal and other light sheet microscopes, including the unmatched ability to image thicker tissue specimens over a larger lateral area (XY) at higher optical resolutions, while maintaining fast imaging speed, high imaging quality, and low photo‐bleaching. This promising technology serves as the basis for this Lab to Marketplace proposal to develop the ClearScope™, which refines and improves Dr. Tomer's original LSTM system to create a successful commercial microscope for wide‐spread adoption. The key technical objectives for developing the ClearScope as a commercial product include creating and testing (i) a ClearScope prototype based on an optimized microscope hardware design; (ii) novel microscope hardware components for the ClearScope, comprising a novel chamber that contains the investigated specimen and the immersion medium, and a novel detection objective changer; (iii) novel control and image acquisition software for the ClearScope; and importantly, (iv) novel software that surpasses the existing state‐of‐the‐art technology to assemble acquired image stacks into large 3D image volumes exceeding 10TB without need to downsample the image information. The production version of the ClearScope will benefit the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general by improving understanding of neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large‐scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. In particular, this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases. The proposed project will enable important new research, that is not currently feasible, into whole-brain neural network connectivity patterns by means of ex vivo light microscopic imaging of three-dimensional whole-brain datasets. To achieve this, the proposed project will create the ClearScope light sheet microscope featuring signficant capabilities to image thick specimens of unlimited lateral (XY) size with resolution that permits investigatons of subcellular structures to distinguish adjacent neuronal processes (axons, dendrites, varicosities and dendritic spines). Because these features are not all available with any commercially available light sheet microscopes, the benefit for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be the possibility to better understand neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions, ultimately resulting in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases.",ClearScope,9559081,R44MH116827,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Lateral', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'New York', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Phototoxicity', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rattus', 'Refractive Indices', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Varicosity', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'ex vivo imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R44,2018,556615,-0.0026427563021485584
"Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Image evaluation of skeletal muscle biopsies is a procedure essential to research and clinical practice. Although widely used, several major limitations exist with respect to current muscle image morphometric measurement, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, retrieval, and mining procedures: 1) Although traditional morphometric parameters, such as cross-sectional area (CSA) and minimum Feret diameter, etc., serve as critical indicators for assessing muscle function, current measurements are still largely based on manual or semi-automated methods, leading to significant labor costs with large potential inter-observer variability. 2) The current archiving of muscle images is still mainy based on outdated tools such as Excel spreadsheets and computer file folders. Given a new muscle image, it is almost impossible to quickly cross-compare, visualize, query, search, and retrieve previous cases exhibiting similar image contents with comparable morphometric measures, for the purpose of either discovering novel biological co-correlations at benchside, or providing personalized diagnosis and prognosis at bedside. 3) Although a typical muscle image often contains millions of data points (pixels), in clinical practice, doctors often condense this rich information into one or two diagnostic labels and discard the rest. Novel image markers, which are not always apparent through visual inspections or not manually quantifiable, but potentially represent critical diagnostic and prognostic values for precision medicine, have not been rigorously examined. Similarly, in basic science research, only a very limited number of known measures (e.g., CSA) are considered. Some non-traditional measures, such as myofiber shapes that hold the potential to serve as new indicators of muscle functions, are not fully investigated. 4) Current muscle image analysis and searching functions are fairly low throughput. As a frontier research area, Cloud computing can handle big image data in a distributed manner by providing high-throughput computational power. However, its application to muscle images has never been explored. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, bioinformatics image mining, and Cloud computing. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Develop the automated morphometric measurement unit, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) unit, and the image archiving and visualization unit. 2) Develop the advanced bioinformatics image mining unit to assist in the rapid discovery and validation of new image markers. 3) Develop the Cloud computing unit to enable big image data processing and searching functions. Disseminate this freely available, Cloud-enabled imaging informatics system to muscle research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to develop and disseminate an advanced Cloud-enabled imaging informatics tool - MuscleMiner. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, and bioinformatics image mining. The goal of MuscleMiner is to offer a freely available and powerful tool to help all clinician and basic scienc muscle researchers in their daily work. Beyond fast, objective, reproducible, and automated morphometric measurements, the impact of MuscleMiner will be multiplied by laboratories using the CBIR and visualization units (Aim 1), bioinformatics image mining unit (Aim 2), and Cloud-computing unit (Aim 3) to deeply mine and fully utilize the rich information embedded in large collections of muscle images.",Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus,9542210,R01AR065479,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Exhibits', 'Fascicle', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Pathologic', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Shapes', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'frontier', 'image archival system', 'image visualization', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'personalized diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic value', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'wasting', 'whole slide imaging']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2018,377571,0.05034654207944446
"Hamamatsu Nanozoomer S60 Digital Whole Slide Scanner Project Summary/Abstract This application is for a shared instrumentation grant from the Light Microscope Imaging Facility at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) School of Medicine (SOM) to acquire a fully automated, high-capacity, high- resolution Hamamatsu Nanozoomer S60 slide scanner that can accommodate both brightfield and fluorescence imaging in single-slide and double-slide formats. We also request MicroDimensions 3D reconstruction and alignment software packages for manipulating and analyzing the whole slide images produced with the scanner. We need to replace a scanner that is not functioning properly. Our well-established shared core facility supports NIH-funded investigators by giving them access to state-of-the-art microscopy technologies that enhance collaborative, multidisciplinary research. Acquisition of this instrument will have a high impact on the biomedical research at CWRU and expand the scope of our NIH-funded projects. Several projects have been identified that will utilize the scanner and its associated analyses programs. These include: the genetic mechanisms underlying skin fibrosis and cranial bone development (Atit); the mechanisms behind the lifelong functions of transcription factors in axonal growth and architecture (Deneris); deep-learning for histologic image predictors of various diseases (Madabhushi); the development of diagnostic probes to discriminate between glioma subtypes for screening and survival therapies (Brady-Kalnay); the role of progesterone receptors in the control of parturition and the development of therapies to prevent preterm birth (Messiano); the mechanisms by which breast cancer stem cells overcome metastatic latency leading to disease recurrence and the biomarkers that could potentially identify those tumors likely to undergo this process (Schiemann); and the significance of cholesterol-related proteins in brain and retinal function (Pikuleva). Many additional projects of minor users and others at CWRU are anticipated. All of the proposed projects are in need of a high-capacity automated scanner acquiring whole slide images so that analyses can be applied to tissues that cover hundreds of fields of view, rather than the single regions of interest that can be acquired on a standard microscope. Narrative This proposal seeks to acquire a new, state-of-the-art high-speed, high content digital slide scanner for high resolution cellular and biomarker identfcation across large tissue areas. The dual mode (fluorescence and brightfield) allows flexibility in marker visualization while the software allows the automated alignment of whole slide images for multi-stain analysis and 3d reconstruction of serial section for in-depth analysis of specimens.

"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,9517057,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging study', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'success', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2018,169609,0.008414334554756042
"Quantitative topographic endoscopy for improved screening of non-polypoid colorectal neoplasms Project Summary This project will create and assess new optical imaging and computational technologies with the goal of improving the detection rates of precancerous, non-polypoid lesions during colonoscopy screening. Identifying and removing these subtle lesions is critical to improving the protective value of colonoscopy in reducing mortality from colorectal cancer. However, current approaches to non-polypoid lesion detection are largely unsuccessful because they are time-consuming and require specialized training (chromoendoscopy), or they start with poor image contrast (software analysis of conventional video). This project focuses on developing a novel technique, called quantitative topographic endoscopy (QTE), that optically measures colon surface properties via a modified commercial colonoscope. The key innovation in this proposal is to utilize structured illumination and build on concepts from computer vision and optical engineering to acquire high-resolution 3D images of the colon surface through a custom endoscope. The project will be implemented through three specific aims: (1) develop a miniaturized, quantitative, high-resolution topography system, (2) implement QTE in a modified commercial colonoscope ready for clinical testing, and (3) determine the validity of QTE in a phantom model and its clinical feasibility in a pilot human study. QTE systems developed in this project will be tested in tissue-mimicking phantoms with a goal of achieving better than 1-mm height sensitivity, in ex-vivo resected colon samples with a goal of accurately reconstructing surface shapes from a complex tissue, and in a pilot human study with the goal of obtaining surface topography non-polypoid lesions. Beyond increasing non-polypoid lesion detection rates, QTE has the potential to address other limitations of colonoscopy, including preventing missed polypoid lesions, classifying lesions for resect-and-discard strategies, and improving colonoscopy quality metrics. Additionally, the development of a QTE system that is approved for human studies will serve as a platform for future clinical assessment of other optical techniques such as spatial frequency domain imaging and speckle imaging in a variety of gastroenterology applications. Project Narrative Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Screening colonoscopy can significantly reduce mortality from colorectal cancer but is limited by high miss rates for precancerous non- polypoid lesions.

"Fast and Robust Low-Dose X-Ray CT Image Reconstruction Abstract:  The use of CT scans has recently increased, for example, in virtual colonoscopy, CT cardiac screening, screening of the lung in smokers, whole-body CT in asymptomatic patients, and CT imaging of children. Shortening of the scanning time to around 1 second, eliminating the strict need for the subject to remain still or be sedated, is one of the main reasons for the large increase in the pediatric population. CT scans of children have been estimated to produce non-negligible increases in the probability of lifetime cancer mortality, leading to calls for the use of reduced current settings for CT scans of children. For these reasons, the CT industry has put in a lot of effort to develop low-dose CT. One active area of research is methods to reduce the radiation counts by applying adaptive collimation to block unnecessary x-ray photons. Another active area of research is the development of more robust image reconstruction algorithms that are less sensitive to noise for low-count data.  This grant proposal is focused on the second approach — development of fast and robust reconstruction algorithms. It is known that some iterative image reconstruction algorithms outperform the analytical filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm in terms of producing less-noisy images with the same data set. One disadvantage of these iterative algorithms is their long computation time, making them impractical in a real- world CT reconstruction tasks. For this reason, the FBP algorithm is still the main work horse for CT applications.  The main goal of the proposed research is to develop fast and robust iterative-algorithms so that their computation time is at the same order of an analytic FBP algorithm, using experimental low-dose phantom, cadaver data, and low-dose cancer screen chest CT patient data to perform comparison studies. We will answer the question: When the fast and robust algorithms are used, how much can the CT dose be reduced while retaining the image quality of a standard-dose CT produced by the conventional FBP?  This R15 project provides Weber State University (WSU) computer engineering and computer science students with hands-on opportunities and experiences of performing real-world research in the field of healthcare. It will stimulate the interests of students so that they consider a career in biomedical and bioengineering field/industry. Narrative:  CT dose is currently a major concern for the general public. Low-dose CT is under development. The proposed research will focus on developing fast, robust and practical image reconstruction methods that are able to produce a standard CT image using a lower CT dose.",Fast and Robust Low-Dose X-Ray CT Image Reconstruction,9440734,R15EB024283,"['Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cadaver', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collimator', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equus caballus', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Inferior', 'Internships', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Probability', 'Radiation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'interest', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'mortality', 'parallel computer', 'professor', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'tomography', 'university student']",NIBIB,WEBER STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2018,88321,-0.004874603750516371
"Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT Project Summary: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. Diagnosis and stratification of disease phenotypes are important in order to decipher the effects of novel therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individuals. Few computerized diagnostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with visual and surgical lung biopsy; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good predictive models with localized region exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use as a derivative dataset the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF and 266 patients with IPF suspected, but not IPF based on HRCT and the surgical biopsy who have participated in multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for high through-put quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier with features of anatomic distribution and reproducible imaging features expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score, testing on separate data from in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitial Lung Disease Program. Furthermore, the second aim is to develop a rate of progression at local region and to aggregate predictive models using Cox proportional regression models, which will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that diagnose and anticipate disease course in patients with IPF and subdividing patients into more homogeneous groups prior to the development of significant respiratory impairment. We anticipate that models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions to define more homogeneous cohorts for purposes of testing new targeted therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression. Relevance to Public Health: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rate of progression is highly variables, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using new drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to diagnose and predict disease course robustly in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with IPF and non-IPF with reducing chance of lung biopsy and predict slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more time to treat patients and timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.",Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT,9592308,R21HL140465,"['Acute', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stable Disease', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'data archive', 'digital imaging', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'functional decline', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2018,113241,-0.017814436675419123
"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management. Aim 3) Disseminate software and knowledge, via a) deploying our software to the clinic at Penn as well as to selected collaborating institutions, in order to test and further refine the software accordig to feedback; b) freely distributing our software to the research community; c) organizing various educational activities for both clinicians and informaticians, and setting up and maintaining support forums. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advanced computer analysis methodology for interpretation of radiologic images of cancer, emphasizing brain and breast cancer. The functionality of the software will substantially transcend limitations of current analysis of cancer images, and will open the way for more precise and effective surgical planning as well as for more specific diagnosis of cancer based on its imaging characteristics, eventually leading to individualized medicine.",Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer,9552091,U24CA189523,"['Algorithmic Software', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational Activities', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Industrialization', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Transcend', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging probe', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular subtypes', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'web site']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U24,2018,609010,-0.059912351722170284
"New Approach to Quantitative Beta Amyloid Imaging Using PET Summary This project seeks to prove the commercial feasibility of a new approach to analyzing dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data that would improve sensitivity, quantitative accuracy, and accessibility of imaging the biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent progress in understanding the nature of neurodegenerative diseases — especially evidence that the onset of cognitive symptoms of AD can be mitigated —amplify the critical need of improved quantitative evaluation of AD biomarkers. Dynamic PET may be the most accurate modality capable of achieving this goal. However, current strategies of analyzing dynamic PET images either require complex acquisition protocols with invasive arterial blood sampling procedures or rely on accuracy-degrading approximations such as compartment modeling. We have developed Intelligent Dynamics-Driven Quantitative Diagnostics (IDDQD), a novel processing approach based on factor analysis of dynamic structures with partial clustering used to initiate the process. We have shown that an early version of IDDQD can extract blood and tissue tracer dynamics and the corresponding spatial distributions from 11C-PIB PET scans. SolvingDynamics Inc plans to offer a Research-as-a-Service data processing workflow that will apply IDDQD to dynamic brain PET datasets acquired by the customers, producing accurate quantitative tracer dynamics time-activity curves (TACs) and the distribution of the targeted tissues, including the AD biomarkers beta-amyloid and tau. Our proprietary algorithm does not require the tracer dynamics model to achieve steady state, so a shorter scan can be used to generate results of similar or better accuracy than those produced by current approaches, such as reference tissue- based methods. In this proposal, SolvingDynamics seeks to prove the feasibility of our proposed approach by comparing the diagnostics obtained using IDDQD analysis of dynamic PET data and those obtained from independent measurements. A subcontract group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has been conducting dynamic 11C-PIB PET studies for several years and has accumulated over 70 cases with PET data matched to both cognitive-memory tests and to post-mortem pathology studies. SolvingDynamics will retrospectively apply its analysis technique to these datasets and compare its computed tissue distributions to standardized uptake volume ratio (SUVR) and distribution volume ratio (DVR) data. A subset of 20 dynamic 11C-PIB PET datasets ranging in length from 15 to 90 minutes will also be analyzed in order to validate the feasibility of reducing the imaging time. In addition, similar studies aimed at reducing imaging time with IDDQD will be performed for 20 PET scans acquired using 18F-AV1451 tracer to image tau. PROJECT NARRATIVE Positron emission tomography image analysis methodology to be validated in this project aims to improve sensitivity and specificity of tissue analysis in dynamic positron emission tomography, improving diagnosis of Alzheimer's diseases and other neurodegenerative disorders. The main benefits are expected in medical research developing treatments for dementia and in clinical diagnosis, allowing early detection of the disease with less cost and reduced radiation dose to the patients.",New Approach to Quantitative Beta Amyloid Imaging Using PET,9557192,R43AG059500,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Autopsy', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injections', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'amyloid imaging', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'heuristics', 'human subject', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'molecular imaging', 'neuropathology', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiotracer', 'tau Proteins', 'uptake']",NIA,"SOLVINGDYNAMICS, INC.",R43,2018,149871,-0.04178951604738906
"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue identification and quantification plays a significant role in the study of aging and age-related diseases. For example, the accumulation of fat in the human body and its regional distribution with aging is associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in muscle composition are strongly linked to decline of muscle strength, decreased mobility caused by aging, or musculoskeletal disorders. Especially interesting is analysis of longitudinal changes of morphometric descriptors that is significant for studying the aging process and for the diagnosis and prevention of age-related diseases.  Medical imaging has emerged as a major tool for estimation of body composition mainly due to being non- invasive and producing multi-dimensional information. Nowadays MRI and CT acquisition is a central component of clinical trials. An abundance of imaging data is collected, but this wealth of information has not been utilized to full extent. Therefore research on image analysis techniques for tissue quantification that are reproducible and can be used on large-scale clinical trials is of particular importance.  The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse body composition data from modern MRI and CT imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who are healthy versus those who are not. The goal of our work is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the abdomen and lower extremities and to study the relationship between body morphological changes and age-related pathologies.  We will build upon recent advances in medical image computing to segment muscle, regional adipose tissue, and bone in clinical CT and MRI scans. We will also develop image registration procedures to achieve intra- and inter-subject correspondence and make efficient use of information provided by multi-modal and multi-temporal imaging data collected in clinical trials (aim 1). After these methods have been developed, we will address the hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging can increase the prognostic accuracy of age-related pathologies (aim2). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic and affect the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million don't know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function. This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition and its changes with increasing age to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES,9449456,SC3GM113754,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delaware', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Techniques', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age related', 'biophysical model', 'bone', 'clinical imaging', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'statistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY,SC3,2018,64155,0.012645454976479205
"Quantitative Low-Dose PET Imaging Project summary Quantitative PET has become increasingly important in clinical management and research, in particular for predicting and assessing response to therapy for cancer patients. Current PET protocols involve injection of PET tracers that typically result in ~6-7 mSv radiation dose to patients. For patients who require multiple repeated PET scans to monitor the response to therapy, and for patients who need PET scans with two or more tracers (e.g., FDG + FLT) to optimally predict response to therapy, it is critical to reduce the radiation dose from the PET tracer injection, while still maintaining the quantitative accuracy and image quality for cancer management. When reducing injection dose, the PET images will have higher noise due to fewer detected counts, which will subsequently introduce errors in quantitative measurements. For moving organs and tumors such as those in the lung and abdomen, respiratory motion can substantially degrade quantitative accuracy, so motion correction is required. Conventional motion correction uses a gating strategy that rebins the PET data, resulting in substantially higher noise in each gate. More advanced methods incorporate motion vector estimation in the image domain for post-registration or motion compensated image reconstruction using all detected events without increasing noise. The motion vectors need to be derived from gated PET, which are even noisier when using a reduced tracer injection in low-dose studies, imposing substantial challenges for accurate and reliable voxel-by-voxel motion vector estimation. In dynamic PET studies with clinical cardiac tracers and other novel oncology and neurology tracers, quantification is even more challenging for low-dose PET as each dynamic frame only contains a small fraction of detected events so the high image noise will affect the determination of image-derived input functions and can lead to bias and high noise in parametric images. In this project, to reduce image noise and maintain quantitative accuracy in PET, we propose to develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple innovative imaging methods for low-dose PET data to achieve comparable quantitative accuracy as full-dose PET. While the imaging developments are generally applicable to all PET tracers in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, since cancer is the primary clinical application of PET, we will focus our investigation and optimization in this project on three lung cancer imaging tracers at different clinical adoption stages as examples: 1) 18F-FDG as a routine clinical tracer, 2) 18F-FMISO for hypoxia studies as a tracer for human research, and 3) 18F-PD-L1 that specifically binds to human PD-L1 in tumors and other organs as a recent first-in-human tracer. For each tracer, we will investigate 1) static PET, 2) gated and respiratory motion corrected PET, and 3) dynamic PET. Project narrative Patient radiation dose is a major concern in PET imaging. This project will be an important step to develop and standardize low-dose PET imaging methods and provide guidance for clinical practice, research studies, and both single and multiple site clinical trials for PET dose reduction.

"Fully-automated lesion characterization in ultrawide-field retinal images Abstract  In this grant application we propose to develop, EyeReadUWF, a fully automated tool for lesion characterization in ultra-widefield scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (UWF SLO) images. In recent times non mydriatic UWF SLO imaging has been shown to be a promising alternative to conventional digital color fundus imaging for grading of diabetic eye diseases, with advantages including 130°-200° field-of-view showing more than 80% of the retina in a single image, no need for multiple fields, multiple flashes, or refocusing between field acquisitions, ability to penetrate media opacities like cataract, and lower rate of ungradable images. UWF SLO images are particularly suitable for detecting predominantly peripheral lesions (PPLs), which have been associated with higher risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression. Accurate quantification of presence and extent of PPLs can only be done by a robust automated tool that is specifically designed for the pseudo-colored images of UWF SLO modality. EyeReadUWF will automatically characterize lesions in pseudo colored UWF images while handling possible artifacts from eyelashes and determine the lesion predominance in peripheral and central regions of UWF image. The ability to accurately quantify the presence and extent of predominantly peripheral lesions in UWF SLO images can enable clinicians to triage patients with higher risk of DR progression and onset of PDR, have a positive impact on diabetic patient management, and aid drug discovery research. Narrative The proposed tool, EyeReadUWF, will perform automated lesion characterization in ultra- widefield scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (UWF SLO) images to quantify the presence and extent of predominantly peripheral lesions (PPLs), which have been associated with higher risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression. To the best of our knowledge, no commercial automated analysis tool is currently indicated for UWF SLO images.

"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images.

"Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the advent of whole slide digital scanners, histopathology slides can be digitized into very high-resolution digital images, realizing a new ""big data"" stream that can potentially rival ""omics data"" in size and complexity. Just as with the analysis of high-throughput genetic and expression data, the application of sophisticated image analytic tools and data pipelines can render the often passive data of digital pathology (DP) archives into a powerful source for: (a) rich quantitative insights into cancer biology and (b) companion diagnostic decision support tools for precision medicine. Digital pathology enabled companion diagnostic tests could yield predictions of cancer risk and aggressiveness in a manner similar to molecular diagnostic tests. However, prior to widespread clinical adoption of DP, extensive evaluation of clinical interpretation of DP imaging (DPI) and accompanying decision support tools needs to be undertaken. Wider acceptance of DPI by the cancer community (clinical and research) is hampered by lack of a publicly available, open access image informatics platform for easily viewing, managing, and quantitatively analyzing DPIs. While some commercial platforms exist for viewing and analyzing DPI data, none of these platforms are freely available. Open source image viewing/management platforms that cater to the radiology (e.g. XNAT) and computational biology communities are typically not conducive to handling very large file sizes as encountered with DPI datasets.  This multi-PI U24 proposal seeks to expand on an existing, freely available pathology image viewer (Sedeen Image Viewer) to create a pathology informatics platform (PIIP) for managing, annotating, sharing, and quantitatively analyzing DPI data. Sedeen was designed as a universal platform for DPI (by addressing several proprietary scanner formats and ""big data"" challenges), to provide (1) reliable and useful image annotation tools, and (2) for image registration and analysis of DPI data. Additionally, Sedeen has become an application for cropping large DPIs so that they can be input into programs such as Matlab or ImageJ. Sedeen has been freely available to the public for three years, with over 160 unique users from over 20 countries.  Building on the initial successes of Sedeen and its existing user base, our intent is to massively increase dissemination of DPI and algorithms in the cancer research community and clinical trial efforts, as well as to contribute towards the adoption of a rational and standardized set of DP operational conventions. This unique project will allow end users with different needs and technical backgrounds to seamlessly (a) archive and manage, (b) share, and (c) visualize their DPI data, acquired from different sites, formats, and platforms. The PIIP will provide a unified user interface for third party algorithms (nuclear segmentation, color normalization, biomarker quantification, radiology-pathology fusion) and will allow for algorithmic evaluation upon data arising from a plurality of source sites. By partnering with professional societies, we envision that the PIIP user base will expand to include the oncology, pathology, radiology, and pharmaceutical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will result in the further development of advanced functionality of the already existing digital pathology image informatics platform (PIIP) with an established user-base for cancer research. Such an enhanced platform will provide the much-needed foundation for advancing (a) routine clinical adoption of digital pathology for primary diagnosis and (b) training and validation of companion diagnostic decision support systems based off histopathology. Thus, the project is aligned with the NCI's goal to foster innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving human health.","Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management",9548627,U24CA199374,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Community Trial', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Felis catus', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Language', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Students', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'annotation  system', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research site', 'companion diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput analysis', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'open source', 'pathology imaging', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'repository', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user friendly software', 'validation studies']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U24,2018,573677,0.021255942993133114
"Improving Melanoma Pathology Accuracy through Computer Vision Techniques - the IMPACT Study ABSTRACT  This proposal will help to improve the accuracy of diagnosing melanoma and melanocytic lesions. The incidence of melanoma is rising faster than any other cancer, and ~1 in 50 U.S. adults will be diagnosed with melanoma this year alone. Our research team has noted substantial diagnostic errors in interpreting skin biopsies of melanocytic lesions; pathologists disagree in up to 60% of cases of invasive melanoma, which can lead to substantial patient harm. Our proposal uses computer technology to analyze whole-slide digital images of glass slides in order to improve the diagnosis of melanocytic lesions. Using data from an ongoing NIH study, we will digitize and study a set of 240 skin biopsy cases that includes a full spectrum of benign to invasive melanoma diagnoses. Each biopsy case has a reference consensus diagnosis developed by a panel of three international experts in dermatopathology and new data will be available from 160 practicing U.S. community pathologists, providing a uniquely rich clinical database that is the largest of its kind. This project will include novel computational techniques, including the detection of both cellular-level and architectural entities, and the use of a combination of feature-based and deep neural network classifiers. Our specific aims are: 1. To detect cellular-level entities in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions. 2. To detect structural (architectural) entities in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions. 3. To develop an automated diagnosis system that can classify digitized slide images into one of five possible diagnostic classes: benign; atypical lesions; melanoma in situ; invasive melanoma stage T1a; and invasive melanoma stage ≥T1b. In our proposed study, we are innovatively using computer image analysis algorithms and machine learning. This technology has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of pathologists by providing an analytical, undeviating review to assist humans in this difficult task. Project Narrative Diagnosis of melanoma and melanocytic skin biopsy lesions is among the most challenging areas of pathology and our preliminary data shows concerning levels of errors among pathologists. Our ultimate goal is to use innovative computer image analysis and machine learning techniques to reduce diagnostic errors and save patients' lives. The first step towards this goal is a correct diagnosis of melanoma.",Improving Melanoma Pathology Accuracy through Computer Vision Techniques - the IMPACT Study,9322408,R01CA200690,"['Adult', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Benign', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Caring', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Dermatopathology', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mitotic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Precancerous melanosis', 'Process', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Skin', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maltreatment', 'melanocyte', 'melanoma', 'novel', 'skin lesion', 'stem', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,30900,-0.0012755469640195576
"Extracting rich information from biological images Project Summary    Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopes to image samples.

"Multidimensional MRI-based Big Data Analytics to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder.

"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and . These activities will be targeted at both XNAT users and developers. RELEVANCE Medical imaging is one of the key methods used by biomedical researchers to study human biology in health and disease.

"Deep radiomic decision support system for colorectal cancer Project Summary/Abstract Computer-aided detection (CADe) has been shown to increase readers’ sensitivity and reduce inter-observer variance in detecting abnormalities in medical images. However, they prompt relatively large numbers of false positives (FPs) that readers find tedious to review and, during this process, the readers can incorrectly dismiss true lesions prompted correctly to them by CADe systems. Thus, there is a demand for an advanced decision support system that would provide not only high detection sensitivity, but also high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a lesion. In this project, we propose to improve the detection specificity of CADe by deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) that can analyze the extrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the context of local anatomy, of target lesions, whereas current CADe systems consider only the intrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the shape and texture of detected lesions. Further, we can use DCNNs to provide an explanation of why a specific location was prompted by using anatomically meaningful object categories with similar-image retrieval of past diagnosed cases. In this project, we will focus on computed tomographic colonography (CTC), which is a minimally invasive screening method for early detection of colorectal lesions to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC), which is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Historically, however, only adenomas were believed to be precursors of CRC. Recent studies have revealed a molecular pathway where also serrated lesions can develop into CRC. Recent studies have indicated that CTC can detect serrated lesions accurately based upon the phenomenon called contrast coating. Thus, the goal of this project is to develop a deep radiomic decision support (DeepDES) system that leverages deep learning for providing high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of colorectal lesions, in particular, serrated lesions, and for providing diagnostic information that explains why a specific location was prompted as a lesion to assist readers in assessing detected lesions correctly. To achieve the goal, we will explore the following specific aims: (1) Develop a radiomic deep-learning (RAID) scheme for the detection of colorectal lesions, (2) develop a DeepDES system for diagnosis of detected lesions, and (3) evaluate the clinical benefit of DeepDES system. Successful development of the proposed DeepDES system will provide an advanced decision support that addresses the current concerns about CADe by yielding both high detection sensitivity and high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a target lesion. Broad adoption and use of the DeepDES system will advance the prevention and early diagnosis of cancer, and thus will ultimately reduce mortality from colorectal cancer in the United States.

"Graph-Based Medical Image Segmentation in 3D and 4D DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive continuation of our Phase-II project. After successfully fulfilling all of its aims, our framework for optimal multi-surface andor multi-object n-D biomedical image segmentation was further extended, validated, and its practical utility demonstrated in clinical and translational image analysis tasks. This Phase-III proposal will develop several important extensions addressing identified limitations of the current framework and specifically focusing on applicability of the methodology to translational and routine healthcare tasks. Novel methods will be developed for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions and surfaces, automated design of cost functions from segmentation examples, and overcoming failures of automated techniques in routine diagnostic quality images by allowing limited and highly efficient expert input to guide the image segmentation processes.  We hypothesize that advanced graph-based image segmentation algorithms merging machine- learning-derived segmentation parameters and image-specific expert guidance will significantly increase quantitative analysis performance in routinely acquired complex diagnostic-quality medical images across diverse application areas. We propose to: 1) Develop 3D, 4D, and generally n-D approaches for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions (objects) and surfaces. 2) Develop methods for data-driven automated design of cost functions used for surface-based, region-based, and surface-and-region-based graph search image segmentation. 3) Develop ""Just-Enough-Interaction"" (JEI) approaches for efficient ""real-time"" medical image segmentation, thus achieving robust clinical applicability of quantitative medical image analysis. 4) Assess performance of all developed methods in translational research settings; determine performance in quantitative medical image analysis and radiation oncology treatment planning workflow.

"New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging Project Summary To more fully exploit the basic science of mechanobiology as it pertains to breast cancer progression, the medical imaging field continues to search for fast, safe, and effective elasticity imaging methods. In this project we propose a fundamentally new approach to ultrasonic elasticity imaging in which the weak forces applied to patient tissues and the measured displacements that result are used to train a numerical model specifically for that patient. This constitutive model is developed using finite-element methods and neural networks assembled in a unique configuration called the AutoProgressive (AutoP) Method. AutoP “learns” complete stress and strain properties directly from sparse force and displacement measurements and without a mathematical model. Using quasi-static stimuli, AutoP exploits the fact that each force-displacement estimate contains information about mechanical properties at all locations in the contiguous tissue. From measurement information and conservation laws, AutoP generates an informational model without the need to make assumptions about tissue linearity, isotropy, or other material properties normally required when constructing images that display tissue mechanical properties. Once an accurate material-property model is formed by AutoP, we adopt a separate rheological model (e.g., Kelvin Voigt) to form viscoelastic parameters for image display. The AutoP method employs beamformed RF-echo acquisitions from which point displacements are estimated, applied compressional force sensed at the transducer surface, and tissue shape.  No other imaging method is capable of estimating all relevant stress fields, which gives AutoP unique capabilities. AutoP estimates the mechanical properties that one strives to obtain from an inverse problem approach, but AutoP is not a mathematical inverse technique and hence does not suffer from nonunique solutions. Without the need to assume material properties, AutoP can (in principle) model tissue properties in three dimensions and in time following large deformations in highly-nonlinear, anisotropic media. This R21 proposal focuses on establishing the feasibility of the AutoP methodology for subsequent clinical trials under future funding. At the completion of this two-year project, we will demonstrate a new tool for medical imaging capable of exploring the mechanical properties of tissues over a very broad range of deformations. We specifically target ultrasonic methods and quasi-static force stimuli in this project. However AutoP could eventually be coupled to other imaging modalities (e.g., MRE, OCE) or dynamic force-stimulus methods.  The scientific premise underlying AutoP is that we already record all of the information needed to generate a very broad range of elasticity images. The key to unlocking this information is to set aside mathematical models in favor of data-driven informational models built using the unique machine learning abilities of the AutoP method. If successful, AutoP will have a major influence on medical elasticity imaging methods. Project Narrative: A new type of machine-learning method is proposed for elasticity imaging of patient tissues that offers the potential to minimize many current limitations. If we are successful in this development, ultrasonic elasticity imaging would significantly improve in its ability to accurately represent mechanical properties of breast tissues, without any changes in current instrumentation and without increasing cost to the healthcare system or adding risk to patients.",New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging,9385425,R21EB023402,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Isotropy', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modulus', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonics', 'Writing', 'aged', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'cost', 'experience', 'healthy volunteer', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'imaging properties', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'mechanical properties', 'model building', 'model development', 'novel strategies', 'object shape', 'processing speed', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'viscoelasticity']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2017,220062,-0.0011871205017273865
"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris�n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris�n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,9264531,R01EY023279,"['Acute', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Papilledema', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability burden', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'public health relevance']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2017,339750,0.006006276861475071
"Simultaneous imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism using dynamic 18F-FDG PET ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ischemic cardiomyopathy affects approximately 3 million people in the United States. This form of heart failure is the result of myocardial infarcton or severe coronary heart disease that reduces the viability and function of the heart. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is associated with poor long-term survival when patients with viable myocardium are not revascularized. By imaging myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism and seeking flow-metabolism mismatches, positron emission tomography (PET) method has been established as the gold standard of assessing myocardial viability for selecting patients who can benefit most from surgical revascularization. Current PET method employs two separate static scans with two different radiotracers for generation of the flow-metabolism image pair. While the image of glucose metabolism is acquired using the most widely used radiotracer 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), myocardial blood flow imaging with the radiotracer 13N-ammonia or rubidium-82 suffers from limited clinical availability. In addition, the imaging protoco of two separate imaging sessions is time consuming and resource intensive. As a result, myocardial viability via PET is currently under-utilized in clinic despite its high accuracy and th fast-growing installation of PET/CT scanners in the past decade. In this project, we propose to develop a novel PET method for myocardial viability assessment that only uses a single injection of FDG without the need of a flow- specific radiotracer. We hypothesize that myocardial blood flow can be derived from the quantitative kinetic parameters of dynamic FDG PET. We will develop a new multi-variable prediction model using statistical machine learning to predict myocardial blood flow from dynamic FDG PET data. We will also develop a shortened dynamic FDG PET protocol to improve practicality. This innovation will provide the flow-metabolism image pair for myocardial viability assessment in a clinically favorable time, cost and with reduced radiation dose. Success of this research will make PET assessment of myocardial viability more widely available in clinic with easier access, lower radiation dose, cheaper imaging cost and shorter clinical visit time as compared with conventional two-session protocols, thus improving our clinical practice of treating ischemic cardiomyopathy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a gold standard method for detecting viable myocardium to select which patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy to benefit most from surgical revascularization. Its use in clinic, however, is under-utilized because of the limited clinical availability of the radiotracers needed. This research aims to develop a novel PET imaging method for assessment of myocardial viability that can be easily accessed in clinic with reduced lower radiation dose and imaging cost without compromising imaging performance.",Simultaneous imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism using dynamic 18F-FDG PET,9251317,R21HL131385,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ammonia', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cyclotrons', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Investments', 'Kinetics', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rubidium', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Tracer', 'United States', 'Visit', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose transport', 'heart function', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'ischemic cardiomyopathy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'public health relevance', 'radiotracer', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'success', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2017,195625,0.005554163377189936
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information.

"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.

"Automated Image Guidance for Diagnosing Skin Cancer With Confocal Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Melanoma is diagnosed in approximately 124,000 people and is responsible for about 10,000 deaths every year, in the USA. Dermatologists rely on visual and dermatoscopic examination to discriminate benign melanocytic lesions from malignant, resulting in high and highly variable benign-to-malignant biopsy ratios from 8:1 to 47:1, and millions of unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging has been proven for noninvasively guiding diagnosis of melanoma in several large clinical studies. RCM imaging at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) provides sensitivity of 92-88% and specificity of 71-84%. The specificity is 2 times superior to that of dermatoscopy. RCM imaging at the DEJ is now being implemented to rule out malignancy, reduce biopsy and guide treatment. However, this is currently at only a few sites, where there are highly trained experts who can ensure that imaging is appropriately performed and images are read correctly. These experts are a small international cohort of ""early adopter"" clinicians, who have worked with RCM technology during the past decade and have become highly skilled readers. For novice (non-expert) clinicians in the wider cohort who are keen to adopt RCM, learning to read images is challenging and requires substantial effort and time. Two major technical barriers underlie the dramatic variability in diagnostic accuracy among novice clinicians. Together they limit utility, reproducibility and wider adoption of RCM. The first is user dependent subjective variability in depths near the DEJ at which images are acquired, and the second is variability in interpretation of images. We propose to address these barriers with computational ""multi-faceted"" classification modeling (innovation), image analysis and machine learning algorithms. Our specific aims are: (1) to develop and evaluate algorithms for both dermatoscopic images and RCM depth-stacks, to enable automated standardized and consistent acquisition of RCM mosaics at the DEJ in melanocytic lesions; (2) to develop and evaluate algorithms to discriminate patterns of cellular morphology at the DEJ into two classes, benign lesions versus malignant (dysplastic lesions and melanoma); and (3) to test our algorithms on patients for acquisition of RCM mosaics and classification into those two groups, with statistical validation against pathology, with statistical validation against pathology. Preliminary studies show that our algorithms can delineate the DEJ with accuracy in the range ~3-13 μm in strongly pigmented dark skin and ~5-20 μm in lightly pigmented fair skin, and can detect cellular morphologic patterns with sensitivity in the range 67-80% and specificity 78-99%. Melanocytic lesions can be distinguished from the surrounding normal skin at the DEJ with 80% classification accuracy. We are a team of researchers from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern University and University of Modena. Our success will produce standardized imaging and analysis approaches, to advance RCM for noninvasive detection of melanoma. Furthermore, these approaches can be useful for non-melanoma skin cancers, cutaneous lymphoma and other skin disorders (wider impact). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is an optical imaging technology that can guide biopsy and enable noninvasive screening and diagnosis of skin cancers. However, visual reading and interpretation of RCM images requires substantial training for clinicians.

"Development of An Integrated High Throughput Imaging and Image Analysis Platform for Muscle ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is growing awareness that weakness of muscle is a significant biomedical health issue associated with many different chronic diseases and aging. There are a variety of different diseases that affect muscle, including muscular dystrophy, fibromyalgia, cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and myasthenia gravis, each of which carries its own unique set of symptoms, accompanied by a myriad of genetic and molecular abnormalities. There is agreement within the basic research and clinical communities that important morphological characteristics of muscle fibers, such as fiber cross sectional area, fiber type, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration, and fibrosis are among many critical factors that determine the health and functionality of the muscle. Until now, the imaging equipment available is relatively low throughput and the quantification is still largely based on manual or, at best, semi-automatic methods that require extensive human intervention. In Phase I, CytoInformatics LLC has developed a software called CytoQuant, which can accurately perform automatic segmentation and provide accurate boundaries of each muscle fiber for a cropped image patch. The goal of CytoInformatics LLC in Phase II is to 1) deliver the first version of the CytoQuant software to the market, 2) develop the second version of CytoQuant by continuously improving its performance, especially in handling large scale, whole slide images, and also 3) develop an integrated multiplexing imaging hardware and analysis software framework as a seamless solution for high throughput, automated image analysis of muscle specimens. After careful investigation in Phase I (please refer to the details in business plan), we conclude that this integrated software/hardware platform with cutting-edge technologies in advanced imaging, large scale machine learning, and big data is commercially attractive to the entire muscle community including research institutes, hospitals, and pharmaceutical and athletic companies, demonstrated by strong enthusiasm among end users and many supporting letters. The specific aims are: 1) Deliver the first version of CytoQuant developed in Phase I to the market, continue to develop the second version of CytoQuant, which will focus on improving the robustness and speed in handling whole slide images; 2) Develop an integrated platform that provides unified imaging hardware and image analysis software to handle whole slide images labeled with multiple bio-relevant markers. This unified whole-slide based software and hardware solution will deliver an efficient and specialized imaging platform that seamlessly integrates with a high throughput, multi-marker, and automatic image analysis software specifically designed for muscle. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In Phase II, CytoInformatics is proposing a unified whole-slide multispectral imaging (MSI) system that seamlessly integrates with a high throughput, accurate, and automated software to provide fast and efficient, multiplexed imaging and quantitative muscle image analysis simultaneously. This will be the first integrated hardware/software solution that is specifically designed for muscle.",Development of An Integrated High Throughput Imaging and Image Analysis Platform for Muscle,9355100,R42AG055375,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Area', 'Athletic', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Businesses', 'Cellular Infiltration', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Eosine Yellowish', 'Equipment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Laboratory Research', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Muscle Weakness', 'Muscle function', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Myasthenia Gravis', 'Noise', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Qi', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Software Design', 'Software Framework', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Yang', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'commercialization', 'design', 'experience', 'gigabyte', 'graphical user interface', 'image processing', 'image visualization', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'interest', 'member', 'muscle form', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'technology development', 'user-friendly']",NIA,"CYTOINFORMATICS, LLC",R42,2017,391844,0.048280401907567695
"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,9268035,R01HL122484,"['3D ultrasound', '4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'perfusion imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,770494,0.023958751990153418
"Area B:  Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to Measure Tumor Glutamine and Glucose Metabolic Rates in a Single Imaging Session Precision oncology places an increased demand on cancer diagnostics to characterize tumors at the time of diagnosis. Tissue diagnostics for precision oncology increasingly rely on multi-valent assays to characterize cancer biology and identify therapeutic targets. The power of molecular imaging for cancer diagnosis has been well demonstrated by [18F]fluorodexoyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET/CT), widely used in clinical oncology. PET tracers targeted to facets of tumor biology now enable multi-valent molecular imaging to identify therapeutic targets. Early studies show that combined tracer studies, commonly FDG plus a target- specific tracer, are highly predictive of tumor response to targeted therapy. However, emissions from different PET tracers are indistinguishable to a PET scanner, requiring separate imaging sessions on separate days for multiple 18F-based tracers (~ 2 hour half-life) in the same patient. This limits the clinical practicality of multi-tracer PET, and fails to exploit the full power of multi-tracer PET to quantify tumor in vivo biology and biologic heterogeneity for highly variable process such as cancer metabolism. We will overcome this limitation by taking advantage of recent developments in volumetric PET scanners, fast reconstruction, and 4D image analysis methods from our laboratories to develop Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate multi-valent, quantitative biologic parametric images for two or more tracers in a single session to guide precision oncology and translational cancer biology research. As such, our proposed technology development project addresses a need, described under Priority Area B for “new capabilities for advancing precise clinical diagnosis of cancer patients”. Using methods developed in our laboratories, we now propose to integrate and enhance these methodologies to develop and validate Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate quantitative biologic parametric images for two or more tracers in a single session. We will develop and test this approach for simultaneous glucose and glutamine metabolism imaging, with the goal of guiding metabolism-targeted therapy such as inhibitors of glutaminase (GLS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The project will focus on the technology developments (largely computational) that enable multi-tracer imaging. Ongoing and separately funded work on clinical studies will acquire data from two separate imaging PET sessions using current technology and will provide data for method development. We will first optimize tracer dose timing, image reconstruction, and image time binning for dual tracer MTV-PET (Aim 1), followed by implementation and technical validation of image analysis using a mixture analysis approach (Aim 2). This will set the stage for technical validation of MTV-PET (Aim 3) and an exploratory aim (Aim 4) testing image analytics based on machine learning. Successful completion of our technology development will yield a new method for multi-tracer PET that would change the landscape for cancer imaging diagnostic biomarker and precision oncology research, consistent with goals of RFA-CA-17-023 Priority Area B.

We will advantage of recent developments in volumetric positron emission tomography (PET) scanners, fast reconstruction, and 4D image analysis to develop methods for multi-tracer PET with the goal of generating quantitative, multi-parametric whole-body images of specific aspects of cancer biology, including cancer metabolism as the focus of our proposed technology development projects.

"Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) is a consortium of centers developing quantitative image features, which are proving to be valuable biomarkers of the underlying cancer biology and that can be used for assessing response to treatment and predicting clinical outcome. It is now important to discover the best quantitative imaging features for detection of response to therapeutics, to identify subtypes of cancer, and to correlate with cancer genomics. However, progress is thwarted by the lack of shared software algorithms, architectures, and resources required to compute, compare, evaluate, and disseminate these quantitative imaging features within the QIN and the broader community. We propose to develop the Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline (QIFP), a cloud-based, open source platform that will give researchers free access to these capabilities and hasten the introduction of quantitative image biomarkers into single- and multi-center clinical trials. The QIFP will facilitate assessment of the incremental value of new vs. existing image feature sets. It will also allow researchers to add their own algorithms to compute novel quantitative image features in their own studies and to disseminate them to the greater research community. To accomplish this: (1) We will create an expandable library of quantitative imaging feature algorithms capable of comprehensive characterization of the imaging phenotype of cancer. It will support a broad set of imaging modalities and algorithms implemented in a variety of languages, including algorithms that provide volumetric and time-varying assessment of lesion size, shape, edge sharpness, and pixel statistics. (2) We will build a cloud-based software architecture for creating, executing, and comparing quantitative image feature-generating pipelines, including algorithms in the library and/or those supplied by QIN or other researchers as plug-ins. QIFP will also have (a) a machine learning engine that lets users specify a dependent variable (e.g., progression-free survival) that the quantitative image features can used to predict, and (b) an evaluation engine that compares the utility of particular features for predicting the dependent variable. (3) We will assess the QIFP in four ways: (a) by its ability to recapitulate the role of known biomarkers in a related clinical trial, (b) by comparing linear measurement, metabolic tumor burden and novel combinations of the features in our library for predicting one-year progression-free survival, (c) by merging imaging features with known host-, drug- and tumor-based follicular lymphoma biomarkers in order to develop the most robust and integrative predictive model for patient outcomes, and (d) by using the QIFP to combine and to evaluate image feature algorithms developed by another QIN team and our own NCI- funded team in the study of radiogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer. The QIFP will fill a substantial gap in the science currently being carried out in the QIN and in the community by providing the tools and infrastructure to assess the value of novel quantitative imaging features of cancer, and will thereby accelerate incorporating new imaging biomarkers into single and multi-center clinical trials and into oncology practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop and evaluate a software platform that has major relevance for human health. Many investigators are pursuing image-based surrogates for response to therapy that could be used in clinical trials to predict their success/failure earlier and that are more accurate than existing surrogates. Our developments will facilitate sharing, assessing, and comparing combinations of image feature-generating software algorithms for predicting treatment response, survival, and tissue genomics, which will, in turn, greatly accelerate the development and acceptance of new and more relevant imaging surrogates for assessing cancer treatments.","Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers",9324146,U01CA187947,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Privatization', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Pythons', 'RNA Sequences', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical predictors', 'cloud based', 'disorder subtype', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive of treatment response', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vector', 'web based interface']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,487132,0.003032481285780749
"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,9306838,K23DK101687,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intestinal Fibrosis', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Steroids', 'Surgical Management', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'blood-based biomarker', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'glycoproteomics', 'improved', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'learning strategy', 'lecturer', 'matriculation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool development', 'translational impact', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2017,194400,0.0023885731676756726
"Software for OCT Analysis of Vascular Stents Software for OCT Analysis of Vascular Stents PI: Ronny Shalev, PhD, Dyad Medical Summary Dyad Medical, Inc. will create intravascular OCT (IVOCT) software for clinical, live time determination of stent apposition (OCTivat-live, the live time OCT image visualization and analysis tool) and for offline analysis of stent implantation (OCTivat-stent). Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intra- vascular stents creating an opportunity for both solutions. Although advancements such as drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent design parameters include drug, material (bioresorbable vs metal), polymer composition, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To opti- mize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical evaluations. Intravascular OCT (IVOCT) is the lone imaging modality with the resolution and contrast to meet this challenge. The Core Lab at CWRU is the premiere site in the world for manual analysis of IVOCT image data. A cardiologist analyst takes 6-16 hrs to analyze manually a single stent, and despite training and quality assurance measures, inter- analyst variability can limit the power to determine changes between stent designs. Building upon work at CWRU, we will develop advanced, highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibil- ity, increase accuracy, and harmonize analysis. Software will reduce costs by decreasing manual labor, and with improved reproducibility, possibly enable the use of historical data, eliminating cost of a control arm. Re- garding live time analysis, rather than manually reviewing >500 images in a pullback, with fast software, it will be possible to present the number and location of malapposed struts in 3D, providing instant feedback to phy- sicians on the need for additional dilatation with a larger balloon or higher pressure. In addition, we will auto- matically determine stent and vessel area along the length of the pullback, allowing us to compute stent ex- pansion and eccentricity, quantitative measures related to successful stent deployment, the most important de- terminant of outcome. IVOCT could also play a role at patient follow up. If a stent is well covered, then long- term anti-platelet therapy might be unnecessary, minimizing bleeding risk.

"Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Image evaluation of skeletal muscle biopsies is a procedure essential to research and clinical practice. Although widely used, several major limitations exist with respect to current muscle image morphometric measurement, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, retrieval, and mining procedures: 1) Although traditional morphometric parameters, such as cross-sectional area (CSA) and minimum Feret diameter, etc., serve as critical indicators for assessing muscle function, current measurements are still largely based on manual or semi-automated methods, leading to significant labor costs with large potential inter-observer variability. 2) The current archiving of muscle images is still mainy based on outdated tools such as Excel spreadsheets and computer file folders. Given a new muscle image, it is almost impossible to quickly cross-compare, visualize, query, search, and retrieve previous cases exhibiting similar image contents with comparable morphometric measures, for the purpose of either discovering novel biological co-correlations at benchside, or providing personalized diagnosis and prognosis at bedside. 3) Although a typical muscle image often contains millions of data points (pixels), in clinical practice, doctors often condense this rich information into one or two diagnostic labels and discard the rest. Novel image markers, which are not always apparent through visual inspections or not manually quantifiable, but potentially represent critical diagnostic and prognostic values for precision medicine, have not been rigorously examined. Similarly, in basic science research, only a very limited number of known measures (e.g., CSA) are considered. Some non-traditional measures, such as myofiber shapes that hold the potential to serve as new indicators of muscle functions, are not fully investigated. 4) Current muscle image analysis and searching functions are fairly low throughput. As a frontier research area, Cloud computing can handle big image data in a distributed manner by providing high-throughput computational power. However, its application to muscle images has never been explored. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, bioinformatics image mining, and Cloud computing. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Develop the automated morphometric measurement unit, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) unit, and the image archiving and visualization unit. 2) Develop the advanced bioinformatics image mining unit to assist in the rapid discovery and validation of new image markers. 3) Develop the Cloud computing unit to enable big image data processing and searching functions. Disseminate this freely available, Cloud-enabled imaging informatics system to muscle research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to develop and disseminate an advanced Cloud-enabled imaging informatics tool - MuscleMiner. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, and bioinformatics image mining. The goal of MuscleMiner is to offer a freely available and powerful tool to help all clinician and basic scienc muscle researchers in their daily work. Beyond fast, objective, reproducible, and automated morphometric measurements, the impact of MuscleMiner will be multiplied by laboratories using the CBIR and visualization units (Aim 1), bioinformatics image mining unit (Aim 2), and Cloud-computing unit (Aim 3) to deeply mine and fully utilize the rich information embedded in large collections of muscle images.",Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus,9316507,R01AR065479,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Exhibits', 'Fascicle', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Pathologic', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Shapes', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Slide', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'frontier', 'image archival system', 'image visualization', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'personalized diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic value', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'wasting']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2017,379732,0.05034654207944446
"Retinal connectome: mobile game and crowdsourcing algorithms for EyeWire II ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An online community called EyeWire proved that volunteers can be motivated to reconstruct neural circuits through an activity resembling a 3D coloring book. EyeWire helped discover space-time speciﬁcity of the wiring from bipolar cells to starburst amacrine cells, which suggested a surprising new model for direction selectivity in the retina. Motivated by this success, we are preparing to launch EyeWire II, which aims to map the entire retinal connectome, yielding the ﬁrst complete wiring diagram for any region of the mammalian CNS. This ambitious goal will require innovative advances in virtually every component of EyeWire. The underlying electron microscopic image of the retina will be replaced by a new image with increased size and quality. A new artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) will be trained using a new software package for 3D deep learning. While the improved AI is expected to reduce the amount of human effort required to reconstruct a neuron, the number of neurons targeted for reconstruction will also increase dramatically. Overall, the absolute amount of human effort required will increase rather than decrease. Therefore it is critical to improve EyeWire's crowdsourcing to (1) mobilize more human effort and (2) to use human effort more efﬁciently. This project aims to radically improve both aspects, thereby making the retinal connectome achievable by EyeWire II. In Aim 1, we will create a compelling mobile game with the target of engaging 10x more people than the existing EyeWire community. In Aim 2, we will develop and deploy new crowdsourcing algorithms that extract wisdom from the crowd by weighted voting and optimally assign players to tasks. The Aims will be achieved through collaboration between three organizations. Wired Differently, Inc. (WD) is a new Boston-based nonproﬁt organization dedicated to ""citizen neuroscience"" that was recently spun out of MIT. WD currently operates EyeWire in collaboration with the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. The Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) at Carnegie Mellon University will offer a project-based class to its master's students to design and prototype new ideas for the mobile game. Both Aims will produce code and algorithms that will be made publicly available, and could have broad impact on citizen science. As the ﬁrst crowdsourcing of 3D image analysis, the code produced by Aim 1 could be useful for the many other kinds of 3D images found in biomedical research. The crowdsourcing algorithms of Aim 2 are potentially useful for any citizen science project facing the challenge of obtaining accurate and reliable results from a heterogeneous group of volunteers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeWire II will increase public understanding of the structure of the nervous system. The retinal connectome could aid those attempting to develop blindness therapies based on regenerating cells and their wiring. It could also aid the development of retinal prosthetics that directly stimulate ganglion cells and computationally emulate the bypassed micro circuitry. 1",Retinal connectome: mobile game and crowdsourcing algorithms for EyeWire II,9330810,UH2CA203710,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blindness', 'Books', 'Boston', 'Breathing', 'Bypass', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electrons', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Love', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'New York', 'Nonprofit Organizations', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Social Interaction', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Territoriality', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Volunteer Group', 'Voting', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'citizen science', 'connectome', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'fine art', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'innovation', 'microscopic imaging', 'neural circuit', 'online community', 'pleasure', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'retinal prosthesis', 'simulation', 'starburst amacrine cell', 'success', 'university student', 'virtual', 'visual neuroscience', 'volunteer']",NCI,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,UH2,2017,320900,-0.009872461015488696
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,9300962,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging study', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2017,169609,0.008414334554756042
"Digital Pathology_Accuracy Viewing Behavior and Image Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 1.4 million women per year depend on pathologists to accurately interpret breast biopsies for a diagnosis of benign disease or cancer. Diagnostic errors are alarmingly frequent and likely lead to altered patient treatment, especially at the thresholds of atypical hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ, where up to 50% of cases are misclassified. The causes underlying these errors remain largely unknown.  Technology similar to Google Maps now allows pan and zoom manipulation of high-resolution digital images of glass microscope slides. This technology has virtually replaced the microscope in medical schools and is rapidly diffusing into U.S. pathology practices. No research has evaluated the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists' interpretion of digital images vs. glass slides. However, these ""digital slides"" offer a novel opportunity to study the accuracy, efficiency, and viewing behavior of a large number of pathologists as they manipulate and interpret images. The innovative analytic techniques proposed in this application are similar to those used to improve the performance of pilots and air traffic controllers. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Digital Image vs. Glass Slides: To compare the interpretive accuracy of pathologists viewing digitized slide images over the Internet to their performance viewing original glass slides under a microscope. A randomized national sample of pathologists (N=200) will interpret 240 test cases in one or both formats in two phases. Measures will include a diagnostic assessment for each test case and for digital slides, cursor- (i.e., mouse) tracking data and region of interest (ROI) markings. Completion of this aim will establish benchmarks for the comparative diagnostic accuracy of whole-slide digital images.  Aim 2. Interpretive Screening Behavior: To identify visual scanning patterns associated with diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Detailed simultaneous eye-tracking and cursor-tracking data will be collected on 60 additional pathologists while they interpret digital slides to complement data from Aim 1. Viewing patterns will be analyzed from computer representations of raw movement data. Videos depicting accurate, efficient visual scanning and cursor movement will be valuable tools in educating the next generation of digital pathologists. Aim 3. Image Analyses: To examine and classify the image characteristics (including color, texture, and structure) of ROIs captured in Aims 1 and 2. Computer-based statistical learning techniques will be used to identify image characteristics that lead to correct and incorrect diagnoses. Characteristics of both diagnostic and distracting ROIs will be identified, linking all three aims. In summary, we will determine whether digitized whole-slide images are diagnostically equivalent to original glass slides. Our in-depth scientific evaluation of viewing patterns and characteristics of ROIs identified by pathologists will be critical to understanding diagnostic errors and sources of distraction. Optimization of viewing techniques will improve diagnostic performance and thus, the quality of clinical care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pathologist errors in the interpretation of biopsy specimens can result in significant harm to patients. Digital imaging technology is rapidly diffusing into medical settings, providing a unique opportunity to obtain data on the process used by pathologists when interpreting slides. The results will provide the foundation needed to improve interpretive accuracy and efficiency, support quality improvement efforts, and ultimately reduce the burden of misdiagnosis on patients and the health care delivery system.",Digital Pathology_Accuracy Viewing Behavior and Image Characterization,9194390,R01CA172343,"['Adoption', 'Air', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Atypical hyperplasia', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Breast biopsy', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Error Sources', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Errors', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rural Hospitals', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientific Evaluation', 'Slide', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative', 'computer monitor', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital media', 'distraction', 'eye hand coordination', 'health care delivery', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'migration', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pedagogy', 'public health relevance', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,611703,0.011917332823263113
"Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease by imaging the left ventricle (LV) of the heart at rest and then after either exercise or pharmacologically-induce stress to reveal ischemia. However, acquisitions are heavily operator dependent, two-dimensional (2D), and interpretation is generally based on qualitative assessment. While a variety of quantitative 2D approaches have been proposed in the research literature, none have been shown to be superior to the still highly variable qualitative visual comparison of rest/stress echocardiographic image sequences for detecting ischemic disease. Here, we propose that the way forward must focus on a new computational image analysis paradigm for quantitative 4D (three spatial dimensions plus time) stress echocardiography. Our strategy integrates information derived from both radiofrequency (RF) and B-mode echocardiographic images acquired using a matrix array probe. The integrated analysis system will yield accurate and robust measures of strain and strain rate - at rest, stress and differentially between rest and stress - that will identify myocardial tissue at-risk after dobutamine-induced stress. This work wil involve the development of novel (1) phase-sensitive, correlation-based RF ultrasound speckle tracking to estimate mid-wall displacements, (2) ma- chine learning techniques to localize the LV bounding surfaces and their displacements from B-mode data, (3) a meshless integration approach based on radial basis functions (RBFs) and Bayesian reasoning/sparse coding to estimate dense spatiotemporal parameters of strain and strain rate and (4) non-rigid registration of rest and stress image sequences to develop unique, 3D differential deformation parameters. The quantitative approach will be validated with implanted sonomicrometers and microsphere-derived flows using an acute canine model of stenosis. The ability of deformation and differential deformation derived from 4D stress echocardiography to detect new myocardial tissue at-risk in the presence of existing infarction will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic canine model of infarction with superimposed ischemia. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility of our deformation and differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Three main collaborators will team on this work. A group led by Matthew O'Donnell from the University of Washington will develop the RF-based speckle tracking methods. An image analysis group led by the PI James Duncan at Yale University will develop methods for segmentation, shape tracking, dense displacement integration and strain computation. A cardiology/physiology group under Dr. Albert Sinusas at Yale will perform the acute and chronic canine studies and the human stress echo studies. A consultant from Philips Medical Systems will work with the entire team to bridge the ultrasound image acquisition technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The detection and diagnosis of coronary artery disease are commonly performed using stress echocardiography, a test that is performed 3 million times in the United States annually. Our new methods will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation in 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) due to stress using a cost efficient and noninvasive imaging technology. The resulting methodology may lead to more sensitive and accurate detection of stress-induced ischemia that will better guide clinical decision making.",Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography,9212187,R01HL121226,"['Acute', 'Anatomy', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomechanics', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiology', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diastole', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dobutamine', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Exercise', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Heart Ventricle', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Implant', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Radial', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stenosis', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Ventricular', 'Visual', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'elastography', 'in vivo', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'perfusion imaging', 'public health relevance', 'radio frequency', 'radiofrequency', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,768639,0.025305969559448933
"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional DESCRIPTION: Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences.

"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management.

"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management.

"Deep radiomic colon cleansing for laxative-free CT colonography Project Summary/Abstract Colon cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, can be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC), also known as virtual colonoscopy, could substantially increase the capacity, safety, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. However, an FDA panel has recently identified two remaining concerns about CTC: patient adherence, and the detection of small polyps and flat lesions. Our clinical multi-center trial showed that laxative-free preparation by oral ingestion of a contrast agent (iodine) to indicate fecal materials for electronic cleansing (EC), followed by computer-aided detection (CADe), makes CTC easy to tolerate for patients while enabling the detection of ≥10 mm lesions at sensitivity comparable to that of optical colonoscopy. However, small polyps and flat lesions were a significant source of false negatives, because EC produced image artifacts that imitated such lesions. Because laxative-free CTC addresses the concern of patient adherence, the only remaining concern about CTC is the detection of small polyps and flat lesions. The goal of this project is to develop a novel multi-material deep-learning scheme, hereafter denoted as Deep- ECAD, that integrates EC and CADe for the detection of small polyps and flat lesions in laxative-free spectral CTC (spCTC), where spectral imaging and deep learning will be used to overcome the above limitations of conventional CTC. Our specific aims are to (1) establish a laxative-free ultra-low-dose spCTC image database, (2) develop a multi-material deep-learning method for EC, (3) develop deep radiomic detection of small polyps and flat lesions, and (4) evaluate the clinical benefit of Deep-ECAD with laxative-free cases. Successful development of the proposed Deep-ECAD scheme will substantially improve human readers’ performance in the detection of small polyps and flat lesions while minimizing the inconveniences of bowel preparation and radiation risk to patients. Such a scheme will make laxative-free spCTC a highly accurate and acceptable screening option for large populations, in particular, Medicare population, leading to an increased screening rate, promoting early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reducing mortality due to colon cancer. Project Narrative Successful development of the proposed deep-learning EC-CADe scheme for detecting small polyps and flat lesions in ultra-low-dose laxative-free spCTC (Deep-ECAD) will substantially improve reader performance in the detection of small polyps and flat lesions while minimizing the inconveniences of bowel preparation and radiation risk to patients.

"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue identification and quantification plays a significant role in the study of aging and age-related diseases. For example, the accumulation of fat in the human body and its regional distribution with aging is associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in muscle composition are strongly linked to decline of muscle strength, decreased mobility caused by aging, or musculoskeletal disorders. Especially interesting is analysis of longitudinal changes of morphometric descriptors that is significant for studying the aging process and for the diagnosis and prevention of age-related diseases.  Medical imaging has emerged as a major tool for estimation of body composition mainly due to being non- invasive and producing multi-dimensional information. Nowadays MRI and CT acquisition is a central component of clinical trials. An abundance of imaging data is collected, but this wealth of information has not been utilized to full extent. Therefore research on image analysis techniques for tissue quantification that are reproducible and can be used on large-scale clinical trials is of particular importance.  The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse body composition data from modern MRI and CT imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who are healthy versus those who are not. The goal of our work is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the abdomen and lower extremities and to study the relationship between body morphological changes and age-related pathologies.  We will build upon recent advances in medical image computing to segment muscle, regional adipose tissue, and bone in clinical CT and MRI scans. We will also develop image registration procedures to achieve intra- and inter-subject correspondence and make efficient use of information provided by multi-modal and multi-temporal imaging data collected in clinical trials (aim 1). After these methods have been developed, we will address the hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging can increase the prognostic accuracy of age-related pathologies (aim2). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic and affect the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million don't know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function. This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition and its changes with increasing age to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES,9244841,SC3GM113754,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delaware', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Techniques', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age related', 'biophysical model', 'bone', 'clinical imaging', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'statistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY,SC3,2017,63883,0.012645454976479205

"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,9350173,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multi-atlas segmentation', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,597688,0.04660511158591561
"Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the advent of whole slide digital scanners, histopathology slides can be digitized into very high-resolution digital images, realizing a new ""big data"" stream that can potentially rival ""omics data"" in size and complexity. Just as with the analysis of high-throughput genetic and expression data, the application of sophisticated image analytic tools and data pipelines can render the often passive data of digital pathology (DP) archives into a powerful source for: (a) rich quantitative insights into cancer biology and (b) companion diagnostic decision support tools for precision medicine. Digital pathology enabled companion diagnostic tests could yield predictions of cancer risk and aggressiveness in a manner similar to molecular diagnostic tests. However, prior to widespread clinical adoption of DP, extensive evaluation of clinical interpretation of DP imaging (DPI) and accompanying decision support tools needs to be undertaken. Wider acceptance of DPI by the cancer community (clinical and research) is hampered by lack of a publicly available, open access image informatics platform for easily viewing, managing, and quantitatively analyzing DPIs. While some commercial platforms exist for viewing and analyzing DPI data, none of these platforms are freely available. Open source image viewing/management platforms that cater to the radiology (e.g. XNAT) and computational biology communities are typically not conducive to handling very large file sizes as encountered with DPI datasets.  This multi-PI U24 proposal seeks to expand on an existing, freely available pathology image viewer (Sedeen Image Viewer) to create a pathology informatics platform (PIIP) for managing, annotating, sharing, and quantitatively analyzing DPI data. Sedeen was designed as a universal platform for DPI (by addressing several proprietary scanner formats and ""big data"" challenges), to provide (1) reliable and useful image annotation tools, and (2) for image registration and analysis of DPI data. Additionally, Sedeen has become an application for cropping large DPIs so that they can be input into programs such as Matlab or ImageJ. Sedeen has been freely available to the public for three years, with over 160 unique users from over 20 countries.  Building on the initial successes of Sedeen and its existing user base, our intent is to massively increase dissemination of DPI and algorithms in the cancer research community and clinical trial efforts, as well as to contribute towards the adoption of a rational and standardized set of DP operational conventions. This unique project will allow end users with different needs and technical backgrounds to seamlessly (a) archive and manage, (b) share, and (c) visualize their DPI data, acquired from different sites, formats, and platforms. The PIIP will provide a unified user interface for third party algorithms (nuclear segmentation, color normalization, biomarker quantification, radiology-pathology fusion) and will allow for algorithmic evaluation upon data arising from a plurality of source sites. By partnering with professional societies, we envision that the PIIP user base will expand to include the oncology, pathology, radiology, and pharmaceutical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will result in the further development of advanced functionality of the already existing digital pathology image informatics platform (PIIP) with an established user-base for cancer research. Such an enhanced platform will provide the much-needed foundation for advancing (a) routine clinical adoption of digital pathology for primary diagnosis and (b) training and validation of companion diagnostic decision support systems based off histopathology. Thus, the project is aligned with the NCI's goal to foster innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving human health.","Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management",9341177,U24CA199374,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Community Trial', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Felis catus', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Language', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Students', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'annotation  system', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research site', 'companion diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput analysis', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'open source', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'repository', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user friendly software', 'validation studies']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U24,2017,579791,0.021255942993133114
"Improving Melanoma Pathology Accuracy through Computer Vision Techniques - the IMPACT Study ABSTRACT  This proposal will help to improve the accuracy of diagnosing melanoma and melanocytic lesions. The incidence of melanoma is rising faster than any other cancer, and ~1 in 50 U.S. adults will be diagnosed with melanoma this year alone. Our research team has noted substantial diagnostic errors in interpreting skin biopsies of melanocytic lesions; pathologists disagree in up to 60% of cases of invasive melanoma, which can lead to substantial patient harm. Our proposal uses computer technology to analyze whole-slide digital images of glass slides in order to improve the diagnosis of melanocytic lesions. Using data from an ongoing NIH study, we will digitize and study a set of 240 skin biopsy cases that includes a full spectrum of benign to invasive melanoma diagnoses. Each biopsy case has a reference consensus diagnosis developed by a panel of three international experts in dermatopathology and new data will be available from 160 practicing U.S. community pathologists, providing a uniquely rich clinical database that is the largest of its kind. This project will include novel computational techniques, including the detection of both cellular-level and architectural entities, and the use of a combination of feature-based and deep neural network classifiers. Our specific aims are: 1. To detect cellular-level entities in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions. 2. To detect structural (architectural) entities in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions. 3. To develop an automated diagnosis system that can classify digitized slide images into one of five possible diagnostic classes: benign; atypical lesions; melanoma in situ; invasive melanoma stage T1a; and invasive melanoma stage ≥T1b. In our proposed study, we are innovatively using computer image analysis algorithms and machine learning. This technology has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of pathologists by providing an analytical, undeviating review to assist humans in this difficult task. Project Narrative Diagnosis of melanoma and melanocytic skin biopsy lesions is among the most challenging areas of pathology and our preliminary data shows concerning levels of errors among pathologists. Our ultimate goal is to use innovative computer image analysis and machine learning techniques to reduce diagnostic errors and save patients' lives.

"Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by loss of bone mass and structural deterioration leading to increased risk of fracture. Currently, osteoporosis is diagnosed by measurement of areal bone mineral density by dual- energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, the majority of fractures occur in both women and men who are not classified as osteoporotic by current DXA criteria (T-score = -2.5). As a 2-dimensional (2D) technology, DXA does not provide information about 3-dimensional (3D) bone structure, shape and geometry, which substantially contribute to bone strength and resistance to fracture. Finite element (FE) analysis of quantitative computed tomography (QCT) images can provide 3D structure and strength measurements but QCT is impractical for widespread clinical use because of high radiation exposure and expense. In contrast, DXA is widely available, inexpensive and has low radiation exposure. What is needed is a method by which DXA images can be used to generate 3D shape models that incorporate bone structure and geometry. However, fractures are complex events influenced by other factors including age, race, body mass index, risk of falls, and prior medical and fracture history. Even sophisticated measurements of bone density, structure, and strength may not be able to predict fractures accurately. Machine learning is an emerging field in which models are created by ""learning"" from previous data. These models can incorporate various factors and be used to classify or predict outcomes for new data. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced analyses of widely available DXA images that incorporate structural and strength information and statistical modeling using machine learning to incorporate additional risk factors will better identify patient at high risk of osteoporotic fracture. This hypothesis will be tested using QCT and DXA data from previous studies to generate 3D statistical shape models that describe variability in proximal femur morphology. By aligning 2D DXA images to the models, patient-specific 3D models will be reconstructed for quantitative analyses and combined with FE analysis to estimate bone strength. Machine learning models will be used to incorporate these novel measurements, demographics, and various risk factors for fracture to predict incident fractures in two very large, prospective studies. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to increase the diagnostic utility of DXA, a safe, non-invasive, and widely available technology, by applying novel image processing and statistical techniques to predict fractures more accurately. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 50% of women and 25% of men over age 50 are destined to suffer an osteoporotic fracture during their remaining lifetime. Unfortunately, the current standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, DXA, does not predict most fractures.

"Automated Retinal Analysis for Detection of Age Related Macular Degeneration ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study focuses on age-related macular degeneration (AMD) because, left untreated, it is the leading cause of blindness in the adult US population over 50. The goals of this program are twofold. First, the focus is to develop new screening tools to detect individuals with the intermediate stage of AMD, that are otherwise asymptomatic for vision loss, at a stage where they can be referred to a clinician for treatment and follow up, and when vision more likely can be preserved. The second goal is to develop Automated Retinal Image Analysis (ARIA) tools that help characterize Geographic Atrophy (GA), for which novel treatments are being investigated. We are developing data-driven algorithms for AMD screening which leverage recent advances in machine learning and machine intelligence and do not rely on detecting and counting or sizing drusen (a procedure which can be error prone). Instead, our method analyzes a fundus image as a whole using an image classification paradigm, and may also exploit ancillary patient information. Our goal is to use the AREDS dbGaP that includes thousands of images from hundreds of patients and offers a unique opportunity to develop and test these algorithms on a scale that has not previously been possible. Our team consists of the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute, which will serve as the clinical analysis test site, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, which will conduct the automated screening software tool analysis, development and testing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are twofold. First, in order to work towards improving outcome, our goal is to develop novel software screening tools that allow for the automated detection of individuals with the intermediate stage AMD so that they may be referred to clinicians for follow up and treatment at an earlier stage than would otherwise occur. Second, we will develop new tools to characterize the evolution of GA, for which new treatments are being developed and tested. Our project is a secondary study on the AREDS dbGaP, which will be leveraged for the development and validation of these new algorithms on a scale never before attempted.",Automated Retinal Analysis for Detection of Age Related Macular Degeneration,8998947,R21EY024310,"['Adult', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biotechnology', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Cataract', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Discipline', 'Drusen', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myopia', 'National Eye Institute', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Pigmentation physiologic function', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'age related', 'bioimaging', 'computer program', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'geographic atrophy', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'neovascular', 'novel', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'tool']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,180061,-0.011876240283728554
"Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopes to image cells or other biological samples. Even for small-scale experiments, the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex, and automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye.  We will continue our development of CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org) to meet this strong and growing demand for software to analyze biological images. CellProfiler is a versatile, open-source toolbox. Using its point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized workflow of image-analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. It can extract valuable biological information from images quickly, even for high-throughput experiments, while increasing objectivity and statistical power in microscopy experiments.  Published only seven years ago, CellProfiler is already an important and widely used tool: it is launched 100,000+ times per year by users around the world and has been cited in more than 800 papers from 600 distinct laboratories. The software evolves in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  We propose to improve CellProfiler's capabilities in order to enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler:  First, microscopy experiments are rapidly expanding in both scale and scope, and are beginning to push CellProfiler's limits, particularly when they involve larger images (e.g., for tissue samples, cellular microarrays, large field-of-view cameras), multi-dimensional images (time-lapse and three-dimensional imaging), images for morphological profiling, and novel microscopy types (super-resolution and single-molecule imaging). We will upgrade CellProfiler's capabilities to serve these needs and add proven, state-of-the-art algorithms for image processing (especially segmentation and filtering for non-fluorescence images), time-lapse and 3D analysis, and novel microscopy types. We will also add features and usability improvements requested by the large CellProfiler community.  Second, we will enable researchers to create sophisticated bioimaging analysis workflows by expanding CellProfiler's interoperability with complementary software (e.g., MATLAB, ImageJ, MicroManager, KNIME).  Third, we will disseminate CellProfiler and provide user, educator, and developer support. There is great demand for our online forum, downloadable materials, and in-person tutorials (1,000+ attendees so far).  These improvements to the first, and still preeminent, open-source software for modular, high- throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from microscopy images across all disciplines within biology.

"Ultra-miniaturized single fiber probe for functional brain imaging in freely moving animals ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microscope techniques to image inside brain tissue are generally limited by poor depth penetration. Micro-endoscopy, wherein a probe is physically inserted into the tissue, can overcome this limitation in depth penetration, but at the expense of invasiveness and tissue damage due to the size of the probe. Our goal here is to palliate these problems by developing an ultra-miniature microendoscope probe based on a single, lensless optical fiber.  The direct transmission of an image through an optical ﬁber is diﬃcult because spatial information becomes scrambled upon propagation. We have recently demonstrated an image transmission strategy where spatial information is ﬁrst converted to spectral information. Our strategy is based on a principle of spread-spectrum encoding, borrowed from wireless communications, wherein object pixels are converted into distinct spectral codes that span the full bandwidth of the object spectrum. Image recovery is performed by numerical inversion of the detected spectrum at the ﬁber output. We have provided a simple demonstration of spread-spectrum encoding using macroscopic Fabry-Perot etalons. Our technique enables the 2D imaging of luminous (i.e. fluorescent or bioluminescent) objects with high throughput independent of pixel number. Moreover, it is insensitive to ﬁber bending, contains no moving parts, and opens the attractive possibility of extreme miniaturization down to the size of a single optical fiber.  Our goal here is to develop, characterize, and establish the versatility of a new class of ultra-miniature fiber probes that can provide functional 2D brain imaging at arbitrary depths and with minimal tissue damage. Our strategy will involve probe development, machine-learning algorithm development, and the actual demonstration of microendoscopic imaging in freely moving behaving animals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have recently demonstrated a strategy to image through a single, lensless optical fiber.

"Graph-Based Medical Image Segmentation in 3D and 4D DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive continuation of our Phase-II project. After successfully fulfilling all of its aims, our framework for optimal multi-surface andor multi-object n-D biomedical image segmentation was further extended, validated, and its practical utility demonstrated in clinical and translational image analysis tasks. This Phase-III proposal will develop several important extensions addressing identified limitations of the current framework and specifically focusing on applicability of the methodology to translational and routine healthcare tasks. Novel methods will be developed for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions and surfaces, automated design of cost functions from segmentation examples, and overcoming failures of automated techniques in routine diagnostic quality images by allowing limited and highly efficient expert input to guide the image segmentation processes.  We hypothesize that advanced graph-based image segmentation algorithms merging machine- learning-derived segmentation parameters and image-specific expert guidance will significantly increase quantitative analysis performance in routinely acquired complex diagnostic-quality medical images across diverse application areas. We propose to: 1) Develop 3D, 4D, and generally n-D approaches for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions (objects) and surfaces. 2) Develop methods for data-driven automated design of cost functions used for surface-based, region-based, and surface-and-region-based graph search image segmentation. 3) Develop ""Just-Enough-Interaction"" (JEI) approaches for efficient ""real-time"" medical image segmentation, thus achieving robust clinical applicability of quantitative medical image analysis. 4) Assess performance of all developed methods in translational research settings; determine performance in quantitative medical image analysis and radiation oncology treatment planning workflow. As a result, our project will enable routine quantification and therefore personalized care.

"Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quest for fast image acquisition speed has always been a perennial topic in the MRI community. To reduce the acquisition time for maximal spatial and temporal resolution, modern MRI protocols usually perform reduced acquisitions below the Nyquist rate. The reduced data is then used to reconstruct the image through advanced reconstruction techniques that leverage some prior information about the MRI system (e.g., parallel imaging) and/or MR signal (e.g., compressed sensing). Since such prior information is patient and system specific, recent techniques obtain the prior information using training data obtained through an empirical calibration procedure. All existing methods assume the prior models are linear. Since the intrinsic nonlinear relationship in the training data cannot be characterized in such simple models, the reconstruction is degraded by the inaccuracy of the prior information. Nonlinear learning from the training data have proven to be more powerful in machine learning because it is more general and includes the linear model as a special case. However, it is usually more challenging to learn the nonlinear models and even more challenging to incorporate the model in reconstruction due to the increased degree of freedom. We recently have introduced a novel concept of ""kernel"" in MR reconstruction to address the above challenges timely. Our preliminary results on parallel imaging and sparsity-constrained reconstruction demonstrate that the kernel-based algorithms improve the reconstruction quality over the original algorithms with linear prior models. Built upon our strong preliminary results, the objective of this application is to develop an innovative kernel-based framework for MR image reconstruction from undersampled data. This framework does not require explicit knowledge of nonlinear mapping (as in preliminary work) such that a broader family of nonlinear functions can be explored for different clinical applications. The proposed work is expected to advance the field of MR image reconstruction vertically. Specifically, the successful completion of the proposed project will result in a general framework leading to many new algorithms (including two developed in this project) for reconstruction from reduced acquisition. Therefore, virtually all of current clinical MRI could benefit from the improved resolution, image quality, and/or reduced acquisition times that the new framework will facilitate or the novel applications i may enable. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is to develop a general framework and two specific new techniques to improve the spatial resolution and/or reduce the scan time in magnetic resonance imaging and evaluate the performance of the techniques for 3D parallel imaging and quantitative imaging in brain. The development of such novel fast imaging techniques may greatly enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. Therefore the project will potentially benefit numerous subjects and the healthcare system.",Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling,9119020,R21EB020861,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Family', 'Freedom', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Polynomial Models', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2016,222652,0.03011953007360069
"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale. Clinical applications include the quantification of angiogenesis in tumors and tissue implants, and the quantification of neurovascular effects in neurodegenerative disease models.",Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular,9117645,R00LM011390,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'memory process', 'model building', 'mouse model', 'neuronal cell body', 'neurovascular', 'next generation', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'tumor growth']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R00,2016,244245,0.005405690148939243
"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling.

"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning.

"Simultaneous imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism using dynamic 18F-FDG PET ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ischemic cardiomyopathy affects approximately 3 million people in the United States. This form of heart failure is the result of myocardial infarcton or severe coronary heart disease that reduces the viability and function of the heart. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is associated with poor long-term survival when patients with viable myocardium are not revascularized. By imaging myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism and seeking flow-metabolism mismatches, positron emission tomography (PET) method has been established as the gold standard of assessing myocardial viability for selecting patients who can benefit most from surgical revascularization. Current PET method employs two separate static scans with two different radiotracers for generation of the flow-metabolism image pair. While the image of glucose metabolism is acquired using the most widely used radiotracer 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), myocardial blood flow imaging with the radiotracer 13N-ammonia or rubidium-82 suffers from limited clinical availability. In addition, the imaging protoco of two separate imaging sessions is time consuming and resource intensive. As a result, myocardial viability via PET is currently under-utilized in clinic despite its high accuracy and th fast-growing installation of PET/CT scanners in the past decade. In this project, we propose to develop a novel PET method for myocardial viability assessment that only uses a single injection of FDG without the need of a flow- specific radiotracer. We hypothesize that myocardial blood flow can be derived from the quantitative kinetic parameters of dynamic FDG PET. We will develop a new multi-variable prediction model using statistical machine learning to predict myocardial blood flow from dynamic FDG PET data. We will also develop a shortened dynamic FDG PET protocol to improve practicality. This innovation will provide the flow-metabolism image pair for myocardial viability assessment in a clinically favorable time, cost and with reduced radiation dose. Success of this research will make PET assessment of myocardial viability more widely available in clinic with easier access, lower radiation dose, cheaper imaging cost and shorter clinical visit time as compared with conventional two-session protocols, thus improving our clinical practice of treating ischemic cardiomyopathy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a gold standard method for detecting viable myocardium to select which patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy to benefit most from surgical revascularization. Its use in clinic, however, is under-utilized because of the limited clinical availability of the radiotracers needed. This research aims to develop a novel PET imaging method for assessment of myocardial viability that can be easily accessed in clinic with reduced lower radiation dose and imaging cost without compromising imaging performance.              ",Simultaneous imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism using dynamic 18F-FDG PET,9020059,R21HL131385,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ammonia', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cyclotrons', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Investments', 'Kinetics', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rubidium', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'United States', 'Visit', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose transport', 'heart function', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'ischemic cardiomyopathy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'radiotracer', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'success', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2016,234875,0.005554163377189936
"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care. Our goal is to integrate, enhance, and disseminate three cutting edge ultrasound acquisition, analysis, and display toolkits to create a new framework called Slicer+PLUS that will serve as a catalyst for research and product development into low-cost point-of-care ultrasound applications. In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9176982,R01EB021396,"['Abdomen', 'Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Shapes', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'aging population', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'elastography', 'emergency service responder', 'hospital patient care', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'point of care', 'product development', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'scoliosis', 'signal processing', 'software development', 'transmission process']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2016,677628,0.023210693832778444
"Automated Image Guidance for Diagnosing Skin Cancer With Confocal Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Melanoma is diagnosed in approximately 124,000 people and is responsible for about 10,000 deaths every year, in the USA. Dermatologists rely on visual and dermatoscopic examination to discriminate benign melanocytic lesions from malignant, resulting in high and highly variable benign-to-malignant biopsy ratios from 8:1 to 47:1, and millions of unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging has been proven for noninvasively guiding diagnosis of melanoma in several large clinical studies. RCM imaging at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) provides sensitivity of 92-88% and specificity of 71-84%. The specificity is 2 times superior to that of dermatoscopy. RCM imaging at the DEJ is now being implemented to rule out malignancy, reduce biopsy and guide treatment. However, this is currently at only a few sites, where there are highly trained experts who can ensure that imaging is appropriately performed and images are read correctly. These experts are a small international cohort of ""early adopter"" clinicians, who have worked with RCM technology during the past decade and have become highly skilled readers. For novice (non-expert) clinicians in the wider cohort who are keen to adopt RCM, learning to read images is challenging and requires substantial effort and time. Two major technical barriers underlie the dramatic variability in diagnostic accuracy among novice clinicians. Together they limit utility, reproducibility and wider adoption of RCM. The first is user dependent subjective variability in depths near the DEJ at which images are acquired, and the second is variability in interpretation of images. We propose to address these barriers with computational ""multi-faceted"" classification modeling (innovation), image analysis and machine learning algorithms. Our specific aims are: (1) to develop and evaluate algorithms for both dermatoscopic images and RCM depth-stacks, to enable automated standardized and consistent acquisition of RCM mosaics at the DEJ in melanocytic lesions; (2) to develop and evaluate algorithms to discriminate patterns of cellular morphology at the DEJ into two classes, benign lesions versus malignant (dysplastic lesions and melanoma); and (3) to test our algorithms on patients for acquisition of RCM mosaics and classification into those two groups, with statistical validation against pathology, with statistical validation against pathology. Preliminary studies show that our algorithms can delineate the DEJ with accuracy in the range ~3-13 μm in strongly pigmented dark skin and ~5-20 μm in lightly pigmented fair skin, and can detect cellular morphologic patterns with sensitivity in the range 67-80% and specificity 78-99%. Melanocytic lesions can be distinguished from the surrounding normal skin at the DEJ with 80% classification accuracy. We are a team of researchers from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern University and University of Modena. Our success will produce standardized imaging and analysis approaches, to advance RCM for noninvasive detection of melanoma. Furthermore, these approaches can be useful for non-melanoma skin cancers, cutaneous lymphoma and other skin disorders (wider impact). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is an optical imaging technology that can guide biopsy and enable noninvasive screening and diagnosis of skin cancers. However, visual reading and interpretation of RCM images requires substantial training for clinicians. We propose to develop computer-based algorithms to assist clinicians in reading images, serve as tools for training, and accelerate wider adoption of RCM technology by dermatologists.",Automated Image Guidance for Diagnosing Skin Cancer With Confocal Microscopy,9108343,R01CA199673,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cutaneous Lymphoma', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermoscopy', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Glass', 'Health', 'Hypersensitivity skin testing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'International', 'Italy', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pigments', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Specificity', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image guided', 'innovation', 'melanoma', 'microscopic imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'optical imaging', 'quantitative imaging', 'screening', 'skin disorder', 'success', 'tool']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2016,618809,0.02430132943464767
"Development of An Integrated High Throughput Imaging and Image Analysis Platform for Muscle ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is growing awareness that weakness of muscle is a significant biomedical health issue associated with many different chronic diseases and aging. There are a variety of different diseases that affect muscle, including muscular dystrophy, fibromyalgia, cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and myasthenia gravis, each of which carries its own unique set of symptoms, accompanied by a myriad of genetic and molecular abnormalities. There is agreement within the basic research and clinical communities that important morphological characteristics of muscle fibers, such as fiber cross sectional area, fiber type, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration, and fibrosis are among many critical factors that determine the health and functionality of the muscle. Until now, the imaging equipment available is relatively low throughput and the quantification is still largely based on manual or, at best, semi-automatic methods that require extensive human intervention. In Phase I, CytoInformatics LLC has developed a software called CytoQuant, which can accurately perform automatic segmentation and provide accurate boundaries of each muscle fiber for a cropped image patch. The goal of CytoInformatics LLC in Phase II is to 1) deliver the first version of the CytoQuant software to the market, 2) develop the second version of CytoQuant by continuously improving its performance, especially in handling large scale, whole slide images, and also 3) develop an integrated multiplexing imaging hardware and analysis software framework as a seamless solution for high throughput, automated image analysis of muscle specimens. After careful investigation in Phase I (please refer to the details in business plan), we conclude that this integrated software/hardware platform with cutting-edge technologies in advanced imaging, large scale machine learning, and big data is commercially attractive to the entire muscle community including research institutes, hospitals, and pharmaceutical and athletic companies, demonstrated by strong enthusiasm among end users and many supporting letters. The specific aims are: 1) Deliver the first version of CytoQuant developed in Phase I to the market, continue to develop the second version of CytoQuant, which will focus on improving the robustness and speed in handling whole slide images; 2) Develop an integrated platform that provides unified imaging hardware and image analysis software to handle whole slide images labeled with multiple bio-relevant markers.

"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,9061011,R01HL122484,"['4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'predictive modeling', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2016,770494,0.023958751990153418
"Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) is a consortium of centers developing quantitative image features, which are proving to be valuable biomarkers of the underlying cancer biology and that can be used for assessing response to treatment and predicting clinical outcome. It is now important to discover the best quantitative imaging features for detection of response to therapeutics, to identify subtypes of cancer, and to correlate with cancer genomics. However, progress is thwarted by the lack of shared software algorithms, architectures, and resources required to compute, compare, evaluate, and disseminate these quantitative imaging features within the QIN and the broader community. We propose to develop the Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline (QIFP), a cloud-based, open source platform that will give researchers free access to these capabilities and hasten the introduction of quantitative image biomarkers into single- and multi-center clinical trials. The QIFP will facilitate assessment of the incremental value of new vs. existing image feature sets. It will also allow researchers to add their own algorithms to compute novel quantitative image features in their own studies and to disseminate them to the greater research community. To accomplish this: (1) We will create an expandable library of quantitative imaging feature algorithms capable of comprehensive characterization of the imaging phenotype of cancer. It will support a broad set of imaging modalities and algorithms implemented in a variety of languages, including algorithms that provide volumetric and time-varying assessment of lesion size, shape, edge sharpness, and pixel statistics. (2) We will build a cloud-based software architecture for creating, executing, and comparing quantitative image feature-generating pipelines, including algorithms in the library and/or those supplied by QIN or other researchers as plug-ins. QIFP will also have (a) a machine learning engine that lets users specify a dependent variable (e.g., progression-free survival) that the quantitative image features can used to predict, and (b) an evaluation engine that compares the utility of particular features for predicting the dependent variable. (3) We will assess the QIFP in four ways: (a) by its ability to recapitulate the role of known biomarkers in a related clinical trial, (b) by comparing linear measurement, metabolic tumor burden and novel combinations of the features in our library for predicting one-year progression-free survival, (c) by merging imaging features with known host-, drug- and tumor-based follicular lymphoma biomarkers in order to develop the most robust and integrative predictive model for patient outcomes, and (d) by using the QIFP to combine and to evaluate image feature algorithms developed by another QIN team and our own NCI- funded team in the study of radiogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer. The QIFP will fill a substantial gap in the science currently being carried out in the QIN and in the community by providing the tools and infrastructure to assess the value of novel quantitative imaging features of cancer, and will thereby accelerate incorporating new imaging biomarkers into single and multi-center clinical trials and into oncology practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop and evaluate a software platform that has major relevance for human health. Many investigators are pursuing image-based surrogates for response to therapy that could be used in clinical trials to predict their success/failure earlier and that are more accurate than existing surrogates. Our developments will facilitate sharing, assessing, and comparing combinations of image feature-generating software algorithms for predicting treatment response, survival, and tissue genomics, which will, in turn, greatly accelerate the development and acceptance of new and more relevant imaging surrogates for assessing cancer treatments.","Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers",9132190,U01CA187947,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Pythons', 'RNA Sequences', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Survival', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'cloud based', 'disorder subtype', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vector', 'web based interface']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,626891,0.003032481285780749
"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,9119811,K23DK101687,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intestinal Fibrosis', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Steroids', 'Surgical Management', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'blood-based biomarker', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'glycoproteomics', 'improved', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'learning strategy', 'lecturer', 'matriculation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool development', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2016,180360,0.0023885731676756726
"Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics System for Muscle DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Image evaluation of skeletal muscle biopsies is a procedure essential to research and clinical practice. Although widely used, several major limitations exist with respect to current muscle image morphometric measurement, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, retrieval, and mining procedures: 1) Although traditional morphometric parameters, such as cross-sectional area (CSA) and minimum Feret diameter, etc., serve as critical indicators for assessing muscle function, current measurements are still largely based on manual or semi-automated methods, leading to significant labor costs with large potential inter-observer variability. 2) The current archiving of muscle images is still mainy based on outdated tools such as Excel spreadsheets and computer file folders. Given a new muscle image, it is almost impossible to quickly cross-compare, visualize, query, search, and retrieve previous cases exhibiting similar image contents with comparable morphometric measures, for the purpose of either discovering novel biological co-correlations at benchside, or providing personalized diagnosis and prognosis at bedside. 3) Although a typical muscle image often contains millions of data points (pixels), in clinical practice, doctors often condense this rich information into one or two diagnostic labels and discard the rest. Novel image markers, which are not always apparent through visual inspections or not manually quantifiable, but potentially represent critical diagnostic and prognostic values for precision medicine, have not been rigorously examined. Similarly, in basic science research, only a very limited number of known measures (e.g., CSA) are considered. Some non-traditional measures, such as myofiber shapes that hold the potential to serve as new indicators of muscle functions, are not fully investigated. 4) Current muscle image analysis and searching functions are fairly low throughput. As a frontier research area, Cloud computing can handle big image data in a distributed manner by providing high-throughput computational power. However, its application to muscle images has never been explored. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, bioinformatics image mining, and Cloud computing.

"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,9132242,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'skills training', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2016,169609,0.008414334554756042
"In vivo Characterization of Stents using Intravascular OCT Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intravascular stents. Although the technology has advanced and drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent parameters include drug choice, bioresorbable versus metal, mechanical design, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To optimize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical studies. Intravascular OCT (iOCT) alone provides the resolution and contrast s necessary for in vivo interrogation of vascular healing; stent deployment issues such as malposition; and assessment of stent strut tissue coverage. The Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory at CWRU analyzes iOCT images as a service to numerous clinical and preclinical trials from around the world. An analyst takes many hours to analyze manually a single stent, greatly limiting the size and number of studies. Despite training and quality assurance measures, inter-analyst variability limits the ability to determine changes between stent types. We will develop highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibility, increase accuracy, etc. Careful evaluations/validations will be performed using our database of >1500 manually analyzed stents, and new phantom and pig studies. With the successful completion of this research and development, we will deliver well-validated, highly automated software, which will enable routine use of iOCT for sensitive evaluation of emerging stent technologies, thereby providing greatly improved treatments of cardiovascular disease. In addition, fast, robust software will contribute to clinical usage of iOCT for assessment of stent deployment and healing of a stented vessel. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year.

"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional DESCRIPTION: Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of statistical frameworks and methods for the analysis of complex ultra-high-dimensional biomedical imaging.

"Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease by imaging the left ventricle (LV) of the heart at rest and then after either exercise or pharmacologically-induce stress to reveal ischemia. However, acquisitions are heavily operator dependent, two-dimensional (2D), and interpretation is generally based on qualitative assessment. While a variety of quantitative 2D approaches have been proposed in the research literature, none have been shown to be superior to the still highly variable qualitative visual comparison of rest/stress echocardiographic image sequences for detecting ischemic disease. Here, we propose that the way forward must focus on a new computational image analysis paradigm for quantitative 4D (three spatial dimensions plus time) stress echocardiography. Our strategy integrates information derived from both radiofrequency (RF) and B-mode echocardiographic images acquired using a matrix array probe. The integrated analysis system will yield accurate and robust measures of strain and strain rate - at rest, stress and differentially between rest and stress - that will identify myocardial tissue at-risk after dobutamine-induced stress. This work wil involve the development of novel (1) phase-sensitive, correlation-based RF ultrasound speckle tracking to estimate mid-wall displacements, (2) ma- chine learning techniques to localize the LV bounding surfaces and their displacements from B-mode data, (3) a meshless integration approach based on radial basis functions (RBFs) and Bayesian reasoning/sparse coding to estimate dense spatiotemporal parameters of strain and strain rate and (4) non-rigid registration of rest and stress image sequences to develop unique, 3D differential deformation parameters. The quantitative approach will be validated with implanted sonomicrometers and microsphere-derived flows using an acute canine model of stenosis. The ability of deformation and differential deformation derived from 4D stress echocardiography to detect new myocardial tissue at-risk in the presence of existing infarction will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic canine model of infarction with superimposed ischemia. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility of our deformation and differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Three main collaborators will team on this work. A group led by Matthew O'Donnell from the University of Washington will develop the RF-based speckle tracking methods. An image analysis group led by the PI James Duncan at Yale University will develop methods for segmentation, shape tracking, dense displacement integration and strain computation. A cardiology/physiology group under Dr. Albert Sinusas at Yale will perform the acute and chronic canine studies and the human stress echo studies. A consultant from Philips Medical Systems will work with the entire team to bridge the ultrasound image acquisition technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The detection and diagnosis of coronary artery disease are commonly performed using stress echocardiography, a test that is performed 3 million times in the United States annually. Our new methods will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation in 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) due to stress using a cost efficient and noninvasive imaging technology. The resulting methodology may lead to more sensitive and accurate detection of stress-induced ischemia that will better guide clinical decision making.",Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography,9002898,R01HL121226,"['Acute', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiology', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diastole', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dobutamine', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Exercise', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Implant', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Radial', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stenosis', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Ventricular', 'Visual', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'elastography', 'in vivo', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'radio frequency', 'radiofrequency', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,776460,0.025305969559448933
"Digital Pathology_Accuracy Viewing Behavior and Image Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 1.4 million women per year depend on pathologists to accurately interpret breast biopsies for a diagnosis of benign disease or cancer. Diagnostic errors are alarmingly frequent and likely lead to altered patient treatment, especially at the thresholds of atypical hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ, where up to 50% of cases are misclassified. The causes underlying these errors remain largely unknown.  Technology similar to Google Maps now allows pan and zoom manipulation of high-resolution digital images of glass microscope slides. This technology has virtually replaced the microscope in medical schools and is rapidly diffusing into U.S. pathology practices. No research has evaluated the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists' interpretion of digital images vs. glass slides. However, these ""digital slides"" offer a novel opportunity to study the accuracy, efficiency, and viewing behavior of a large number of pathologists as they manipulate and interpret images. The innovative analytic techniques proposed in this application are similar to those used to improve the performance of pilots and air traffic controllers. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Digital Image vs. Glass Slides: To compare the interpretive accuracy of pathologists viewing digitized slide images over the Internet to their performance viewing original glass slides under a microscope. A randomized national sample of pathologists (N=200) will interpret 240 test cases in one or both formats in two phases. Measures will include a diagnostic assessment for each test case and for digital slides, cursor- (i.e., mouse) tracking data and region of interest (ROI) markings. Completion of this aim will establish benchmarks for the comparative diagnostic accuracy of whole-slide digital images.  Aim 2. Interpretive Screening Behavior: To identify visual scanning patterns associated with diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Detailed simultaneous eye-tracking and cursor-tracking data will be collected on 60 additional pathologists while they interpret digital slides to complement data from Aim 1. Viewing patterns will be analyzed from computer representations of raw movement data. Videos depicting accurate, efficient visual scanning and cursor movement will be valuable tools in educating the next generation of digital pathologists. Aim 3. Image Analyses: To examine and classify the image characteristics (including color, texture, and structure) of ROIs captured in Aims 1 and 2. Computer-based statistical learning techniques will be used to identify image characteristics that lead to correct and incorrect diagnoses. Characteristics of both diagnostic and distracting ROIs will be identified, linking all three aims. In summary, we will determine whether digitized whole-slide images are diagnostically equivalent to original glass slides. Our in-depth scientific evaluation of viewing patterns and characteristics of ROIs identified by pathologists will be critical to understanding diagnostic errors and sources of distraction. Optimization of viewing techniques will improve diagnostic performance and thus, the quality of clinical care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pathologist errors in the interpretation of biopsy specimens can result in significant harm to patients. Digital imaging technology is rapidly diffusing into medical settings, providing a unique opportunity to obtain data on the process used by pathologists when interpreting slides. The results will provide the foundation needed to improve interpretive accuracy and efficiency, support quality improvement efforts, and ultimately reduce the burden of misdiagnosis on patients and the health care delivery system.",Digital Pathology_Accuracy Viewing Behavior and Image Characterization,8970690,R01CA172343,"['Adoption', 'Air', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Atypical hyperplasia', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Breast biopsy', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Error Sources', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Rural Hospitals', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientific Evaluation', 'Slide', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative', 'computer monitor', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital media', 'distraction', 'eye hand coordination', 'health care delivery', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'migration', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pedagogy', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transmission process']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,624643,0.011917332823263113
"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management. Aim 3) Disseminate software and knowledge, via a) deploying our software to the clinic at Penn as well as to selected collaborating institutions, in order to test and further refine the software accordig to feedback; b) freely distributing our software to the research community; c) organizing various educational activities for both clinicians and informaticians, and setting up and maintaining support forums. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advanced computer analysis methodology for interpretation of radiologic images of cancer, emphasizing brain and breast cancer. The functionality of the software will substantially transcend limitations of current analysis of cancer images, and will open the way for more precise and effective surgical planning as well as for more specific diagnosis of cancer based on its imaging characteristics, eventually leading to individualized medicine.",Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer,9135254,U24CA189523,"['Algorithmic Software', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational Activities', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging probe', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular subtypes', 'open source', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'web site']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U24,2016,649474,-0.059912351722170284
"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue identification and quantification plays a significant role in the study of aging and age-related diseases. For example, the accumulation of fat in the human body and its regional distribution with aging is associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in muscle composition are strongly linked to decline of muscle strength, decreased mobility caused by aging, or musculoskeletal disorders. Especially interesting is analysis of longitudinal changes of morphometric descriptors that is significant for studying the aging process and for the diagnosis and prevention of age-related diseases.  Medical imaging has emerged as a major tool for estimation of body composition mainly due to being non- invasive and producing multi-dimensional information. Nowadays MRI and CT acquisition is a central component of clinical trials. An abundance of imaging data is collected, but this wealth of information has not been utilized to full extent. Therefore research on image analysis techniques for tissue quantification that are reproducible and can be used on large-scale clinical trials is of particular importance.  The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse body composition data from modern MRI and CT imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who are healthy versus those who are not. The goal of our work is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the abdomen and lower extremities and to study the relationship between body morphological changes and age-related pathologies.  We will build upon recent advances in medical image computing to segment muscle, regional adipose tissue, and bone in clinical CT and MRI scans. We will also develop image registration procedures to achieve intra- and inter-subject correspondence and make efficient use of information provided by multi-modal and multi-temporal imaging data collected in clinical trials (aim 1). After these methods have been developed, we will address the hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging can increase the prognostic accuracy of age-related pathologies (aim2). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic and affect the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million don't know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function. This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition and its changes with increasing age to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES,9044803,SC3GM113754,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delaware', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Techniques', 'Thigh structure', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age related', 'biophysical model', 'bone', 'effective therapy', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'statistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY,SC3,2016,63620,0.012645454976479205
"Prediction of IPF Progression Using Imaging Patterns ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. These designations of natural history assume great importance at a time when insights from preclinical studies are beginning to translate into therapies targeted at specific key pathways of fibrosis. Stratification of disease phenotypes is important in order to decipher the effects of newly approved therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individual patients.  Various prognostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with overall survival; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good early predictive models exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF from multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier on scans annotated manually by an expert radiologist, analyzing in separate aims static image features present on baseline scans and transitional (difference) morphologic features on sequential scans that herald progressive disease. Features of anatomic distribution will be explored and reproducible imaging features will be expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score. Aggregate prognostic models using Cox proportional regression models will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Finally, we will externally validate our models in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitia Lung Disease Program.  Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that anticipate disease course in patients with IPF. We anticipate that these models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions for the choice in treatment as well as future research to define more homogeneous cohorts for testing new safe and effective therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rates of progression are highly variable, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using newer drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to predict disease course in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.",Prediction of IPF Progression Using Imaging Patterns,9122467,R21HL123477,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Derivation procedure', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hamman-Rich syndrome', 'Health', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Stable Disease', 'Stratification', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'data archive', 'digital imaging', 'disease classification', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'effective therapy', 'functional decline', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'respiratory', 'success', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2016,107290,0.005890320155059118
"Analyzing Large-Scale Neuroimaging Data in Alzheimer's Disease Analyzing Large-Scale Neuroimaging Data in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract: Advances in imaging technology offer great opportunities to study Alzheimer's disease (AD) in many ways that are not previously possible. This leads to various large-scale imaging studies, i.e., ADNI, for discovering AD-related imaging biomarkers. In these imaging studies, image registration plays a key role in reducing the confounding inter-subject variability and also enhancing the statistical power of identifying abnormalities related to AD. However, automated processing of large-scale imaging data, i.e., involving anything from hundreds to thousands of 3D brain images, is not trivial and requires dedicated computational tools. The goal of this project is to develop a series of novel deep multi-layer groupwise registration methods for effective, efficient and simultaneous registration of all brain images with possibly large anatomical and appearance differences. Also, to accommodate for new images acquired from the on-going large-scale imaging study, an efficient incremental groupwise registration method will be further developed to avoid time- and resource-consuming re-registration of all new and existing images from scratch. Our key idea is to break down the complex groupwise registration problem into hierarchical sets of small- scale registration tasks that can be solved easily, thus making the large-scale registration more manageable and fast. Specifically, 1) for fast initialization of large-scale groupwise registration of brain images, we will develop in Aim 1 a hierarchical learning-based landmark detection algorithm, based on random forest regression, to detect salient anatomical landmarks and then jointly align all images with detected landmarks. Since all images are distributed in a complex manifold and also the registration of similar images is much faster and more accurate, we propose to first build a graph to link each image only with similar images, and then formulate groupwise registration as dynamic graph shrinkage. This avoids direct registration of each image to the group-mean image as done in the conventional methods, thus improving both speed and accuracy. 2) To significantly speed up and also improve this single-layer graph-based groupwise registration, we will further develop in Aim 2 a deep multi-layer groupwise registration by simultaneous layer-by-layer graph construction and layer-wise registration. 3) Finally, to significantly increase both the speed and accuracy of registration for new images acquired from on-going large-scale imaging study, we will develop in Aim 3 a novel incremental groupwise registration method to reuse previous registration results of existing images for guiding registration of new images. Specifically, each new image can be quickly registered to the common space of existing images by finding its most similar existing image(s). Accordingly, all new and existing images will become similar in the common space and then can be quickly updated for their overall groupwise registration. All computational tools developed will be made freely available to the research community, for accelerating the imaging study of Alzheimer's disease. Narrative Description of Project Modern imaging techniques offer great opportunities to study Alzheimer's disease (AD) in many ways that are not previously possible. This leads to increasing number of large-scale imaging studies, including ADNI. However, the overwhelmingly big data poses new challenges to researchers in automated data processing. Thus, modern computational tools are expected to be able to handle the vast amount of data within a manageable time frame. In light of this, we aim to solve this large-scale spatial registration problem – a critical step directly related to accuracy and precision of imaging biomarkers to be discovered for AD. In particular, we will develop novel deep multi-layer groupwise registration methods for effective, efficient and simultaneous registration of all brain images with possibly large anatomical and appearance differences. Also, to accommodate for new images acquired from the on-going study, an efficient incremental groupwise registration will be further developed to avoid time- and resource-consuming re-registration of all new and existing images from scratch.

"Retinal connectome: mobile game and crowdsourcing algorithms for EyeWire II ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An online community called EyeWire proved that volunteers can be motivated to reconstruct neural circuits through an activity resembling a 3D coloring book. EyeWire helped discover space-time speciﬁcity of the wiring from bipolar cells to starburst amacrine cells, which suggested a surprising new model for direction selectivity in the retina. Motivated by this success, we are preparing to launch EyeWire II, which aims to map the entire retinal connectome, yielding the ﬁrst complete wiring diagram for any region of the mammalian CNS. This ambitious goal will require innovative advances in virtually every component of EyeWire. The underlying electron microscopic image of the retina will be replaced by a new image with increased size and quality. A new artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) will be trained using a new software package for 3D deep learning. While the improved AI is expected to reduce the amount of human effort required to reconstruct a neuron, the number of neurons targeted for reconstruction will also increase dramatically. Overall, the absolute amount of human effort required will increase rather than decrease. Therefore it is critical to improve EyeWire's crowdsourcing to (1) mobilize more human effort and (2) to use human effort more efﬁciently. This project aims to radically improve both aspects, thereby making the retinal connectome achievable by EyeWire II. In Aim 1, we will create a compelling mobile game with the target of engaging 10x more people than the existing EyeWire community. In Aim 2, we will develop and deploy new crowdsourcing algorithms that extract wisdom from the crowd by weighted voting and optimally assign players to tasks. The Aims will be achieved through collaboration between three organizations. Wired Differently, Inc. (WD) is a new Boston-based nonproﬁt organization dedicated to ""citizen neuroscience"" that was recently spun out of MIT. WD currently operates EyeWire in collaboration with the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. The Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) at Carnegie Mellon University will offer a project-based class to its master's students to design and prototype new ideas for the mobile game. Both Aims will produce code and algorithms that will be made publicly available, and could have broad impact on citizen science. As the ﬁrst crowdsourcing of 3D image analysis, the code produced by Aim 1 could be useful for the many other kinds of 3D images found in biomedical research. The crowdsourcing algorithms of Aim 2 are potentially useful for any citizen science project facing the challenge of obtaining accurate and reliable results from a heterogeneous group of volunteers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeWire II will increase public understanding of the structure of the nervous system. The retinal connectome could aid those attempting to develop blindness therapies based on regenerating cells and their wiring. It could also aid the development of retinal prosthetics that directly stimulate ganglion cells and computationally emulate the bypassed micro circuitry. 1        ",Retinal connectome: mobile game and crowdsourcing algorithms for EyeWire II,9076876,UH2CA203710,"['Algorithms', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blindness', 'Books', 'Boston', 'Breathing', 'Bypass', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electrons', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Love', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'New York', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Social Interaction', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Volunteer Group', 'Voting', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'citizen science', 'connectome', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'innovation', 'microscopic imaging', 'neural circuit', 'online community', 'pleasure', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'retinal prosthesis', 'simulation', 'starburst amacrine cell', 'success', 'university student', 'visual neuroscience', 'volunteer']",NCI,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,UH2,2016,320900,-0.009872461015488696
"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images.

"Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the advent of whole slide digital scanners, histopathology slides can be digitized into very high-resolution digital images, realizing a new ""big data"" stream that can potentially rival ""omics data"" in size and complexity. Just as with the analysis of high-throughput genetic and expression data, the application of sophisticated image analytic tools and data pipelines can render the often passive data of digital pathology (DP) archives into a powerful source for: (a) rich quantitative insights into cancer biology and (b) companion diagnostic decision support tools for precision medicine. Digital pathology enabled companion diagnostic tests could yield predictions of cancer risk and aggressiveness in a manner similar to molecular diagnostic tests. However, prior to widespread clinical adoption of DP, extensive evaluation of clinical interpretation of DP imaging (DPI) and accompanying decision support tools needs to be undertaken. Wider acceptance of DPI by the cancer community (clinical and research) is hampered by lack of a publicly available, open access image informatics platform for easily viewing, managing, and quantitatively analyzing DPIs. While some commercial platforms exist for viewing and analyzing DPI data, none of these platforms are freely available. Open source image viewing/management platforms that cater to the radiology (e.g. XNAT) and computational biology communities are typically not conducive to handling very large file sizes as encountered with DPI datasets.  This multi-PI U24 proposal seeks to expand on an existing, freely available pathology image viewer (Sedeen Image Viewer) to create a pathology informatics platform (PIIP) for managing, annotating, sharing, and quantitatively analyzing DPI data. Sedeen was designed as a universal platform for DPI (by addressing several proprietary scanner formats and ""big data"" challenges), to provide (1) reliable and useful image annotation tools, and (2) for image registration and analysis of DPI data. Additionally, Sedeen has become an application for cropping large DPIs so that they can be input into programs such as Matlab or ImageJ. Sedeen has been freely available to the public for three years, with over 160 unique users from over 20 countries.  Building on the initial successes of Sedeen and its existing user base, our intent is to massively increase dissemination of DPI and algorithms in the cancer research community and clinical trial efforts, as well as to contribute towards the adoption of a rational and standardized set of DP operational conventions. This unique project will allow end users with different needs and technical backgrounds to seamlessly (a) archive and manage, (b) share, and (c) visualize their DPI data, acquired from different sites, formats, and platforms. The PIIP will provide a unified user interface for third party algorithms (nuclear segmentation, color normalization, biomarker quantification, radiology-pathology fusion) and will allow for algorithmic evaluation upon data arising from a plurality of source sites. By partnering with professional societies, we envision that the PIIP user base will expand to include the oncology, pathology, radiology, and pharmaceutical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will result in the further development of advanced functionality of the already existing digital pathology image informatics platform (PIIP) with an established user-base for cancer research. Such an enhanced platform will provide the much-needed foundation for advancing (a) routine clinical adoption of digital pathology for primary diagnosis and (b) training and validation of companion diagnostic decision support systems based off histopathology. Thus, the project is aligned with the NCI's goal to foster innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving human health.","Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management",9145647,U24CA199374,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Community Trial', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Language', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Students', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research site', 'companion diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput analysis', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'open source', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user friendly software', 'validation studies']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U24,2016,605366,0.021255942993133114
"Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by loss of bone mass and structural deterioration leading to increased risk of fracture. Currently, osteoporosis is diagnosed by measurement of areal bone mineral density by dual- energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, the majority of fractures occur in both women and men who are not classified as osteoporotic by current DXA criteria (T-score = -2.5). As a 2-dimensional (2D) technology, DXA does not provide information about 3-dimensional (3D) bone structure, shape and geometry, which substantially contribute to bone strength and resistance to fracture. Finite element (FE) analysis of quantitative computed tomography (QCT) images can provide 3D structure and strength measurements but QCT is impractical for widespread clinical use because of high radiation exposure and expense. In contrast, DXA is widely available, inexpensive and has low radiation exposure. What is needed is a method by which DXA images can be used to generate 3D shape models that incorporate bone structure and geometry. However, fractures are complex events influenced by other factors including age, race, body mass index, risk of falls, and prior medical and fracture history. Even sophisticated measurements of bone density, structure, and strength may not be able to predict fractures accurately. Machine learning is an emerging field in which models are created by ""learning"" from previous data. These models can incorporate various factors and be used to classify or predict outcomes for new data. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced analyses of widely available DXA images that incorporate structural and strength information and statistical modeling using machine learning to incorporate additional risk factors will better identify patient at high risk of osteoporotic fracture. This hypothesis will be tested using QCT and DXA data from previous studies to generate 3D statistical shape models that describe variability in proximal femur morphology. By aligning 2D DXA images to the models, patient-specific 3D models will be reconstructed for quantitative analyses and combined with FE analysis to estimate bone strength. Machine learning models will be used to incorporate these novel measurements, demographics, and various risk factors for fracture to predict incident fractures in two very large, prospective studies. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to increase the diagnostic utility of DXA, a safe, non-invasive, and widely available technology, by applying novel image processing and statistical techniques to predict fractures more accurately.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 50% of women and 25% of men over age 50 are destined to suffer an osteoporotic fracture during their remaining lifetime. Unfortunately, the current standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, DXA, does not predict most fractures. This research will develop advanced analyses of DXA images and use machine learning to improve individualized fracture risk assessment.            ",Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA,8869145,K99AR067883,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'American', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Density', 'Cadaver', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Height', 'Hip Fractures', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Osteopenia', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Postmenopause', 'Prospective Studies', 'Race', 'Radiation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'bone geometry', 'bone mass', 'bone strength', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnosis standard', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'men', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2015,91800,0.0031628593303188375
"Automated Retinal Analysis for Detection of Age Related Macular Degeneration ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study focuses on age-related macular degeneration (AMD) because, left untreated, it is the leading cause of blindness in the adult US population over 50. The goals of this program are twofold. First, the focus is to develop new screening tools to detect individuals with the intermediate stage of AMD, that are otherwise asymptomatic for vision loss, at a stage where they can be referred to a clinician for treatment and follow up, and when vision more likely can be preserved. The second goal is to develop Automated Retinal Image Analysis (ARIA) tools that help characterize Geographic Atrophy (GA), for which novel treatments are being investigated. We are developing data-driven algorithms for AMD screening which leverage recent advances in machine learning and machine intelligence and do not rely on detecting and counting or sizing drusen (a procedure which can be error prone). Instead, our method analyzes a fundus image as a whole using an image classification paradigm, and may also exploit ancillary patient information. Our goal is to use the AREDS dbGaP that includes thousands of images from hundreds of patients and offers a unique opportunity to develop and test these algorithms on a scale that has not previously been possible. Our team consists of the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute, which will serve as the clinical analysis test site, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, which will conduct the automated screening software tool analysis, development and testing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are twofold. First, in order to work towards improving outcome, our goal is to develop novel software screening tools that allow for the automated detection of individuals with the intermediate stage AMD so that they may be referred to clinicians for follow up and treatment at an earlier stage than would otherwise occur. Second, we will develop new tools to characterize the evolution of GA, for which new treatments are being developed and tested. Our project is a secondary study on the AREDS dbGaP, which will be leveraged for the development and validation of these new algorithms on a scale never before attempted.                ",Automated Retinal Analysis for Detection of Age Related Macular Degeneration,8826350,R21EY024310,"['Adult', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biotechnology', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Cataract', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Discipline', 'Drusen', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myopia', 'National Eye Institute', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Pigmentation physiologic function', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'age related', 'bioimaging', 'computer program', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'geographic atrophy', 'improved', 'neovascular', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'tool']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,215393,-0.011876240283728554
"Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopes to image cells or other biological samples. Even for small-scale experiments, the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex, and automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye.  We will continue our development of CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org) to meet this strong and growing demand for software to analyze biological images. CellProfiler is a versatile, open-source toolbox. Using its point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized workflow of image-analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. It can extract valuable biological information from images quickly, even for high-throughput experiments, while increasing objectivity and statistical power in microscopy experiments.  Published only seven years ago, CellProfiler is already an important and widely used tool: it is launched 100,000+ times per year by users around the world and has been cited in more than 800 papers from 600 distinct laboratories. The software evolves in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  We propose to improve CellProfiler's capabilities in order to enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler:  First, microscopy experiments are rapidly expanding in both scale and scope, and are beginning to push CellProfiler's limits, particularly when they involve larger images (e.g., for tissue samples, cellular microarrays, large field-of-view cameras), multi-dimensional images (time-lapse and three-dimensional imaging), images for morphological profiling, and novel microscopy types (super-resolution and single-molecule imaging). We will upgrade CellProfiler's capabilities to serve these needs and add proven, state-of-the-art algorithms for image processing (especially segmentation and filtering for non-fluorescence images), time-lapse and 3D analysis, and novel microscopy types. We will also add features and usability improvements requested by the large CellProfiler community.  Second, we will enable researchers to create sophisticated bioimaging analysis workflows by expanding CellProfiler's interoperability with complementary software (e.g., MATLAB, ImageJ, MicroManager, KNIME).  Third, we will disseminate CellProfiler and provide user, educator, and developer support. There is great demand for our online forum, downloadable materials, and in-person tutorials (1,000+ attendees so far).  These improvements to the first, and still preeminent, open-source software for modular, high- throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from microscopy images across all disciplines within biology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our popular, user-friendly, open-source image analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org), to accommodate the increasing scale and scope of modern microscopy experiments.",Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software,8910751,R01GM089652,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Movement', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Slide', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cellular imaging', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open source', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2015,589523,0.05363640144981404
"Image analysis for high-throughput C. elegans infection and metabolism assays DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput screening (HTS) is a technique for searching large libraries of chemical or genetic perturbants, to find new treatments for a disease or to better understand disease pathways. As automated image analysis for cultured cells has improved, microscopy has emerged as one of the most powerful and informative ways to analyze screening samples. However, many diseases and biological pathways can be better studied in whole animals-particularly diseases that involve organ systems and multicellular interactions, such as metabolism and infection. The worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established and effective model organism, used by thousands of researchers worldwide to study complex biological processes. Samples of C. elegans can be robotically prepared and imaged by high-throughput microscopy, but existing image-analysis methods are insuf- ficient for most assays. In this project, image-analysis algorithms that are capable of scoring high-throughput assays of C. elegans will be developed.  The algorithms will be tested and refined in three high-throughput screens, which will uncover chemical and genetic regulators of fat metabolism and infection: (1) A C. elegans viability assay to identify modulators of infection. The proposed algorithms use a probabilistic shape model of C. elegans in order to identify and mea- sure individual worms even when the animals touch or cross. These methods are the basis for quantifying many other phenotypes, including body morphology and subtle variations in reporter signal levels. (2) A C. elegans lipid assay to identify genes that regulate fat metabolism. The algorithms proposed for illumination correction, level-set-based foreground segmentation, well-edge detection, and artifact removal will result in improved or- business in high-throughput experiments. (3) A fluorescence gene expression assay to identify regulators of the response of the C. elegans host to Staphylococcus aureus infection. The proposed techniques for constructing anatomical maps of C. elegans will make it possible to quantify a variety of changes in fluorescent localization patterns in a biologically relevant way.  In addition to discovering new metabolism- and infection-related drugs and genetic regulators through these specific screens, this work will provide the C. elegans community with (a) a new framework for extracting mor- phological features from C. elegans for quantitative analysis of this organism, and (b) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms enabling the discovery of genetic pathways, chemical probes, and drug can- didates in whole organism high-throughput screens relevant to a variety of diseases.  This work is a close collaboration with C. elegans experts Fred Ausubel and Gary Ruvkun at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, with Polina Golland and Tammy Riklin-Raviv, experts in model-based segmentation and statistical image analysis at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and with Anne Carpenter, developer of open-source image analysis software at the Broad Institute. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large-scale screening experiments that test the effects of thousands of chemicals or genetic perturbants by microscopy and image analysis can discover new treatments and help biomedical scientists understand dis- ease mechanisms. Microscopy screens of cultured cells are routine, but researchers wish to study complex processes like metabolism and infection in a whole animal like the tiny worm Caenorhabditis elegans, for which existing image analysis methods are insufficient. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to automatically identify and measure C. elegans in microscopy images, thereby making it possible for researchers worldwide to screen a wide variety of complex biological processes related to human disease.",Image analysis for high-throughput C. elegans infection and metabolism assays,8786567,R01GM095672,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Businesses', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data Quality', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Targeting', 'Excision', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lighting', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Microsporidia', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Engineering', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'body system', 'chemical genetics', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'follow-up', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'interest', 'lipid metabolism', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'two-dimensional']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2015,309263,0.0034092290399068575
"Ultra-miniaturized single fiber probe for functional brain imaging in freely moving animals ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microscope techniques to image inside brain tissue are generally limited by poor depth penetration. Micro-endoscopy, wherein a probe is physically inserted into the tissue, can overcome this limitation in depth penetration, but at the expense of invasiveness and tissue damage due to the size of the probe. Our goal here is to palliate these problems by developing an ultra-miniature microendoscope probe based on a single, lensless optical fiber.  The direct transmission of an image through an optical ﬁber is diﬃcult because spatial information becomes scrambled upon propagation. We have recently demonstrated an image transmission strategy where spatial information is ﬁrst converted to spectral information. Our strategy is based on a principle of spread-spectrum encoding, borrowed from wireless communications, wherein object pixels are converted into distinct spectral codes that span the full bandwidth of the object spectrum. Image recovery is performed by numerical inversion of the detected spectrum at the ﬁber output. We have provided a simple demonstration of spread-spectrum encoding using macroscopic Fabry-Perot etalons. Our technique enables the 2D imaging of luminous (i.e. fluorescent or bioluminescent) objects with high throughput independent of pixel number. Moreover, it is insensitive to ﬁber bending, contains no moving parts, and opens the attractive possibility of extreme miniaturization down to the size of a single optical fiber.  Our goal here is to develop, characterize, and establish the versatility of a new class of ultra-miniature fiber probes that can provide functional 2D brain imaging at arbitrary depths and with minimal tissue damage. Our strategy will involve probe development, machine-learning algorithm development, and the actual demonstration of microendoscopic imaging in freely moving behaving animals.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have recently demonstrated a strategy to image through a single, lensless optical fiber. We propose to develop this into an ultraminiaturized microendoscope for functional brain imaging with minimal surgical damage in freely moving behaving animals.            ",Ultra-miniaturized single fiber probe for functional brain imaging in freely moving animals,9053610,R21EY026310,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Fiber', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Miniaturization', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Penetration', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'imprint', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lens', 'miniaturize', 'minimally invasive', 'optical fiber', 'optical imaging', 'photonics', 'portability', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'targeted imaging', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NEI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2015,239361,0.0008882233989427568
"Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quest for fast image acquisition speed has always been a perennial topic in the MRI community. To reduce the acquisition time for maximal spatial and temporal resolution, modern MRI protocols usually perform reduced acquisitions below the Nyquist rate. The reduced data is then used to reconstruct the image through advanced reconstruction techniques that leverage some prior information about the MRI system (e.g., parallel imaging) and/or MR signal (e.g., compressed sensing). Since such prior information is patient and system specific, recent techniques obtain the prior information using training data obtained through an empirical calibration procedure. All existing methods assume the prior models are linear. Since the intrinsic nonlinear relationship in the training data cannot be characterized in such simple models, the reconstruction is degraded by the inaccuracy of the prior information. Nonlinear learning from the training data have proven to be more powerful in machine learning because it is more general and includes the linear model as a special case. However, it is usually more challenging to learn the nonlinear models and even more challenging to incorporate the model in reconstruction due to the increased degree of freedom. We recently have introduced a novel concept of ""kernel"" in MR reconstruction to address the above challenges timely. Our preliminary results on parallel imaging and sparsity-constrained reconstruction demonstrate that the kernel-based algorithms improve the reconstruction quality over the original algorithms with linear prior models. Built upon our strong preliminary results, the objective of this application is to develop an innovative kernel-based framework for MR image reconstruction from undersampled data. This framework does not require explicit knowledge of nonlinear mapping (as in preliminary work) such that a broader family of nonlinear functions can be explored for different clinical applications. The proposed work is expected to advance the field of MR image reconstruction vertically. Specifically, the successful completion of the proposed project will result in a general framework leading to many new algorithms (including two developed in this project) for reconstruction from reduced acquisition. Therefore, virtually all of current clinical MRI could benefit from the improved resolution, image quality, and/or reduced acquisition times that the new framework will facilitate or the novel applications i may enable.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is to develop a general framework and two specific new techniques to improve the spatial resolution and/or reduce the scan time in magnetic resonance imaging and evaluate the performance of the techniques for 3D parallel imaging and quantitative imaging in brain. The development of such novel fast imaging techniques may greatly enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. Therefore the project will potentially benefit numerous subjects and the healthcare system.            ",Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling,8953102,R21EB020861,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Family', 'Freedom', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2015,180330,0.03011953007360069
"Graph-Based Medical Image Segmentation in 3D and 4D DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive continuation of our Phase-II project. After successfully fulfilling all of its aims, our framework for optimal multi-surface andor multi-object n-D biomedical image segmentation was further extended, validated, and its practical utility demonstrated in clinical and translational image analysis tasks. This Phase-III proposal will develop several important extensions addressing identified limitations of the current framework and specifically focusing on applicability of the methodology to translational and routine healthcare tasks. Novel methods will be developed for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions and surfaces, automated design of cost functions from segmentation examples, and overcoming failures of automated techniques in routine diagnostic quality images by allowing limited and highly efficient expert input to guide the image segmentation processes.  We hypothesize that advanced graph-based image segmentation algorithms merging machine- learning-derived segmentation parameters and image-specific expert guidance will significantly increase quantitative analysis performance in routinely acquired complex diagnostic-quality medical images across diverse application areas. We propose to: 1) Develop 3D, 4D, and generally n-D approaches for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions (objects) and surfaces. 2) Develop methods for data-driven automated design of cost functions used for surface-based, region-based, and surface-and-region-based graph search image segmentation. 3) Develop ""Just-Enough-Interaction"" (JEI) approaches for efficient ""real-time"" medical image segmentation, thus achieving robust clinical applicability of quantitative medical image analysis. 4) Assess performance of all developed methods in translational research settings; determine performance in quantitative medical image analysis and radiation oncology treatment planning workflow. As a result, our project will enable routine quantification and therefore personalized care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Phases I and II of this research project multi-surface and/or multi-object n-D biomedical image segmentation and demonstrated its practical utility.

"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale. Clinical applications include the quantification of angiogenesis in tumors and tissue implants, and the quantification of neurovascular effects in neurodegenerative disease models.",Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular,8920669,R00LM011390,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'memory process', 'model building', 'mouse model', 'neuronal cell body', 'next generation', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor growth']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R00,2015,239130,0.005405690148939243
"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,8842639,R01EY023279,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Papilledema', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability burden', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2015,332955,0.006006276861475071
"Automated Image Guidance for Diagnosing Skin Cancer With Confocal Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Melanoma is diagnosed in approximately 124,000 people and is responsible for about 10,000 deaths every year, in the USA. Dermatologists rely on visual and dermatoscopic examination to discriminate benign melanocytic lesions from malignant, resulting in high and highly variable benign-to-malignant biopsy ratios from 8:1 to 47:1, and millions of unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging has been proven for noninvasively guiding diagnosis of melanoma in several large clinical studies. RCM imaging at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) provides sensitivity of 92-88% and specificity of 71-84%. The specificity is 2 times superior to that of dermatoscopy. RCM imaging at the DEJ is now being implemented to rule out malignancy, reduce biopsy and guide treatment. However, this is currently at only a few sites, where there are highly trained experts who can ensure that imaging is appropriately performed and images are read correctly. These experts are a small international cohort of ""early adopter"" clinicians, who have worked with RCM technology during the past decade and have become highly skilled readers. For novice (non-expert) clinicians in the wider cohort who are keen to adopt RCM, learning to read images is challenging and requires substantial effort and time. Two major technical barriers underlie the dramatic variability in diagnostic accuracy among novice clinicians. Together they limit utility, reproducibility and wider adoption of RCM. The first is user dependent subjective variability in depths near the DEJ at which images are acquired, and the second is variability in interpretation of images. We propose to address these barriers with computational ""multi-faceted"" classification modeling (innovation), image analysis and machine learning algorithms. Our specific aims are: (1) to develop and evaluate algorithms for both dermatoscopic images and RCM depth-stacks, to enable automated standardized and consistent acquisition of RCM mosaics at the DEJ in melanocytic lesions; (2) to develop and evaluate algorithms to discriminate patterns of cellular morphology at the DEJ into two classes, benign lesions versus malignant (dysplastic lesions and melanoma); and (3) to test our algorithms on patients for acquisition of RCM mosaics and classification into those two groups, with statistical validation against pathology, with statistical validation against pathology. Preliminary studies show that our algorithms can delineate the DEJ with accuracy in the range ~3-13 μm in strongly pigmented dark skin and ~5-20 μm in lightly pigmented fair skin, and can detect cellular morphologic patterns with sensitivity in the range 67-80% and specificity 78-99%. Melanocytic lesions can be distinguished from the surrounding normal skin at the DEJ with 80% classification accuracy. We are a team of researchers from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern University and University of Modena. Our success will produce standardized imaging and analysis approaches, to advance RCM for noninvasive detection of melanoma. Furthermore, these approaches can be useful for non-melanoma skin cancers, cutaneous lymphoma and other skin disorders (wider impact).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is an optical imaging technology that can guide biopsy and enable noninvasive screening and diagnosis of skin cancers. However, visual reading and interpretation of RCM images requires substantial training for clinicians. We propose to develop computer-based algorithms to assist clinicians in reading images, serve as tools for training, and accelerate wider adoption of RCM technology by dermatologists.            ",Automated Image Guidance for Diagnosing Skin Cancer With Confocal Microscopy,8946754,R01CA199673,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cutaneous Lymphoma', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermoscopy', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Glass', 'Hypersensitivity skin testing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'International', 'Italy', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pigments', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Specificity', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image guided', 'innovation', 'melanoma', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'optical imaging', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'screening', 'skin disorder', 'success', 'tool']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2015,658985,0.02430132943464767
"BIGDATA Small Project Structurization and Direct Search of Medical Image Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): IBM estimates that 30% of the entire data in the world is medical information. Medical images occupy a significant portion of medical records with approximately 100 million scans in US and growing every year. In addition, the data size from each scan steadfastly increases as the image resolution improves. These BigData are not structured and due to lack of standardized imaging protocols, they are highly heterogeneous with different spatial resolutions, contrasts, slice orientations, etc. In this project, we will deelop a technology to structure and search medical imaging information, which will make the past data available for education and evidence-based clinical decision-making. In this grant, we will focus on brain MRI, which comprises the largest portion of MRI data. The target community will be physicians who make decisions and the patients will be the ultimate beneficiaries. Currently, radiological image data are stored in clinical database called PACS. The image data in PACS are not structured. Consequently, once the diagnosis of a patient is completed, most of the data in PACS are currently discarded in the archive. Radiologists rely on their experience and education to reach medical decisions. This is a typical problem in medical practice that calls for objective evidence-based medicine. There are many ongoing attempts to structure the text fields of PACS, which include natural language processing of free-text radiological reports, clinical information, and diagnosis. In our approach, we propose to structure the image data, not text fields, to support direct search of images. Namely, physicians will submit an image of a new patient and search past images with similar anatomical phenotypes. Then, the clinical reports of the retrieved data will be compiled for a statistical report of the diagnosis and prognosis. We believe this image structuration is the key to ""unlock the vast amounts of information currently stored"" in PACS and use them for education and modern evidence-based medical decisions.

"Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) is a consortium of centers developing quantitative image features, which are proving to be valuable biomarkers of the underlying cancer biology and that can be used for assessing response to treatment and predicting clinical outcome. It is now important to discover the best quantitative imaging features for detection of response to therapeutics, to identify subtypes of cancer, and to correlate with cancer genomics. However, progress is thwarted by the lack of shared software algorithms, architectures, and resources required to compute, compare, evaluate, and disseminate these quantitative imaging features within the QIN and the broader community. We propose to develop the Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline (QIFP), a cloud-based, open source platform that will give researchers free access to these capabilities and hasten the introduction of quantitative image biomarkers into single- and multi-center clinical trials. The QIFP will facilitate assessment of the incremental value of new vs. existing image feature sets. It will also allow researchers to add their own algorithms to compute novel quantitative image features in their own studies and to disseminate them to the greater research community. To accomplish this: (1) We will create an expandable library of quantitative imaging feature algorithms capable of comprehensive characterization of the imaging phenotype of cancer. It will support a broad set of imaging modalities and algorithms implemented in a variety of languages, including algorithms that provide volumetric and time-varying assessment of lesion size, shape, edge sharpness, and pixel statistics. (2) We will build a cloud-based software architecture for creating, executing, and comparing quantitative image feature-generating pipelines, including algorithms in the library and/or those supplied by QIN or other researchers as plug-ins. QIFP will also have (a) a machine learning engine that lets users specify a dependent variable (e.g., progression-free survival) that the quantitative image features can used to predict, and (b) an evaluation engine that compares the utility of particular features for predicting the dependent variable. (3) We will assess the QIFP in four ways: (a) by its ability to recapitulate the role of known biomarkers in a related clinical trial, (b) by comparing linear measurement, metabolic tumor burden and novel combinations of the features in our library for predicting one-year progression-free survival, (c) by merging imaging features with known host-, drug- and tumor-based follicular lymphoma biomarkers in order to develop the most robust and integrative predictive model for patient outcomes, and (d) by using the QIFP to combine and to evaluate image feature algorithms developed by another QIN team and our own NCI- funded team in the study of radiogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer. The QIFP will fill a substantial gap in the science currently being carried out in the QIN and in the community by providing the tools and infrastructure to assess the value of novel quantitative imaging features of cancer, and will thereby accelerate incorporating new imaging biomarkers into single and multi-center clinical trials and into oncology practice.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop and evaluate a software platform that has major relevance for human health. Many investigators are pursuing image-based surrogates for response to therapy that could be used in clinical trials to predict their success/failure earlier and that are more accurate than existing surrogates. Our developments will facilitate sharing, assessing, and comparing combinations of image feature-generating software algorithms for predicting treatment response, survival, and tissue genomics, which will, in turn, greatly accelerate the development and acceptance of new and more relevant imaging surrogates for assessing cancer treatments.                ","Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers",8960049,U01CA187947,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Pythons', 'RNA Sequences', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Survival', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'cloud based', 'disorder subtype', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vector', 'web based interface']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,652612,0.003032481285780749
"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,8842707,R01HL122484,"['4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'predictive modeling', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2015,758935,0.023958751990153418
"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.        ",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,8968013,K23DK101687,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intestinal Fibrosis', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Steroids', 'Surgical Management', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'improved', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'lecturer', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2015,181860,0.0023885731676756726
"BIGDATA: Small DCM: ESCA DA Computational infrastructure for massive neurosci DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ideally, as neuroscientists collect terabytes of image stacks, the data are automatically processed for open access and analysis. Yet, while several labs around the world are collecting data at unprecedented rates- up to terabytes per day-the computational technologies that facilitate streaming data-intensive computing remain absent. Also deploying data-intensive compute clusters is beyond the means and abilities of most experimental labs. This project will extend, develop, and deploy such technologies. To demonstrate these tools, we will utilize them in support of the ongoing mouse brain architecture (MBA) project, which already has amassed over 0.5 petabytes (PBs) of image data. The main computational challenges posed by these datasets are ones of scale. The tasks that follow remain relatively stereotyped across acquisition modalities. Until now, labs collecting data on this scale have been almost entirely isolated, left to ""reinvent the wheel"" for each of these problems. Moreover, the extant solutions are insufficient for a number of reasons: they often include numerous excel spreadsheets that rely on manual data entry, they lack scalable scientific database backends, and they run on ad hoc clusters not specifically designed for the computational tasks at hand. We aim to augment the current state of the art by implementing the following technological advancements into the MBA project pipeline: (1) Data Management will consist of a unified system that automatically captures metadata, launches processing pipelines, and provides quality control feedback in minutes instead of hours. (2) Data Processing tasks will run algorithms ""out-of-core"", appropriate for their computational requirements, including registration, alignment, and semantic segmentation of cell bodies and processes. (3) Data Storage will automatically build databases for storing multimodal image data and extracted annotations learned from the machine vision algorithms. These databases will be spatially co-registered and stored on an optimized heterogeneous compute cluster. (4) Data Access will be automatically available to everyone-including all the image data and data derived products-via Web-services, including 3D viewing, downloading, and further processing. (5) Data Analytics will extend random graph models suitable for multiscale circuit graphs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Nervous system disorders are responsible for approximately 30% of the total burden of illness in the United States. Whole brain neuroanatomy-available from massive neuroscientific image stacks-is widely believed to be a key missing link in our ability to prevent and treat such illnesses. Thus, this project aims to close this gap via the development and application of BIGDATA tools for management, storage, access, and analytics. n/a",BIGDATA: Small DCM: ESCA DA Computational infrastructure for massive neurosci,8792208,R01DA036400,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Brain', 'Cell physiology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Feedback', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Instruction', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Metadata', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Mus', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Running', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Stereotyping', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'United States', 'Vision', 'burden of illness', 'cluster computing', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized data processing', 'data management', 'design', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal cell body', 'prevent', 'tool', 'web services']",NIDA,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2015,248295,0.012277966397085133
"Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Image evaluation of skeletal muscle biopsies is a procedure essential to research and clinical practice. Although widely used, several major limitations exist with respect to current muscle image morphometric measurement, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, retrieval, and mining procedures: 1) Although traditional morphometric parameters, such as cross-sectional area (CSA) and minimum Feret diameter, etc., serve as critical indicators for assessing muscle function, current measurements are still largely based on manual or semi-automated methods, leading to significant labor costs with large potential inter-observer variability. 2) The current archiving of muscle images is still mainy based on outdated tools such as Excel spreadsheets and computer file folders. Given a new muscle image, it is almost impossible to quickly cross-compare, visualize, query, search, and retrieve previous cases exhibiting similar image contents with comparable morphometric measures, for the purpose of either discovering novel biological co-correlations at benchside, or providing personalized diagnosis and prognosis at bedside. 3) Although a typical muscle image often contains millions of data points (pixels), in clinical practice, doctors often condense this rich information into one or two diagnostic labels and discard the rest. Novel image markers, which are not always apparent through visual inspections or not manually quantifiable, but potentially represent critical diagnostic and prognostic values for precision medicine, have not been rigorously examined. Similarly, in basic science research, only a very limited number of known measures (e.g., CSA) are considered. Some non-traditional measures, such as myofiber shapes that hold the potential to serve as new indicators of muscle functions, are not fully investigated. 4) Current muscle image analysis and searching functions are fairly low throughput. As a frontier research area, Cloud computing can handle big image data in a distributed manner by providing high-throughput computational power. However, its application to muscle images has never been explored. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, bioinformatics image mining, and Cloud computing. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Develop the automated morphometric measurement unit, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) unit, and the image archiving and visualization unit. 2) Develop the advanced bioinformatics image mining unit to assist in the rapid discovery and validation of new image markers. 3) Develop the Cloud computing unit to enable big image data processing and searching functions. Disseminate this freely available, Cloud-enabled imaging informatics system to muscle research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to develop and disseminate an advanced Cloud-enabled imaging informatics tool - MuscleMiner. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, and bioinformatics image mining. The goal of MuscleMiner is to offer a freely available and powerful tool to help all clinician and basic scienc muscle researchers in their daily work. Beyond fast, objective, reproducible, and automated morphometric measurements, the impact of MuscleMiner will be multiplied by laboratories using the CBIR and visualization units (Aim 1), bioinformatics image mining unit (Aim 2), and Cloud-computing unit (Aim 3) to deeply mine and fully utilize the rich information embedded in large collections of muscle images.",Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus,8922953,R01AR065479,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Fascicle', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'frontier', 'image archival system', 'image visualization', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic value', 'skeletal', 'tool', 'wasting']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2015,314327,0.05034654207944446
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.                ",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,8968015,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'skills training', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2015,169609,0.008414334554756042
"In vivo Characterization of Stents using Intravascular OCT Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intravascular stents. Although the technology has advanced and drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent parameters include drug choice, bioresorbable versus metal, mechanical design, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To optimize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical studies. Intravascular OCT (iOCT) alone provides the resolution and contrast s necessary for in vivo interrogation of vascular healing; stent deployment issues such as malposition; and assessment of stent strut tissue coverage. The Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory at CWRU analyzes iOCT images as a service to numerous clinical and preclinical trials from around the world. An analyst takes many hours to analyze manually a single stent, greatly limiting the size and number of studies. Despite training and quality assurance measures, inter-analyst variability limits the ability to determine changes between stent types. We will develop highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibility, increase accuracy, etc. Careful evaluations/validations will be performed using our database of >1500 manually analyzed stents, and new phantom and pig studies. With the successful completion of this research and development, we will deliver well-validated, highly automated software, which will enable routine use of iOCT for sensitive evaluation of emerging stent technologies, thereby providing greatly improved treatments of cardiovascular disease. In addition, fast, robust software will contribute to clinical usage of iOCT for assessment of stent deployment and healing of a stented vessel. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year.

"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional DESCRIPTION: Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory.

"Digital Pathology_Accuracy Viewing Behavior and Image Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 1.4 million women per year depend on pathologists to accurately interpret breast biopsies for a diagnosis of benign disease or cancer. Diagnostic errors are alarmingly frequent and likely lead to altered patient treatment, especially at the thresholds of atypical hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ, where up to 50% of cases are misclassified. The causes underlying these errors remain largely unknown.  Technology similar to Google Maps now allows pan and zoom manipulation of high-resolution digital images of glass microscope slides. This technology has virtually replaced the microscope in medical schools and is rapidly diffusing into U.S. pathology practices. No research has evaluated the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists' interpretion of digital images vs. glass slides. However, these ""digital slides"" offer a novel opportunity to study the accuracy, efficiency, and viewing behavior of a large number of pathologists as they manipulate and interpret images. The innovative analytic techniques proposed in this application are similar to those used to improve the performance of pilots and air traffic controllers. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Digital Image vs. Glass Slides: To compare the interpretive accuracy of pathologists viewing digitized slide images over the Internet to their performance viewing original glass slides under a microscope. A randomized national sample of pathologists (N=200) will interpret 240 test cases in one or both formats in two phases. Measures will include a diagnostic assessment for each test case and for digital slides, cursor- (i.e., mouse) tracking data and region of interest (ROI) markings. Completion of this aim will establish benchmarks for the comparative diagnostic accuracy of whole-slide digital images.  Aim 2. Interpretive Screening Behavior: To identify visual scanning patterns associated with diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Detailed simultaneous eye-tracking and cursor-tracking data will be collected on 60 additional pathologists while they interpret digital slides to complement data from Aim 1. Viewing patterns will be analyzed from computer representations of raw movement data. Videos depicting accurate, efficient visual scanning and cursor movement will be valuable tools in educating the next generation of digital pathologists. Aim 3. Image Analyses: To examine and classify the image characteristics (including color, texture, and structure) of ROIs captured in Aims 1 and 2. Computer-based statistical learning techniques will be used to identify image characteristics that lead to correct and incorrect diagnoses. Characteristics of both diagnostic and distracting ROIs will be identified, linking all three aims. In summary, we will determine whether digitized whole-slide images are diagnostically equivalent to original glass slides. Our in-depth scientific evaluation of viewing patterns and characteristics of ROIs identified by pathologists will be critical to understanding diagnostic errors and sources of distraction. Optimization of viewing techniques will improve diagnostic performance and thus, the quality of clinical care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pathologist errors in the interpretation of biopsy specimens can result in significant harm to patients. Digital imaging technology is rapidly diffusing into medical settings, providing a unique opportunity to obtain data on the process used by pathologists when interpreting slides. The results will provide the foundation needed to improve interpretive accuracy and efficiency, support quality improvement efforts, and ultimately reduce the burden of misdiagnosis on patients and the health care delivery system.",Digital Pathology_Accuracy Viewing Behavior and Image Characterization,8771432,R01CA172343,"['Adoption', 'Air', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Atypical hyperplasia', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Breast biopsy', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Error Sources', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Rural Hospitals', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientific Evaluation', 'Slide', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative', 'computer monitor', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'distraction', 'eye hand coordination', 'health care delivery', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'migration', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transmission process']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,639475,0.011917332823263113
"Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease by imaging the left ventricle (LV) of the heart at rest and then after either exercise or pharmacologically-induce stress to reveal ischemia. However, acquisitions are heavily operator dependent, two-dimensional (2D), and interpretation is generally based on qualitative assessment. While a variety of quantitative 2D approaches have been proposed in the research literature, none have been shown to be superior to the still highly variable qualitative visual comparison of rest/stress echocardiographic image sequences for detecting ischemic disease. Here, we propose that the way forward must focus on a new computational image analysis paradigm for quantitative 4D (three spatial dimensions plus time) stress echocardiography. Our strategy integrates information derived from both radiofrequency (RF) and B-mode echocardiographic images acquired using a matrix array probe. The integrated analysis system will yield accurate and robust measures of strain and strain rate - at rest, stress and differentially between rest and stress - that will identify myocardial tissue at-risk after dobutamine-induced stress. This work wil involve the development of novel (1) phase-sensitive, correlation-based RF ultrasound speckle tracking to estimate mid-wall displacements, (2) ma- chine learning techniques to localize the LV bounding surfaces and their displacements from B-mode data, (3) a meshless integration approach based on radial basis functions (RBFs) and Bayesian reasoning/sparse coding to estimate dense spatiotemporal parameters of strain and strain rate and (4) non-rigid registration of rest and stress image sequences to develop unique, 3D differential deformation parameters. The quantitative approach will be validated with implanted sonomicrometers and microsphere-derived flows using an acute canine model of stenosis. The ability of deformation and differential deformation derived from 4D stress echocardiography to detect new myocardial tissue at-risk in the presence of existing infarction will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic canine model of infarction with superimposed ischemia. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility of our deformation and differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Three main collaborators will team on this work. A group led by Matthew O'Donnell from the University of Washington will develop the RF-based speckle tracking methods. An image analysis group led by the PI James Duncan at Yale University will develop methods for segmentation, shape tracking, dense displacement integration and strain computation. A cardiology/physiology group under Dr. Albert Sinusas at Yale will perform the acute and chronic canine studies and the human stress echo studies. A consultant from Philips Medical Systems will work with the entire team to bridge the ultrasound image acquisition technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The detection and diagnosis of coronary artery disease are commonly performed using stress echocardiography, a test that is performed 3 million times in the United States annually. Our new methods will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation in 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) due to stress using a cost efficient and noninvasive imaging technology. The resulting methodology may lead to more sensitive and accurate detection of stress-induced ischemia that will better guide clinical decision making.",Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography,8807942,R01HL121226,"['Acute', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiology', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diastole', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dobutamine', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Exercise', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Implant', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Radial', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stenosis', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Ventricular', 'Visual', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'elastography', 'in vivo', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'radio frequency', 'radiofrequency', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,767996,0.025305969559448933
"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management. Aim 3) Disseminate software and knowledge, via a) deploying our software to the clinic at Penn as well as to selected collaborating institutions, in order to test and further refine the software accordig to feedback; b) freely distributing our software to the research community; c) organizing various educational activities for both clinicians and informaticians, and setting up and maintaining support forums.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advanced computer analysis methodology for interpretation of radiologic images of cancer, emphasizing brain and breast cancer. The functionality of the software will substantially transcend limitations of current analysis of cancer images, and will open the way for more precise and effective surgical planning as well as for more specific diagnosis of cancer based on its imaging characteristics, eventually leading to individualized medicine.                ",Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer,8967740,U24CA189523,"['Algorithmic Software', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational Activities', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genomics', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'follow-up', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging probe', 'individualized medicine', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'open source', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'web site']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U24,2015,653458,-0.059912351722170284
"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue identification and quantification plays a significant role in the study of aging and age-related diseases. For example, the accumulation of fat in the human body and its regional distribution with aging is associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in muscle composition are strongly linked to decline of muscle strength, decreased mobility caused by aging, or musculoskeletal disorders. Especially interesting is analysis of longitudinal changes of morphometric descriptors that is significant for studying the aging process and for the diagnosis and prevention of age-related diseases.  Medical imaging has emerged as a major tool for estimation of body composition mainly due to being non- invasive and producing multi-dimensional information. Nowadays MRI and CT acquisition is a central component of clinical trials. An abundance of imaging data is collected, but this wealth of information has not been utilized to full extent. Therefore research on image analysis techniques for tissue quantification that are reproducible and can be used on large-scale clinical trials is of particular importance.  The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse body composition data from modern MRI and CT imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who are healthy versus those who are not. The goal of our work is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the abdomen and lower extremities and to study the relationship between body morphological changes and age-related pathologies.  We will build upon recent advances in medical image computing to segment muscle, regional adipose tissue, and bone in clinical CT and MRI scans. We will also develop image registration procedures to achieve intra- and inter-subject correspondence and make efficient use of information provided by multi-modal and multi-temporal imaging data collected in clinical trials (aim 1). After these methods have been developed, we will address the hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging can increase the prognostic accuracy of age-related pathologies (aim2).          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic and affect the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million don't know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function. This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition and its changes with increasing age to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies.                 ",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES,8854343,SC3GM113754,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delaware', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Techniques', 'Thigh structure', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age related', 'biophysical model', 'bone', 'effective therapy', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'sarcopenia', 'statistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY,SC3,2015,63363,0.012645454976479205
"Prediction of IPF Progression Using Imaging Patterns ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. These designations of natural history assume great importance at a time when insights from preclinical studies are beginning to translate into therapies targeted at specific key pathways of fibrosis. Stratification of disease phenotypes is important in order to decipher the effects of newly approved therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individual patients.  Various prognostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with overall survival; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good early predictive models exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF from multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier on scans annotated manually by an expert radiologist, analyzing in separate aims static image features present on baseline scans and transitional (difference) morphologic features on sequential scans that herald progressive disease. Features of anatomic distribution will be explored and reproducible imaging features will be expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score. Aggregate prognostic models using Cox proportional regression models will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Finally, we will externally validate our models in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitia Lung Disease Program.  Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that anticipate disease course in patients with IPF. We anticipate that these models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions for the choice in treatment as well as future research to define more homogeneous cohorts for testing new safe and effective therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rates of progression are highly variable, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using newer drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to predict disease course in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.            ",Prediction of IPF Progression Using Imaging Patterns,8956609,R21HL123477,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Derivation procedure', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hamman-Rich syndrome', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Stable Disease', 'Stratification', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'digital imaging', 'disease classification', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'effective therapy', 'functional decline', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'novel', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'respiratory', 'success', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2015,107290,0.005890320155059118
"Quantitative Image Analysis Techniques for Optic Nerve Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disorders of the optic nerve (ON) account for a significant percentage of the 20 most impactful ophthalmological conditions. Collectively, diseases of the ON are the number one cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, and present serious public health concerns in the U.S. Consider, for example, that glaucoma impacts more than three million Americans and costs the U.S. economy almost $3 billion per year. Optic neuritis (i.e., inflammatory demyelination of the ON) is the initial symptom in ~25% of all multipl sclerosis (MS) cases (which impacts over 400 thousand Americans and introduces societal health care costs of nearly $30 billion per year). Nearly two thirds of MS patients will experience episodes of optic neuritis in their lifetimes, and 40-60% of patients have visual defects localized to the ON. These disorders irreversibly damage the ON. Even so, damage to axons in the ON is progressive, defined by a window of opportunity for treatment between loss of function and actual degeneration. The potential for recovery exists because there are treatments that can help prevent progression if administered during this window of opportunity. Yet, we do not have effective means to assess who is in the window and who will benefit from treatment. We propose to translate computational imaging methods from the neuroimaging community to provide robust, quantitative tools for assessing the optic nerve (ON) on clinical and research imaging sequences. These efforts will improve prognostic accuracy, lead to better understanding of patient responses, and enhance targeted interventions. The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse ON data from modern MRI and CT clinical sequences. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative ON phenotypes on longitudinal clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who respond to treatment versus those who do not.  The overall goal of this research is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the ON and its relationships with pathological disorders. We will build upon recent advances in robust medical image computing to segment the ON in clinical CT and MRI acquisitions, develop registration procedures to establish intra- and inter-subject correspondence, and bring together information from the multi-modal battery of imaging studies that are typically used in clinical care (aim 1). With these new methods, we will address the exploratory hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging data can increase prognostic accuracy (aim 2). We note that aim 2 is particularly exploratory and in line with the high- risk/high-reward aspect of this mechanism; many studies have shown that baseline imaging does not conclusively predict long term outcome or treatment response. We hypothesize that this may be because early findings are related to edema and inflammation rather than cellular damage per se. Once this exploratory phase is complete, we will pursue promising prognostic biomarkers using more detailed condition staging criteria and including more than two longitudinal time points in the analysis. Ultimately, these efforts will improve assessment ON disease and, in turn, patient care.

The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse ON data from modern MRI and CT clinical sequences.

"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,8887334,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2015,591379,0.04660511158591561
"Multimodal image registration by proxy image synthesis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Image registration is a fundamentally important capability in modern neuroscience and clinical medicine. Normalization in functional imaging studies, studies of shape changes in growth, aging, and disease, overlaying surgical plans on intraoperative images, and geometric distortion correction are examples of important applications of image registration. There are dozens of needs for registration in both intrasubject and intersubject applications as well. Therefore, any improvement in image registration performance will have an immediate impact on the scientific and clinical communities. Despite numerous advances in image reconstruction algorithms, the use of multiple modalities (or tissue contrasts) to carry out image registration is a virtually untapped area. The vastly dominant framework is to register a single image of the subject to another single image of the target, and if multiple images are available of either subject or target, they are registered by using the transformation derived from the single image registration. The proposed research will develop, evaluate, and validate a very simply explained but quite radical idea for multi-modal registration. The basic idea is to synthesize a ""proxy"" image from the subject image that has the same tissue contrast and intensity range as the target image and then use a conventional metric such as sum-of-square difference to carry out the registration between the subject proxy and target. Preliminary results demonstrate significant benefits in this approach. In the grant we will: 1) Optimize ""proxy"" multimodal image registration by exploring its theoretical justification as well a key parameters of the overall approach; 2) Apply ""proxy"" multimodal image registration to three key applications in neuroscience in order to validate the method and develop principles of best practice; and 3) Write open source software to carry out image synthesis, similarity computation, and rigid and deformable registration using the ""proxy"" image concept. Both the software to synthesize images for use in a user's favorite image registration method as well as software to carry out the entire ""proxy"" registration process in an optimized way will be made publicly available as open source computer code. The results of this research will lead to a new era in image registration by changing the way researchers and practitioners acquire and use data for neuroscientific studies and clinical medicine.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical image registration is a method used throughout clinical medicine and medical research and it is vital to the success of many treatments and therapies and for answering a myriad of important scientific questions. This research will permit better alignment by devising and testing a new similarity criterion for multimodal images using the first significantly new approach in over a decade. The result will be better alignment of these images, which will enable better clinical diagnosis and prognosis and more significant research discoveries.

"Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the advent of whole slide digital scanners, histopathology slides can be digitized into very high-resolution digital images, realizing a new ""big data"" stream that can potentially rival ""omics data"" in size and complexity. Just as with the analysis of high-throughput genetic and expression data, the application of sophisticated image analytic tools and data pipelines can render the often passive data of digital pathology (DP) archives into a powerful source for: (a) rich quantitative insights into cancer biology and (b) companion diagnostic decision support tools for precision medicine. Digital pathology enabled companion diagnostic tests could yield predictions of cancer risk and aggressiveness in a manner similar to molecular diagnostic tests. However, prior to widespread clinical adoption of DP, extensive evaluation of clinical interpretation of DP imaging (DPI) and accompanying decision support tools needs to be undertaken. Wider acceptance of DPI by the cancer community (clinical and research) is hampered by lack of a publicly available, open access image informatics platform for easily viewing, managing, and quantitatively analyzing DPIs. While some commercial platforms exist for viewing and analyzing DPI data, none of these platforms are freely available. Open source image viewing/management platforms that cater to the radiology (e.g. XNAT) and computational biology communities are typically not conducive to handling very large file sizes as encountered with DPI datasets.  This multi-PI U24 proposal seeks to expand on an existing, freely available pathology image viewer (Sedeen Image Viewer) to create a pathology informatics platform (PIIP) for managing, annotating, sharing, and quantitatively analyzing DPI data. Sedeen was designed as a universal platform for DPI (by addressing several proprietary scanner formats and ""big data"" challenges), to provide (1) reliable and useful image annotation tools, and (2) for image registration and analysis of DPI data. Additionally, Sedeen has become an application for cropping large DPIs so that they can be input into programs such as Matlab or ImageJ. Sedeen has been freely available to the public for three years, with over 160 unique users from over 20 countries.  Building on the initial successes of Sedeen and its existing user base, our intent is to massively increase dissemination of DPI and algorithms in the cancer research community and clinical trial efforts, as well as to contribute towards the adoption of a rational and standardized set of DP operational conventions. This unique project will allow end users with different needs and technical backgrounds to seamlessly (a) archive and manage, (b) share, and (c) visualize their DPI data, acquired from different sites, formats, and platforms. The PIIP will provide a unified user interface for third party algorithms (nuclear segmentation, color normalization, biomarker quantification, radiology-pathology fusion) and will allow for algorithmic evaluation upon data arising from a plurality of source sites. By partnering with professional societies, we envision that the PIIP user base will expand to include the oncology, pathology, radiology, and pharmaceutical communities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will result in the further development of advanced functionality of the already existing digital pathology image informatics platform (PIIP) with an established user-base for cancer research. Such an enhanced platform will provide the much-needed foundation for advancing (a) routine clinical adoption of digital pathology for primary diagnosis and (b) training and validation of companion diagnostic decision support systems based off histopathology. Thus, the project is aligned with the NCI's goal to foster innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving human health.                ","Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management",8970326,U24CA199374,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Community Trial', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Language', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Students', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research site', 'companion diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'high throughput analysis', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'open source', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user friendly software', 'validation studies']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U24,2015,606305,0.021255942993133114
"Intelligent and Automatic Image Segmentation Software for High ThroughputAnalysi     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is well established that aging and many chronic diseases, such as cancer and heart failure, are associated with significant losses in skeletal muscle mass and strength in humans. There is agreement across the muscle biology community that important morphological characteristics of muscle fibers, such as fiber area, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration and fibrosis are critical factors that determine the health and function of the muscle. However, at this time, quantification of muscle characteristics from standard histological and immunohistological techniques is still a manual or, at best, a semi-automatic process. This process is labor intensive and can be prone to errors, leading to high inter-observer variability. On the other hand, when muscle characteristics are calculated by computer-aided image analysis, data acquisition times decrease and objectivity improves significantly. The objective of this Phase I STTR project is to build a fully automatic, intelligent, and high throughput image acquisition and analysis software for quantitative muscle morphological analysis on digitized muscle cross-sections. We propose to utilize the most recent technical advances in machine learning and biomedical image analysis. This includes a newly developed deformable model and mean-shift based seed detection algorithm for better segmentation accuracy; an asymmetric online boosting based machine learning algorithm which allows the software to learn from errors and adjust its segmentation strategies adaptively; and a data parallelization schema using the graphic processing unit (GPU) to handle the computational bottleneck for extremely large scale image, such as whole slide scanned specimens. We believe that this software, equipped with the most advanced technical innovations, will be commercially attractive for the skeletal muscle research community including basic scientists, clinician scientists, and the pharmaceutical industry. The specific aim are: 1) Develop, implement, and validate an automatic biological image analysis software package for skeletal muscle tissue; 2) Develop a novel online updated intelligent artificial intelligence unit to enable the software to learn from errors; 3) Build a novel high performance computing unit to enable fast and high throughput automatic image analysis, which is capable of processing whole slide scanned muscle specimens. The analysis approach proposed will provide more consistent, accurate, and objective quantification of skeletal muscle morphological properties and the time for data analysis will be reduced by over a factor of 100 for standalone version and 2000 for parallel version. The long-term goal of Cytoinformatics, LLC for the Phase II stage is to apply the software to analyze histology/pathology from human muscle biopsy samples and extension of the software to other biological tissues, such as adipose tissue.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Important features of muscle fibers, such as fiber area, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration and fibrosis are critical factors that determine the health of the muscle.

"Automated retinopathy of prematurity classification using machine learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop a web-based, semi-automated system for identifying severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with ""plus disease,"" using an existing data set of retinal images collected from previous NIH-funded research studies. ROP is treatable if diagnosed early, yet continues to be a leading cause of childhood blindness throughout the world. Diagnosis and documentation of ophthalmoscopic findings in ROP are subjective and qualitative, and studies have found that there is often significant diagnostic variation, even when experts are shown the exact same clinical data. Computer-based image analysis and the application of machine learning techniques to feature extraction and image classification have potential to address many of these limitations. Recent advances in image processing have had led to sophisticated techniques for tracing vessel-like structures. Additionally, machine-learning techniques will enable us to leverage these existing annotated image databases to improve the performance of our algorithms for vessel segmentation and disease classification. Our overall hypothesis is that retinal vascular features may be quantified and used to assist clinicians in the diagnosis of ROP. These hypotheses will be tested using two Specific Aims: (1) Develop and evaluate semi-automated algorithms to segment retinal vessels and generate a set of retinal vessel-based features. (2) Develop computer-based decision support algorithms that best correlate with expert opinions. Overall, this project will build upon infrastructure developed from previous studies, create potential for improving the accuracy and consistency of clinical ROP diagnosis, provide a demonstration of computer-based decision support from image analysis during real-world medical care, and stimulate future research toward understanding the vascular features associated with severe ROP. This project will be performed by a multi-disciplinary team of investigators with expertise in ophthalmology, biomedical informatics, computer science, machine learning, and image processing.

"Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopes to image cells or other biological samples. Even for small-scale experiments, the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex, and automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye.  We will continue our development of CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org) to meet this strong and growing demand for software to analyze biological images. CellProfiler is a versatile, open-source toolbox. Using its point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized workflow of image-analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. It can extract valuable biological information from images quickly, even for high-throughput experiments, while increasing objectivity and statistical power in microscopy experiments.  Published only seven years ago, CellProfiler is already an important and widely used tool: it is launched 100,000+ times per year by users around the world and has been cited in more than 800 papers from 600 distinct laboratories. The software evolves in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  We propose to improve CellProfiler's capabilities in order to enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler:  First, microscopy experiments are rapidly expanding in both scale and scope, and are beginning to push CellProfiler's limits, particularly when they involve larger images (e.g., for tissue samples, cellular microarrays, large field-of-view cameras), multi-dimensional images (time-lapse and three-dimensional imaging), images for morphological profiling, and novel microscopy types (super-resolution and single-molecule imaging). We will upgrade CellProfiler's capabilities to serve these needs and add proven, state-of-the-art algorithms for image processing (especially segmentation and filtering for non-fluorescence images), time-lapse and 3D analysis, and novel microscopy types. We will also add features and usability improvements requested by the large CellProfiler community.  Second, we will enable researchers to create sophisticated bioimaging analysis workflows by expanding CellProfiler's interoperability with complementary software (e.g., MATLAB, ImageJ, MicroManager, KNIME).  Third, we will disseminate CellProfiler and provide user, educator, and developer support. There is great demand for our online forum, downloadable materials, and in-person tutorials (1,000+ attendees so far).  These improvements to the first, and still preeminent, open-source software for modular, high- throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from microscopy images across all disciplines within biology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our popular, user-friendly, open-source image analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org), to accommodate the increasing scale and scope of modern microscopy experiments.            ",Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software,8761195,R01GM089652,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Movement', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Slide', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cellular imaging', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2014,522488,0.05363640144981404
"Image analysis for high-throughput C. elegans infection and metabolism assays    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput screening (HTS) is a technique for searching large libraries of chemical or genetic perturbants, to find new treatments for a disease or to better understand disease pathways. As automated image analysis for cultured cells has improved, microscopy has emerged as one of the most powerful and informative ways to analyze screening samples. However, many diseases and biological pathways can be better studied in whole animals-particularly diseases that involve organ systems and multicellular interactions, such as metabolism and infection. The worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established and effective model organism, used by thousands of researchers worldwide to study complex biological processes. Samples of C. elegans can be robotically prepared and imaged by high-throughput microscopy, but existing image-analysis methods are insuf- ficient for most assays. In this project, image-analysis algorithms that are capable of scoring high-throughput assays of C. elegans will be developed.  The algorithms will be tested and refined in three high-throughput screens, which will uncover chemical and genetic regulators of fat metabolism and infection: (1) A C. elegans viability assay to identify modulators of infection. The proposed algorithms use a probabilistic shape model of C. elegans in order to identify and mea- sure individual worms even when the animals touch or cross. These methods are the basis for quantifying many other phenotypes, including body morphology and subtle variations in reporter signal levels. (2) A C. elegans lipid assay to identify genes that regulate fat metabolism. The algorithms proposed for illumination correction, level-set-based foreground segmentation, well-edge detection, and artifact removal will result in improved or- business in high-throughput experiments. (3) A fluorescence gene expression assay to identify regulators of the response of the C. elegans host to Staphylococcus aureus infection. The proposed techniques for constructing anatomical maps of C. elegans will make it possible to quantify a variety of changes in fluorescent localization patterns in a biologically relevant way.  In addition to discovering new metabolism- and infection-related drugs and genetic regulators through these specific screens, this work will provide the C. elegans community with (a) a new framework for extracting mor- phological features from C. elegans for quantitative analysis of this organism, and (b) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms enabling the discovery of genetic pathways, chemical probes, and drug can- didates in whole organism high-throughput screens relevant to a variety of diseases.  This work is a close collaboration with C. elegans experts Fred Ausubel and Gary Ruvkun at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, with Polina Golland and Tammy Riklin-Raviv, experts in model-based segmentation and statistical image analysis at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and with Anne Carpenter, developer of open-source image analysis software at the Broad Institute.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large-scale screening experiments that test the effects of thousands of chemicals or genetic perturbants by microscopy and image analysis can discover new treatments and help biomedical scientists understand dis- ease mechanisms. Microscopy screens of cultured cells are routine, but researchers wish to study complex processes like metabolism and infection in a whole animal like the tiny worm Caenorhabditis elegans, for which existing image analysis methods are insufficient. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to automatically identify and measure C. elegans in microscopy images, thereby making it possible for researchers worldwide to screen a wide variety of complex biological processes related to human disease.

"ENTROPY-BASED TISSUE DISCRIMINATORS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major problem addressed in this proposal is the development and evaluation of an automated noninvasive approach to discriminate different normal and pathological tissue types using machine learning algorithms; previous applications of machine learning have been based on features of the backscattered ultrasound that are essentially energy based. Our approach will be based on extracting features from images whose pixels are determined by the entropy contained in segments of the backscattered ultrasound. The unique attributes of entropy imaging suggest that the automated analysis we propose would be particularly robust for discrimination of deep tissues in a clinical environment.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: All skilled clinical practitioners and interpreters of ultrasound studies realize that much information exists in recorded US images that is processed immediately by the visual cortex and is useful for qualitatively defining pathology, yet defies ready quantification by any robust algorithm. Traditional energy-based representations display grayscale intensities and speckle patterns that have been mapped parametrically into various tissue classification schemes that have yet to demonstrate organ or tissue specificity, although progress has been reported in distinguishing pathologies over the last 30 years. However, the fact that US signal processing and representation of backscatter data in terms of energy functions has not changed over the last 50 years suggests that alternative signal processing schemes may be indicated to represent the richness of the information contained within the backscattered data. To meet this challenge, we have been involved over the past 10 years in processing backscattered RF to create ""information"" images and in designing ""information sensitive"" approaches to classifying the data sets based on statistical analysis of these images These novel and user independent metrics utilize the entropy of windowed segments of radiofrequency (RF) backscatter signal from tis- sue, which represents a radical departure from grayscale or speckle metrics.

"Graph-Based Medical Image Segmentation in 3D and 4D     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive continuation of our Phase-II project. After successfully fulfilling all of its aims, our framework for optimal multi-surface andor multi-object n-D biomedical image segmentation was further extended, validated, and its practical utility demonstrated in clinical and translational image analysis tasks. This Phase-III proposal will develop several important extensions addressing identified limitations of the current framework and specifically focusing on applicability of the methodology to translational and routine healthcare tasks. Novel methods will be developed for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions and surfaces, automated design of cost functions from segmentation examples, and overcoming failures of automated techniques in routine diagnostic quality images by allowing limited and highly efficient expert input to guide the image segmentation processes.  We hypothesize that advanced graph-based image segmentation algorithms merging machine- learning-derived segmentation parameters and image-specific expert guidance will significantly increase quantitative analysis performance in routinely acquired complex diagnostic-quality medical images across diverse application areas. We propose to: 1) Develop 3D, 4D, and generally n-D approaches for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions (objects) and surfaces. 2) Develop methods for data-driven automated design of cost functions used for surface-based, region-based, and surface-and-region-based graph search image segmentation. 3) Develop ""Just-Enough-Interaction"" (JEI) approaches for efficient ""real-time"" medical image segmentation, thus achieving robust clinical applicability of quantitative medical image analysis. 4) Assess performance of all developed methods in translational research settings; determine performance in quantitative medical image analysis and radiation oncology treatment planning workflow. As a result, our project will enable routine quantification and therefore personalized care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Phases I and II of this research project multi-surface and/or multi-object n-D biomedical image segmentation and demonstrated its practical utility.

"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale. Clinical applications include the quantification of angiogenesis in tumors and tissue implants, and the quantification of neurovascular effects in neurodegenerative disease models.",Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular,8916335,R00LM011390,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Simulate', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'memory process', 'mouse model', 'neuronal cell body', 'next generation', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor growth']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R00,2014,246867,0.005405690148939243
"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that advances machine learning algorithms for automatic segmentation and couples these techniques to a scalable tool suite for multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate results.",SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID,8653848,R01NS075314,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computers and Advanced Instrumentation', 'Couples', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Online Systems', 'Organelles', 'Participant', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'biological systems', 'cellular imaging', 'complex biological systems', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'electron optics', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'tomography', 'tool', 'web interface']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2014,436094,0.010536754181324052
"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.                ",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,8652462,R01EY023279,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Papilledema', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability burden', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'public health relevance']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2014,332955,0.006006276861475071
"BIGDATA Small Project Structurization and Direct Search of Medical Image Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): IBM estimates that 30% of the entire data in the world is medical information. Medical images occupy a significant portion of medical records with approximately 100 million scans in US and growing every year. In addition, the data size from each scan steadfastly increases as the image resolution improves. These BigData are not structured and due to lack of standardized imaging protocols, they are highly heterogeneous with different spatial resolutions, contrasts, slice orientations, etc. In this project, we will deelop a technology to structure and search medical imaging information, which will make the past data available for education and evidence-based clinical decision-making. In this grant, we will focus on brain MRI, which comprises the largest portion of MRI data. The target community will be physicians who make decisions and the patients will be the ultimate beneficiaries. Currently, radiological image data are stored in clinical database called PACS. The image data in PACS are not structured. Consequently, once the diagnosis of a patient is completed, most of the data in PACS are currently discarded in the archive. Radiologists rely on their experience and education to reach medical decisions. This is a typical problem in medical practice that calls for objective evidence-based medicine. There are many ongoing attempts to structure the text fields of PACS, which include natural language processing of free-text radiological reports, clinical information, and diagnosis. In our approach, we propose to structure the image data, not text fields, to support direct search of images. Namely, physicians will submit an image of a new patient and search past images with similar anatomical phenotypes. Then, the clinical reports of the retrieved data will be compiled for a statistical report of the diagnosis and prognosis. We believe this image structuration is the key to ""unlock the vast amounts of information currently stored"" in PACS and use them for education and modern evidence-based medical decisions.

"Cloud-computer-aided diagnostic imaging decision support system     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-performance cloud computing (HPCC) is an integration of high-performance computing (HPC) with cloud computing that provides an alternative informatics infrastructure to deliver the supercomputer power needed for developing and reading high quality, multidimensional diagnostic images on desktop or mobile devices. Such infrastructure would advance the use of high-throughput cancer screening like virtual colonoscopy (VC), also known as computed tomography colonography (CTC). The goals of this proposal are to develop and validate the clinical benefits of a mobile HPCC-Virtual Colonoscopy decision support system (HPCC-VC) that integrates novel high-performance electronic cleansing and computer-aided detection schemes. The combination of high performance electronic cleansing (hpEC) with high performance computer aided detection (hpCAD) will allow visualization of the entire mucosal surface of the colon without artifact. Specifically, we hypothesize that the mobile HPCC-VC system will improve the quality of electronic cleansing of non-cathartic CTC (ncCTC) images, will deliver images 100 times faster than conventional approaches, and will improve reader performance in the detection of colonic lesions in the images analyzed on mobile high-resolution display devices.  To achieve these goals, an HPCC platform will be established by use of a CPU-cluster-based supercomputing and parallel image processing libraries. Then, an hpEC scheme will be developed that effectively removes the residual fecal materials in ncCTC images. In parallel, a high-resolution hpCAD scheme will be developed to support high-performance detection of colonic lesions in ncCTC. These schemes will be integrated into a mobile HPCC-VC system on the HPCC platform. Necessary preliminary studies in the development of computed EC and CAD schemes show promise; and the development and deployment of the HPCC platform will advance the quality, speed, and utility of high performance, multidimensional imaging for colon cancer screening. A comprehensive reader performance study will be conducted to determine the clinical application and benefit of images analyzed and delivered through an HPCC platform.  Successful development of HPCC-VC will demonstrate the clinical benefit of the platform for improved diagnostic imaging and facilitation of accurate, high-throughput colon cancer screening that is highly acceptable to patients. In the longer term, broad adoption and use of the HPCC-VC system will facilitate early and accurate diagnoses, and thus reduce mortality from colon cancer.          Successful development of the HPCC-VC system will demonstrate the clinical benefit of HPCC platform for diagnostic imaging, and will provide a high-throughput colon cancer screening scheme for colorectal lesions that is highly acceptable to patients and highly accurate. Such a system will promote the early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reduce the mortality due to colon cancer.

"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.            ",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,8674683,R01HL122484,"['4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2014,782871,0.023958751990153418
"BIGDATA: Small DCM: ESCA DA Computational infrastructure for massive neurosci     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ideally, as neuroscientists collect terabytes of image stacks, the data are automatically processed for open access and analysis. Yet, while several labs around the world are collecting data at unprecedented rates- up to terabytes per day-the computational technologies that facilitate streaming data-intensive computing remain absent. Also deploying data-intensive compute clusters is beyond the means and abilities of most experimental labs. This project will extend, develop, and deploy such technologies. To demonstrate these tools, we will utilize them in support of the ongoing mouse brain architecture (MBA) project, which already has amassed over 0.5 petabytes (PBs) of image data. The main computational challenges posed by these datasets are ones of scale. The tasks that follow remain relatively stereotyped across acquisition modalities. Until now, labs collecting data on this scale have been almost entirely isolated, left to ""reinvent the wheel"" for each of these problems. Moreover, the extant solutions are insufficient for a number of reasons: they often include numerous excel spreadsheets that rely on manual data entry, they lack scalable scientific database backends, and they run on ad hoc clusters not specifically designed for the computational tasks at hand. We aim to augment the current state of the art by implementing the following technological advancements into the MBA project pipeline: (1) Data Management will consist of a unified system that automatically captures metadata, launches processing pipelines, and provides quality control feedback in minutes instead of hours. (2) Data Processing tasks will run algorithms ""out-of-core"", appropriate for their computational requirements, including registration, alignment, and semantic segmentation of cell bodies and processes. (3) Data Storage will automatically build databases for storing multimodal image data and extracted annotations learned from the machine vision algorithms. These databases will be spatially co-registered and stored on an optimized heterogeneous compute cluster. (4) Data Access will be automatically available to everyone-including all the image data and data derived products-via Web-services, including 3D viewing, downloading, and further processing. (5) Data Analytics will extend random graph models suitable for multiscale circuit graphs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Nervous system disorders are responsible for approximately 30% of the total burden of illness in the United States. Whole brain neuroanatomy-available from massive neuroscientific image stacks-is widely believed to be a key missing link in our ability to prevent and treat such illnesses.

"Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Image evaluation of skeletal muscle biopsies is a procedure essential to research and clinical practice. Although widely used, several major limitations exist with respect to current muscle image morphometric measurement, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, retrieval, and mining procedures: 1) Although traditional morphometric parameters, such as cross-sectional area (CSA) and minimum Feret diameter, etc., serve as critical indicators for assessing muscle function, current measurements are still largely based on manual or semi-automated methods, leading to significant labor costs with large potential inter-observer variability. 2) The current archiving of muscle images is still mainy based on outdated tools such as Excel spreadsheets and computer file folders. Given a new muscle image, it is almost impossible to quickly cross-compare, visualize, query, search, and retrieve previous cases exhibiting similar image contents with comparable morphometric measures, for the purpose of either discovering novel biological co-correlations at benchside, or providing personalized diagnosis and prognosis at bedside. 3) Although a typical muscle image often contains millions of data points (pixels), in clinical practice, doctors often condense this rich information into one or two diagnostic labels and discard the rest. Novel image markers, which are not always apparent through visual inspections or not manually quantifiable, but potentially represent critical diagnostic and prognostic values for precision medicine, have not been rigorously examined. Similarly, in basic science research, only a very limited number of known measures (e.g., CSA) are considered. Some non-traditional measures, such as myofiber shapes that hold the potential to serve as new indicators of muscle functions, are not fully investigated. 4) Current muscle image analysis and searching functions are fairly low throughput. As a frontier research area, Cloud computing can handle big image data in a distributed manner by providing high-throughput computational power. However, its application to muscle images has never been explored. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, bioinformatics image mining, and Cloud computing. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Develop the automated morphometric measurement unit, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) unit, and the image archiving and visualization unit. 2) Develop the advanced bioinformatics image mining unit to assist in the rapid discovery and validation of new image markers. 3) Develop the Cloud computing unit to enable big image data processing and searching functions. Disseminate this freely available, Cloud-enabled imaging informatics system to muscle research community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to develop and disseminate an advanced Cloud-enabled imaging informatics tool - MuscleMiner. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, and bioinformatics image mining. The goal of MuscleMiner is to offer a freely available and powerful tool to help all clinician and basic scienc muscle researchers in their daily work. Beyond fast, objective, reproducible, and automated morphometric measurements, the impact of MuscleMiner will be multiplied by laboratories using the CBIR and visualization units (Aim 1), bioinformatics image mining unit (Aim 2), and Cloud-computing unit (Aim 3) to deeply mine and fully utilize the rich information embedded in large collections of muscle images.            ",Development and Dissemination of MuscleMiner: An Imaging Informatics Tool for Mus,8761698,R01AR065479,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Fascicle', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'frontier', 'image archival system', 'image visualization', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'skeletal', 'tool', 'wasting']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2014,314327,0.05034654207944446
"In-field FAST Procedure Support and Automation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) procedure is an ultrasound examination performed to identify intra-peritoneal hemorrhage or pericardial tamponade. FAST involves the detection of free fluid in ultrasound images from four specific abdominal areas. Unstable patients with positive FAST results are operated on, and stable patients with negative results tend to be observed.  We propose to develop the hardware and image analysis algorithms necessary for novice ultrasound operators to perform life-saving FAST procedures. The proposed system will consist of a low-cost ultrasound probe, connected to a ruggedize tablet computer, running innovative computer vision algorithms, embedded in an intuitive application. Using that system, a novice operator will be visually guided to acquire ultrasound images from the abdominal locations and quantify the free fluid in those images.  The target for our initial deployment of the system is level 3 and 4 trauma centers. These centers must often serve areas spanning hundreds and even thousands of miles; however, they are typically under-staffed and under-equipped.  The proposal is being clinically driven by Jeffrey Lowell, MD. He is a USNR Trauma Surgeon, and he was recently deployed to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, the only Level I Trauma Center outside the U.S.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) procedure is an ultrasound-based examination for rapidly detecting blood in the abdomen, particularly after blunt abdominal trauma, which is common, for example, with car accidents. The challenge is that the FAST procedure requires expertise and equipment which is not commonly available at level 3 and 4 trauma centers that serve rural populations. We propose to develop the hardware and image analysis algorithms necessary for novice ultrasound operators to perform life- saving FAST procedures. The proposed system will consist of a low-cost, hand-held ultrasound probe, connected to a ruggedize tablet computer, running innovative computer vision algorithms, embedded in an easy-to-follow software application.            ",In-field FAST Procedure Support and Automation,8652454,R43EB016621,"['Abdomen', 'Abdominal Injuries', 'Accidents', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Blood', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Funding', 'Hand', 'Hemoperitoneum', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Operating Rooms', 'Organ Harvestings', 'Organ Procurements', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pelvis', 'Pericardial body location', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transplant Surgeon', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncompensated Care', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'emergency service responder', 'experience', 'follower of religion Jewish', 'health disparity', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'trauma centers']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R43,2014,195709,0.017179876047929983
"In vivo Characterization of Stents using Intravascular OCT Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intravascular stents. Although the technology has advanced and drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent parameters include drug choice, bioresorbable versus metal, mechanical design, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To optimize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical studies. Intravascular OCT (iOCT) alone provides the resolution and contrast s necessary for in vivo interrogation of vascular healing; stent deployment issues such as malposition; and assessment of stent strut tissue coverage. The Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory at CWRU analyzes iOCT images as a service to numerous clinical and preclinical trials from around the world. An analyst takes many hours to analyze manually a single stent, greatly limiting the size and number of studies. Despite training and quality assurance measures, inter-analyst variability limits the ability to determine changes between stent types. We will develop highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibility, increase accuracy, etc. Careful evaluations/validations will be performed using our database of >1500 manually analyzed stents, and new phantom and pig studies. With the successful completion of this research and development, we will deliver well-validated, highly automated software, which will enable routine use of iOCT for sensitive evaluation of emerging stent technologies, thereby providing greatly improved treatments of cardiovascular disease. In addition, fast, robust software will contribute to clinical usage of iOCT for assessment of stent deployment and healing of a stented vessel.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year.

"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional     DESCRIPTION: Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of statistical frameworks and methods for the analysis of complex ultra-high-dimensional biomedical imaging.

"Digital Pathology_Accuracy Viewing Behavior and Image Characterization     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 1.4 million women per year depend on pathologists to accurately interpret breast biopsies for a diagnosis of benign disease or cancer. Diagnostic errors are alarmingly frequent and likely lead to altered patient treatment, especially at the thresholds of atypical hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ, where up to 50% of cases are misclassified. The causes underlying these errors remain largely unknown.  Technology similar to Google Maps now allows pan and zoom manipulation of high-resolution digital images of glass microscope slides. This technology has virtually replaced the microscope in medical schools and is rapidly diffusing into U.S. pathology practices. No research has evaluated the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists' interpretion of digital images vs. glass slides. However, these ""digital slides"" offer a novel opportunity to study the accuracy, efficiency, and viewing behavior of a large number of pathologists as they manipulate and interpret images. The innovative analytic techniques proposed in this application are similar to those used to improve the performance of pilots and air traffic controllers. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Digital Image vs. Glass Slides: To compare the interpretive accuracy of pathologists viewing digitized slide images over the Internet to their performance viewing original glass slides under a microscope. A randomized national sample of pathologists (N=200) will interpret 240 test cases in one or both formats in two phases. Measures will include a diagnostic assessment for each test case and for digital slides, cursor- (i.e., mouse) tracking data and region of interest (ROI) markings. Completion of this aim will establish benchmarks for the comparative diagnostic accuracy of whole-slide digital images.  Aim 2. Interpretive Screening Behavior: To identify visual scanning patterns associated with diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Detailed simultaneous eye-tracking and cursor-tracking data will be collected on 60 additional pathologists while they interpret digital slides to complement data from Aim 1. Viewing patterns will be analyzed from computer representations of raw movement data. Videos depicting accurate, efficient visual scanning and cursor movement will be valuable tools in educating the next generation of digital pathologists. Aim 3. Image Analyses: To examine and classify the image characteristics (including color, texture, and structure) of ROIs captured in Aims 1 and 2. Computer-based statistical learning techniques will be used to identify image characteristics that lead to correct and incorrect diagnoses. Characteristics of both diagnostic and distracting ROIs will be identified, linking all three aims. In summary, we will determine whether digitized whole-slide images are diagnostically equivalent to original glass slides. Our in-depth scientific evaluation of viewing patterns and characteristics of ROIs identified by pathologists will be critical to understanding diagnostic errors and sources of distraction. Optimization of viewing techniques will improve diagnostic performance and thus, the quality of clinical care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pathologist errors in the interpretation of biopsy specimens can result in significant harm to patients. Digital imaging technology is rapidly diffusing into medical settings, providing a unique opportunity to obtain data on the process used by pathologists when interpreting slides. The results will provide the foundation needed to improve interpretive accuracy and efficiency, support quality improvement efforts, and ultimately reduce the burden of misdiagnosis on patients and the health care delivery system.            ",Digital Pathology_Accuracy Viewing Behavior and Image Characterization,8601692,R01CA172343,"['Adoption', 'Air', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Atypical hyperplasia', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Breast', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Error Sources', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Rural Hospitals', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientific Evaluation', 'Slide', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative', 'computer monitor', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'distraction', 'eye hand coordination', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'migration', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transmission process']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,623127,0.011917332823263113
"Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography  Project Summary/Abstract  Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease by imaging the left ventricle (LV) of the heart at rest and then after either exercise or pharmacologically-induced stress to reveal ischemia. However, acquisitions are heavily operator dependent, two-dimensional (2D), and interpretation is generally based on qualitative assessment. While a variety of quan- titative 2D approaches have been proposed in the research literature, none have been shown to be superior to the still highly variable qualitative visual comparison of rest/stress echocardiographic image sequences for detecting ischemic disease. Here, we propose that the way forward must focus on a new computational im- age analysis paradigm for quantitative 4D (three spatial dimensions plus time) stress echocardiography. Our strategy integrates information derived from both radiofrequency (RF) and B-mode echocardiographic images acquired using a matrix array probe. The integrated analysis system will yield accurate and robust measures of strain and strain rate - at rest, stress and differentiallly between rest and stress - that will identify my- ocardial tissue at-risk after dobutamine-induced stress. This work will involve the development of novel (1) phase-sensitive, correlation-based RF ultrasound speckle tracking to estimate mid-wall displacements, (2) ma- chine learning techniques to localize the LV bounding surfaces and their displacements from B-mode data, (3) a meshless integration approach based on radial basis functions (RBFs) and Bayesian reasoning/sparse coding to estimate dense spatiotemporal parameters of strain and strain rate and (4) non-rigid registration of rest and stress image sequences to develop unique, 3D differential deformation parameters. The quantitative approach will be validated with implanted sonomicrometers and microsphere-derived flows using an acute canine model of stenosis. The ability of deformation and differential deformation derived from 4D stress echocardiography to detect new myocardial tissue at-risk in the presence of existing infarction will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic canine model of infarction with superimposed ischemia. The technique will be translated to hu- mans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility of our deformation and differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Three main collaborators will team on this work. A group led by Matthew O'Donnell from the University of Washington will develop the RF-based speckle tracking methods. An image analysis group led by the PI James Duncan at Yale University will develop methods for segmentation, shape tracking, dense displacement integration and strain computation. A cardiology/physiology group under Dr. Albert Sinusas at Yale will perform the acute and chronic canine studies and the human stress echo studies. A consultant from Philips Medical Systems will work with the entire team to bridge the ultrasound image acquisition technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The detection and diagnosis of coronary artery disease are commonly performed using stress echocardiography, a test that is performed 3 million times in the United States annually. Our new methods will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation in 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) due to stress using a cost efficient and noninvasive imaging technology. The resulting methodology may lead to more sensitive and accurate detection of stress-induced ischemia that will better guide clinical decision making.            ",Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography,8614454,R01HL121226,"['Acute', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiology', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diastole', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dobutamine', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Exercise', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Frequencies', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Implant', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Radial', 'Radio', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stenosis', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Ventricular', 'Visual', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'elastography', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'radiofrequency', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,819740,0.0220262449922008
"Quantitative Image Analysis Techniques for Optic Nerve Disease  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Disorders of the optic nerve (ON) account for a significant percentage of the 20 most impactful ophthalmological conditions. Collectively, diseases of the ON are the number one cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, and present serious public health concerns in the U.S. Consider, for example, that glaucoma impacts more than three million Ameri- cans and costs the U.S. economy almost $3 billion per year. Optic neuritis (i.e., inflammatory demyelination of the ON) is the initial symptom in ~25% of all multiple sclerosis (MS) cases (which impacts over 400 thousand Americans and intro- duces societal health care costs of nearly $30 billion per year). Nearly two thirds of MS patients will experience episodes of optic neuritis in their lifetimes, and 40-60% of patients have visual defects localized to the ON. These disorders irre- versibly damage the ON. Even so, damage to axons in the ON is progressive, defined by a window of opportunity for treatment between loss of function and actual degeneration. The potential for recovery exists because there are treatments that can help prevent progression if administered during this window of opportunity. Yet, we do not have effective means to assess who is in the window and who will benefit from treatment.  We propose to translate computational imaging methods from the neuroimaging community to provide ro- bust, quantitative tools for assessing the optic nerve (ON) on clinical and research imaging sequences. These efforts will improve prognostic accuracy, lead to better understanding of patient responses, and enhance targeted interven- tions. The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse ON data from modern MRI and CT clinical sequences. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative ON phenotypes on longitudinal clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who respond to treatment versus those who do not.  The overall goal of this research is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the ON and its relationships with pathological disorders. We will build upon recent advances in robust medical image computing to segment the ON in clinical CT and MRI acquisitions, develop registration procedures to establish intra- and inter-subject correspondence, and bring together information from the multi-modal battery of imaging studies that are typically used in clinical care (aim 1). With these new methods, we will address the exploratory hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging data can increase prognostic accuracy (aim 2). We note that aim 2 is particularly exploratory and in line with the high- risk/high-reward aspect of this mechanism; many studies have shown that baseline imaging does not conclusively pre- dict long term outcome or treatment response. We hypothesize that this may be because early findings are related to edema and inflammation rather than cellular damage per se. Once this exploratory phase is complete, we will pursue promising prognostic biomarkers using more detailed condition staging criteria and including more than two longitudinal time points in the analysis. Ultimately, these efforts will improve assessment ON disease and, in turn, patient care.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.        Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project will combine attributes of advanced ultrasound and magnetic-resonance techniques and embody them in a prototype imaging system capable of generating novel tissue-type images that reliably depict PCa in real-time.

"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,8761531,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Build-it', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'research study', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2014,611476,0.04660511158591561
"Multimodal image registration by proxy image synthesis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Image registration is a fundamentally important capability in modern neuroscience and clinical medicine. Normalization in functional imaging studies, studies of shape changes in growth, aging, and disease, overlaying surgical plans on intraoperative images, and geometric distortion correction are examples of important applications of image registration. There are dozens of needs for registration in both intrasubject and intersubject applications as well. Therefore, any improvement in image registration performance will have an immediate impact on the scientific and clinical communities. Despite numerous advances in image reconstruction algorithms, the use of multiple modalities (or tissue contrasts) to carry out image registration is a virtually untapped area. The vastly dominant framework is to register a single image of the subject to another single image of the target, and if multiple images are available of either subject or target, they are registered by using the transformation derived from the single image registration. The proposed research will develop, evaluate, and validate a very simply explained but quite radical idea for multi-modal registration. The basic idea is to synthesize a ""proxy"" image from the subject image that has the same tissue contrast and intensity range as the target image and then use a conventional metric such as sum-of-square difference to carry out the registration between the subject proxy and target. Preliminary results demonstrate significant benefits in this approach. In the grant we will: 1) Optimize ""proxy"" multimodal image registration by exploring its theoretical justification as well a key parameters of the overall approach; 2) Apply ""proxy"" multimodal image registration to three key applications in neuroscience in order to validate the method and develop principles of best practice; and 3) Write open source software to carry out image synthesis, similarity computation, and rigid and deformable registration using the ""proxy"" image concept. Both the software to synthesize images for use in a user's favorite image registration method as well as software to carry out the entire ""proxy"" registration process in an optimized way will be made publicly available as open source computer code. The results of this research will lead to a new era in image registration by changing the way researchers and practitioners acquire and use data for neuroscientific studies and clinical medicine.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical image registration is a method used throughout clinical medicine and medical research and it is vital to the success of many treatments and therapies and for answering a myriad of important scientific questions. This research will permit better alignment by devising and testing a new similarity criterion for multimodal images using the first significantly new approach in over a decade. The result will be better alignment of these images, which will enable better clinical diagnosis and prognosis and more significant research discoveries.

"Intelligent and Automatic Image Segmentation Software for High ThroughputAnalysi     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is well established that aging and many chronic diseases, such as cancer and heart failure, are associated with significant losses in skeletal muscle mass and strength in humans. There is agreement across the muscle biology community that important morphological characteristics of muscle fibers, such as fiber area, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration and fibrosis are critical factors that determine the health and function of the muscle. However, at this time, quantification of muscle characteristics from standard histological and immunohistological techniques is still a manual or, at best, a semi-automatic process. This process is labor intensive and can be prone to errors, leading to high inter-observer variability. On the other hand, when muscle characteristics are calculated by computer-aided image analysis, data acquisition times decrease and objectivity improves significantly. The objective of this Phase I STTR project is to build a fully automatic, intelligent, and high throughput image acquisition and analysis software for quantitative muscle morphological analysis on digitized muscle cross-sections. We propose to utilize the most recent technical advances in machine learning and biomedical image analysis. This includes a newly developed deformable model and mean-shift based seed detection algorithm for better segmentation accuracy; an asymmetric online boosting based machine learning algorithm which allows the software to learn from errors and adjust its segmentation strategies adaptively; and a data parallelization schema using the graphic processing unit (GPU) to handle the computational bottleneck for extremely large scale image, such as whole slide scanned specimens. We believe that this software, equipped with the most advanced technical innovations, will be commercially attractive for the skeletal muscle research community including basic scientists, clinician scientists, and the pharmaceutical industry. The specific aim are: 1) Develop, implement, and validate an automatic biological image analysis software package for skeletal muscle tissue; 2) Develop a novel online updated intelligent artificial intelligence unit to enable the software to learn from errors; 3) Build a novel high performance computing unit to enable fast and high throughput automatic image analysis, which is capable of processing whole slide scanned muscle specimens. The analysis approach proposed will provide more consistent, accurate, and objective quantification of skeletal muscle morphological properties and the time for data analysis will be reduced by over a factor of 100 for standalone version and 2000 for parallel version. The long-term goal of Cytoinformatics, LLC for the Phase II stage is to apply the software to analyze histology/pathology from human muscle biopsy samples and extension of the software to other biological tissues, such as adipose tissue.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Important features of muscle fibers, such as fiber area, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration and fibrosis are critical factors that determine the health of the muscle.

"Automated retinopathy of prematurity classification using machine learning  Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to develop a web-based, semi-automated system for identifying severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with ""plus disease,"" using an existing data set of retinal images collected from previous NIH- funded research studies. ROP is treatable if diagnosed early, yet continues to be a leading cause of childhood blindness throughout the world. Diagnosis and documentation of ophthalmoscopic findings in ROP are subjective and qualitative, and studies have found that there is often significant diagnostic variation, even when experts are shown the exact same clinical data. Computer-based image analysis and the application of machine learning techniques to feature extraction and image classification have potential to address many of these limitations. Recent advances in image processing have had led to sophisticated techniques for tracing vessel-like structures. Additionally, machine-learning techniques will enable us to leverage these existing annotated image databases to improve the performance of our algorithms for vessel segmentation and disease classification. Our overall hypothesis is that retinal vascular features may be quantified and used to assist clinicians in the diagnosis of ROP. These hypotheses will be tested using two Specific Aims: (1) Develop and evaluate semi-automated algorithms to segment retinal vessels and generate a set of retinal vessel-based features. (2) Develop computer-based decision support algorithms that best correlate with expert opinions. Overall, this project will build upon infrastructure developed from previous studies, create potential for improving the accuracy and consistency of clinical ROP diagnosis, provide a demonstration of computer-based decision support from image analysis during real-world medical care, and stimulate future research toward understanding the vascular features associated with severe ROP. This project will be performed by a multi- disciplinary team of investigators with expertise in ophthalmology, biomedical informatics, computer science, machine learning, and image processing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of childhood blindness in the United States and throughout the world, and current diagnostic and documentation methods are often subjective and qualitative. We propose to use existing data sets to develop a web- based, semi-automated system for identifying severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with ""plus disease"" from retinal images.

"Image analysis for high-throughput C. elegans infection and metabolism assays    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput screening (HTS) is a technique for searching large libraries of chemical or genetic perturbants, to find new treatments for a disease or to better understand disease pathways. As automated image analysis for cultured cells has improved, microscopy has emerged as one of the most powerful and informative ways to analyze screening samples. However, many diseases and biological pathways can be better studied in whole animals-particularly diseases that involve organ systems and multicellular interactions, such as metabolism and infection. The worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established and effective model organism, used by thousands of researchers worldwide to study complex biological processes. Samples of C. elegans can be robotically prepared and imaged by high-throughput microscopy, but existing image-analysis methods are insuf- ficient for most assays. In this project, image-analysis algorithms that are capable of scoring high-throughput assays of C. elegans will be developed.  The algorithms will be tested and refined in three high-throughput screens, which will uncover chemical and genetic regulators of fat metabolism and infection: (1) A C. elegans viability assay to identify modulators of infection. The proposed algorithms use a probabilistic shape model of C. elegans in order to identify and mea- sure individual worms even when the animals touch or cross. These methods are the basis for quantifying many other phenotypes, including body morphology and subtle variations in reporter signal levels. (2) A C. elegans lipid assay to identify genes that regulate fat metabolism. The algorithms proposed for illumination correction, level-set-based foreground segmentation, well-edge detection, and artifact removal will result in improved or- business in high-throughput experiments. (3) A fluorescence gene expression assay to identify regulators of the response of the C. elegans host to Staphylococcus aureus infection. The proposed techniques for constructing anatomical maps of C. elegans will make it possible to quantify a variety of changes in fluorescent localization patterns in a biologically relevant way.  In addition to discovering new metabolism- and infection-related drugs and genetic regulators through these specific screens, this work will provide the C. elegans community with (a) a new framework for extracting mor- phological features from C. elegans for quantitative analysis of this organism, and (b) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms enabling the discovery of genetic pathways, chemical probes, and drug can- didates in whole organism high-throughput screens relevant to a variety of diseases.  This work is a close collaboration with C. elegans experts Fred Ausubel and Gary Ruvkun at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, with Polina Golland and Tammy Riklin-Raviv, experts in model-based segmentation and statistical image analysis at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and with Anne Carpenter, developer of open-source image analysis software at the Broad Institute.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large-scale screening experiments that test the effects of thousands of chemicals or genetic perturbants by microscopy and image analysis can discover new treatments and help biomedical scientists understand dis- ease mechanisms. Microscopy screens of cultured cells are routine, but researchers wish to study complex processes like metabolism and infection in a whole animal like the tiny worm Caenorhabditis elegans, for which existing image analysis methods are insufficient. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to automatically identify and measure C. elegans in microscopy images, thereby making it possible for researchers worldwide to screen a wide variety of complex biological processes related to human disease.

"Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment toolbox development & evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Advances in digital imaging technologies have led to a substantial growth in the number of digital images being created and stored in hospitals, medical systems, and on the Internet in recent years. Effective medical image retrieval systems can play an important role in teaching, research, diagnosis and treatment. Images were historically retrieved using text-based methods. The quality of annotations associated with images can reduce the effectiveness of text-based image retrieval. Despite recent advances, purely content- based image retrieval techniques lag significantly behind their textual counterparts in their ability to capture the semantic essence of the user's query. Preliminary research suggests that a more promising approach is to adaptively combine these complementary techniques to suit the user and their information needs. However, for these approaches to succeed, the researcher needs to enhance her computational skills in addition to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the relevant clinical domain. This Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) grant application describes a training and career development plan that will allow the candidate, an NLM postdoctoral fellow in Medical Informatics at Oregon Health & Science University to achieve these objectives. The training component will be carried out under the mentorship of Dr. W. Hersh with Dr. Gorman (user studies). Dr. Fuss (radiation medicine) and Dr. Erdogmus (machine learning) providing additional mentoring in their areas of expertise.       The long-term goal of this Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) project is to improve visual information retrieval by better understanding user needs and proposing adaptive methodologies for multimodal image retrieval that will close the semantic gap. During the award period, activities will be focused on the following specific aims: (1) Understand the image retrieval needs of novice and expert users in radiation oncology and develop gold standards for evaluation; (2) Develop algorithms for semantic, multimodal image retrieval; (3) Perform user based evaluation of adaptive image retrieval in radiation oncology; (4) Extend the techniques developed to create a multimodal image retrieval system in pathology          n/a",Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment toolbox development & evaluation,8522304,R00LM009889,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Distance Learning', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image retrieval system', 'Imaging technology', 'Information Retrieval', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric System', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Oregon', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer site', 'care delivery', 'career development', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'improved', 'information model', 'meetings', 'oncology', 'open source', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'visual information']",NLM,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R00,2013,216041,0.049326318929795096
"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network.

"Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use light/fluorescence microscopes to image cells and other biological samples. There is strong and growing demand for software to analyze these images, as automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye and the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex. We have begun to address this demand with CellProfiler, a versatile, open-source software tool for quantifying data from biological images, particularly in high-throughput experiments (www.cellprofiler.org). CellProfiler can extract valuable biological information from images quickly while increasing the objectivity and statistical power of assays. In the three years since its release, it has become widely used, having been downloaded more than 8,000 times by users in over 60 countries. Using CellProfiler's point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized chain of image analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. The software evolved in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning. To enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler, we propose to improve its capabilities, interface, and support: First, we will add user-requested capabilities, leveraging existing open-source projects by interoperating with them where feasible. These new features will include object tracking in time-lapse movies, compatibility with additional file formats, new image processing algorithms, and expanded tools for quality control, performance evaluation, cluster computing, and workflow management. Second, we will improve the interface, increase processing speed, and simplify the addition of new features by refactoring and porting the MATLAB-based code to an open-source language and instituting proven software development practices. Third, we will provide user, educator, and developer support and outreach for CellProfiler. These activities will facilitate research in the scientific community and help guide usability improvements. These improvements to the only open-source software for modular, high-throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from cell images across all disciplines within biology. Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and  other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from  microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our user-friendly, open-source cell image  analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org).",Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software,8479372,R01GM089652,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Language', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Process Measure', 'Quality Control', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'cluster computing', 'file format', 'fluorescence microscope', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'movie', 'open source', 'outreach', 'processing speed', 'repository', 'research study', 'resource guides', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web interface']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2013,474880,0.039750116009881216
"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that advances machine learning algorithms for automatic segmentation and couples these techniques to a scalable tool suite for multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate results.",SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID,8461069,R01NS075314,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computers and Advanced Instrumentation', 'Couples', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Online Systems', 'Organelles', 'Participant', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'biological systems', 'cellular imaging', 'complex biological systems', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'electron optics', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'tomography', 'tool', 'web interface']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2013,425454,0.010536754181324052
"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.                ",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,8477880,R01EY023279,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Papilledema', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability burden', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'public health relevance']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2013,339750,0.006006276861475071
"Cloud-computer-aided diagnostic imaging decision support system     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-performance cloud computing (HPCC) is an integration of high-performance computing (HPC) with cloud computing that provides an alternative informatics infrastructure to deliver the supercomputer power needed for developing and reading high quality, multidimensional diagnostic images on desktop or mobile devices. Such infrastructure would advance the use of high-throughput cancer screening like virtual colonoscopy (VC), also known as computed tomography colonography (CTC). The goals of this proposal are to develop and validate the clinical benefits of a mobile HPCC-Virtual Colonoscopy decision support system (HPCC-VC) that integrates novel high-performance electronic cleansing and computer-aided detection schemes. The combination of high performance electronic cleansing (hpEC) with high performance computer aided detection (hpCAD) will allow visualization of the entire mucosal surface of the colon without artifact. Specifically, we hypothesize that the mobile HPCC-VC system will improve the quality of electronic cleansing of non-cathartic CTC (ncCTC) images, will deliver images 100 times faster than conventional approaches, and will improve reader performance in the detection of colonic lesions in the images analyzed on mobile high-resolution display devices.  To achieve these goals, an HPCC platform will be established by use of a CPU-cluster-based supercomputing and parallel image processing libraries. Then, an hpEC scheme will be developed that effectively removes the residual fecal materials in ncCTC images. In parallel, a high-resolution hpCAD scheme will be developed to support high-performance detection of colonic lesions in ncCTC. These schemes will be integrated into a mobile HPCC-VC system on the HPCC platform. Necessary preliminary studies in the development of computed EC and CAD schemes show promise; and the development and deployment of the HPCC platform will advance the quality, speed, and utility of high performance, multidimensional imaging for colon cancer screening. A comprehensive reader performance study will be conducted to determine the clinical application and benefit of images analyzed and delivered through an HPCC platform.  Successful development of HPCC-VC will demonstrate the clinical benefit of the platform for improved diagnostic imaging and facilitation of accurate, high-throughput colon cancer screening that is highly acceptable to patients. In the longer term, broad adoption and use of the HPCC-VC system will facilitate early and accurate diagnoses, and thus reduce mortality from colon cancer.          Successful development of the HPCC-VC system will demonstrate the clinical benefit of HPCC platform for diagnostic imaging, and will provide a high-throughput colon cancer screening scheme for colorectal lesions that is highly acceptable to patients and highly accurate. Such a system will promote the early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reduce the mortality due to colon cancer.

"Automatic 3D Quantification of Synapse Distribution in Complex Dendritic Arbor     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The subcellular distribution of synapses is critical for the assembly, function, and plasticity of the nervous system and plays a role in its disorders. Underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remain largely unknown. While advanced multidimensional images, in conjunction with single-cell genetic techniques, have afforded an unprecedented opportunity to understand synapse development at a new level, there is a knowledge gap in our capacity to effectively quantify subcellular synapses from large quantities of three-dimensional images. This is a significant problem and has hampered large-scale studies of the molecular mechanisms of synapse development, especially in neurons with complex arbor-such as Purkinje cells in mammals and lobula plate tangential cells (LPTC) in Drosophila-where existing approaches do not yield complete or robust synapse quantification for the entire dendritic tree and do not scale to efficient genetic screening. The objective of thi project is to bridge this gap by providing tools for quantitative investigation of subcellular synapse distribution and its molecular mechanisms using three-dimensional microscopy images. Specifically, our highly cross- disciplinary team will pursue two aims: (1) Develop automatic algorithms to analyze and quantify synapse distribution in the entire dendritic tree of neurons with complex arbor. Holistic and objective description of synapse density will enable automatic detection of mutant patterns. (2) Develop automatic algorithms to analyze and quantify synapse distribution in different parts of the entire dendritic tree of neurons with complex arbor. Efficient quantification at distinct subcellular locations will assist discovery of novel regulators for different subcellular parts. As a test case, we will use synapse distribution n Drosophila LPTC neurons, which are amenable to both genome-wide genetic screens and genetic manipulations with single-neuron resolution. We will develop reliable methods to characterize the density of inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory cholinergic synapses from three-dimensional fluorescence confocal images. Our algorithms will lead to the next level of mechanistic understanding that controls the subcellular distribution of inhibitory and excitatory synapses, and enable a wide range of quantitative analyses for other types of neurons with similar complexity. Powerful multichannel co-analysis and machine learning approaches will be used to improve synapse detection and subcellular compartment extraction for overcoming challenges in 3D confocal image, including staining artifacts and anisotropic resolution. Algorithms will be developed using a model-guided methodology that emphasizes efficiency for large volume 3D images during genetic screening. Pattern-recognition methods will be used to speed up proofreading of the synapse quantification results. A novel ordering strategy will be adapted for neurons of complex dendritic arbor to quantify subcellular synapses in a functionally meaningful way. The project will produce a set of open-source, extensible tools for automatic synapse quantification and proofreading, with friendly graphical-user interfaces, to serve the neuroscience community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The underlying molecular mechanisms for the subcellular distribution of synapses remain largely unknown, which hinders the discovery of novel therapies for many neurological disorders. By developing new, efficient automatic algorithms and open-source tools for quantifying synapses in neurons, this research intends to advance the capacity to effectively analyze large quantities of three-dimensional neuronal images, especially those of complex dendritic arbor. The work will impact public health by enabling a better understanding of disease mechanisms, which is the critical first step toward new treatments, and supports NIH's goal to advance understanding of fundamental biology to uncover the causes of specific diseases.            ",Automatic 3D Quantification of Synapse Distribution in Complex Dendritic Arbor,8574710,R15MH099569,"['Academic Research Enhancement Awards', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dendrites', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fluorescence', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cholinergic synapse', 'density', 'falls', 'genetic manipulation', 'genome-wide', 'graduate student', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mutant', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,NORTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY,R15,2013,461165,-0.008507770007603357
"BIGDATA Small Project Structurization and Direct Search of Medical Image Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): IBM estimates that 30% of the entire data in the world is medical information. Medical images occupy a significant portion of medical records with approximately 100 million scans in US and growing every year. In addition, the data size from each scan steadfastly increases as the image resolution improves. These BigData are not structured and due to lack of standardized imaging protocols, they are highly heterogeneous with different spatial resolutions, contrasts, slice orientations, etc. In this project, we will deelop a technology to structure and search medical imaging information, which will make the past data available for education and evidence-based clinical decision-making. In this grant, we will focus on brain MRI, which comprises the largest portion of MRI data. The target community will be physicians who make decisions and the patients will be the ultimate beneficiaries. Currently, radiological image data are stored in clinical database called PACS. The image data in PACS are not structured. Consequently, once the diagnosis of a patient is completed, most of the data in PACS are currently discarded in the archive. Radiologists rely on their experience and education to reach medical decisions. This is a typical problem in medical practice that calls for objective evidence-based medicine. There are many ongoing attempts to structure the text fields of PACS, which include natural language processing of free-text radiological reports, clinical information, and diagnosis. In our approach, we propose to structure the image data, not text fields, to support direct search of images. Namely, physicians will submit an image of a new patient and search past images with similar anatomical phenotypes. Then, the clinical reports of the retrieved data will be compiled for a statistical report of the diagnosis and prognosis. We believe this image structuration is the key to ""unlock the vast amounts of information currently stored"" in PACS and use them for education and modern evidence-based medical decisions. The specific aims are; Objective 1: To develop and test the accuracy of high-throughput image structuration technologies Objective 2: To develop and test the image search engine Objective 3: Capacity Building Requirement: To develop prototype cloud system for data structuration / search services for research and educational purposes                  n/a",BIGDATA Small Project Structurization and Direct Search of Medical Image Data,8599843,R01EB017638,"['Archives', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'beneficiary', 'clinical decision-making', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'outcome forecast', 'prototype', 'radiologist']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,224942,0.032284069694881935
"BIGDATA: Small DCM: ESCA DA Computational infrastructure for massive neurosci     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ideally, as neuroscientists collect terabytes of image stacks, the data are automatically processed for open access and analysis. Yet, while several labs around the world are collecting data at unprecedented rates- up to terabytes per day-the computational technologies that facilitate streaming data-intensive computing remain absent. Also deploying data-intensive compute clusters is beyond the means and abilities of most experimental labs. This project will extend, develop, and deploy such technologies. To demonstrate these tools, we will utilize them in support of the ongoing mouse brain architecture (MBA) project, which already has amassed over 0.5 petabytes (PBs) of image data. The main computational challenges posed by these datasets are ones of scale. The tasks that follow remain relatively stereotyped across acquisition modalities. Until now, labs collecting data on this scale have been almost entirely isolated, left to ""reinvent the wheel"" for each of these problems. Moreover, the extant solutions are insufficient for a number of reasons: they often include numerous excel spreadsheets that rely on manual data entry, they lack scalable scientific database backends, and they run on ad hoc clusters not specifically designed for the computational tasks at hand. We aim to augment the current state of the art by implementing the following technological advancements into the MBA project pipeline: (1) Data Management will consist of a unified system that automatically captures metadata, launches processing pipelines, and provides quality control feedback in minutes instead of hours. (2) Data Processing tasks will run algorithms ""out-of-core"", appropriate for their computational requirements, including registration, alignment, and semantic segmentation of cell bodies and processes. (3) Data Storage will automatically build databases for storing multimodal image data and extracted annotations learned from the machine vision algorithms. These databases will be spatially co-registered and stored on an optimized heterogeneous compute cluster. (4) Data Access will be automatically available to everyone-including all the image data and data derived products-via Web-services, including 3D viewing, downloading, and further processing. (5) Data Analytics will extend random graph models suitable for multiscale circuit graphs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Nervous system disorders are responsible for approximately 30% of the total burden of illness in the United States. Whole brain neuroanatomy-available from massive neuroscientific image stacks-is widely believed to be a key missing link in our ability to prevent and treat such illnesses.

"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers. The application is optimization of a parallel-hole collimator design for In-111 NET imaging.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomog- raphy (SPECT) has a significant role in cancer diagnosis and management. Still, early detection offers the best chances for surviving many cancers and refining the diagnostic capabilities of these modali- ties for small tumors continues to be a major research focus. This work is focused on the development of assessment methods for assisting in the early identification of technological advances that could improve the diagnostic utility of PET and SPECT.

"In-field FAST Procedure Support and Automation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) procedure is an ultrasound examination performed to identify intra-peritoneal hemorrhage or pericardial tamponade. FAST involves the detection of free fluid in ultrasound images from four specific abdominal areas. Unstable patients with positive FAST results are operated on, and stable patients with negative results tend to be observed.  We propose to develop the hardware and image analysis algorithms necessary for novice ultrasound operators to perform life-saving FAST procedures. The proposed system will consist of a low-cost ultrasound probe, connected to a ruggedize tablet computer, running innovative computer vision algorithms, embedded in an intuitive application. Using that system, a novice operator will be visually guided to acquire ultrasound images from the abdominal locations and quantify the free fluid in those images.  The target for our initial deployment of the system is level 3 and 4 trauma centers. These centers must often serve areas spanning hundreds and even thousands of miles; however, they are typically under-staffed and under-equipped.  The proposal is being clinically driven by Jeffrey Lowell, MD. He is a USNR Trauma Surgeon, and he was recently deployed to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, the only Level I Trauma Center outside the U.S.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) procedure is an ultrasound-based examination for rapidly detecting blood in the abdomen, particularly after blunt abdominal trauma, which is common, for example, with car accidents. The challenge is that the FAST procedure requires expertise and equipment which is not commonly available at level 3 and 4 trauma centers that serve rural populations. We propose to develop the hardware and image analysis algorithms necessary for novice ultrasound operators to perform life- saving FAST procedures.

"Perception of Tactile Graphics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad objective of the proposed research is to answer the following question: why are tactile graphics difficult to understand? People with normal vision can easily recognize line drawings of objects. However, both blind and sighted people find it very difficult to recognize the same drawings when they are presented as tactile images. For blind people, tactile graphics are the only solution for accessing information in visual diagrams and illustrations found in textbooks. Consequently, the results of the proposed research will be used to improve the production of tactile graphics so that they are better understood by blind people. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) explore how the complexity of tactile images affects perception, 2) determine the effects of spatial and temporal integration on perception of tactile images, and 3) investigate how well people can recognize tactile images of objects embedded in backgrounds. The general methodology of the proposed experiments is to present participants with tactile images and to have them draw what they perceive the images to be. Blind individuals will draw tactile images using special paper and a stylus. The experimenters will evaluate the drawings by using a quantitative measure that computes a distance score reflecting the discrepancy between the original image and the participant's drawing. In the first study, participants will feel tactile stimuli of varying complexity, from simple lines in different orientations to complex depictions of objects. The second study will determine the limitations of tactile perceptual integration by limiting either the spatial or temporal window over which participants feel the image. Participants will either view or feel images through apertures of various sizes (spatial window) or they will have a limited amount of time to view or feel the images (temporal window). In the third study, participants will feel tactile images of objects embedded in simple backgrounds. This research will impact several areas of study, including computer vision, human object and scene recognition, and low vision rehabilitation.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance The proposed research seeks to improve the translation of visual graphics into tactile graphics for use by visually-impaired individuals. By making the information in visual graphics more accessible, this research will improve educational services for people with low vision. This work will also facilitate the development of better visual-to-tactile substitution technologies.

"In vivo Characterization of Stents using Intravascular OCT Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intravascular stents. Although the technology has advanced and drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent parameters include drug choice, bioresorbable versus metal, mechanical design, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To optimize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical studies. Intravascular OCT (iOCT) alone provides the resolution and contrast s necessary for in vivo interrogation of vascular healing; stent deployment issues such as malposition; and assessment of stent strut tissue coverage. The Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory at CWRU analyzes iOCT images as a service to numerous clinical and preclinical trials from around the world. An analyst takes many hours to analyze manually a single stent, greatly limiting the size and number of studies. Despite training and quality assurance measures, inter-analyst variability limits the ability to determine changes between stent types. We will develop highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibility, increase accuracy, etc. Careful evaluations/validations will be performed using our database of >1500 manually analyzed stents, and new phantom and pig studies. With the successful completion of this research and development, we will deliver well-validated, highly automated software, which will enable routine use of iOCT for sensitive evaluation of emerging stent technologies, thereby providing greatly improved treatments of cardiovascular disease. In addition, fast, robust software will contribute to clinical usage of iOCT for assessment of stent deployment and healing of a stented vessel.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year.

"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional  Abstract Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of statistical frameworks and methods for the analysis of complex ultra-high-dimensional biomedical imaging.

"Digital Pathology_Accuracy Viewing Behavior and Image Characterization     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 1.4 million women per year depend on pathologists to accurately interpret breast biopsies for a diagnosis of benign disease or cancer. Diagnostic errors are alarmingly frequent and likely lead to altered patient treatment, especially at the thresholds of atypical hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ, where up to 50% of cases are misclassified. The causes underlying these errors remain largely unknown.  Technology similar to Google Maps now allows pan and zoom manipulation of high-resolution digital images of glass microscope slides. This technology has virtually replaced the microscope in medical schools and is rapidly diffusing into U.S. pathology practices. No research has evaluated the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists' interpretion of digital images vs. glass slides. However, these ""digital slides"" offer a novel opportunity to study the accuracy, efficiency, and viewing behavior of a large number of pathologists as they manipulate and interpret images. The innovative analytic techniques proposed in this application are similar to those used to improve the performance of pilots and air traffic controllers. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Digital Image vs. Glass Slides: To compare the interpretive accuracy of pathologists viewing digitized slide images over the Internet to their performance viewing original glass slides under a microscope. A randomized national sample of pathologists (N=200) will interpret 240 test cases in one or both formats in two phases. Measures will include a diagnostic assessment for each test case and for digital slides, cursor- (i.e., mouse) tracking data and region of interest (ROI) markings. Completion of this aim will establish benchmarks for the comparative diagnostic accuracy of whole-slide digital images.  Aim 2. Interpretive Screening Behavior: To identify visual scanning patterns associated with diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Detailed simultaneous eye-tracking and cursor-tracking data will be collected on 60 additional pathologists while they interpret digital slides to complement data from Aim 1. Viewing patterns will be analyzed from computer representations of raw movement data. Videos depicting accurate, efficient visual scanning and cursor movement will be valuable tools in educating the next generation of digital pathologists. Aim 3. Image Analyses: To examine and classify the image characteristics (including color, texture, and structure) of ROIs captured in Aims 1 and 2. Computer-based statistical learning techniques will be used to identify image characteristics that lead to correct and incorrect diagnoses. Characteristics of both diagnostic and distracting ROIs will be identified, linking all three aims. In summary, we will determine whether digitized whole-slide images are diagnostically equivalent to original glass slides. Our in-depth scientific evaluation of viewing patterns and characteristics of ROIs identified by pathologists will be critical to understanding diagnostic errors and sources of distraction. Optimization of viewing techniques will improve diagnostic performance and thus, the quality of clinical care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pathologist errors in the interpretation of biopsy specimens can result in significant harm to patients. Digital imaging technology is rapidly diffusing into medical settings, providing a unique opportunity to obtain data on the process used by pathologists when interpreting slides. The results will provide the foundation needed to improve interpretive accuracy and efficiency, support quality improvement efforts, and ultimately reduce the burden of misdiagnosis on patients and the health care delivery system.            ",Digital Pathology_Accuracy Viewing Behavior and Image Characterization,8420220,R01CA172343,"['Adoption', 'Air', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Atypical hyperplasia', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Breast', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Error Sources', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Rural Hospitals', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientific Evaluation', 'Slide', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative', 'computer monitor', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'distraction', 'eye hand coordination', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'migration', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transmission process']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2013,682340,0.011917332823263113
"Coupled level set framework for retinal segmentation and atlasing in SD-OCT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Some eye diseases exhibit abnormalities or atrophy of the retina, which can impair vision and cause blindness. Certain other diseases traditionally thought to be exclusively associated with the brain are now known to be associated with changes or differences in the retina, which can also impair vision. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), an imaging device that is enabling modern in-vivo high-resolution studies of the retina, is rapidly becoming a key imaging technology both in ophthalmology, where clinical diagnoses and disease monitoring are experiencing a dramatic technical revolution, and also in neurology, where noninvasive retinal markers of brain disease are beginning to emerge. A key limitation in the current technology is the lack of detailed, accurate, and fully-automated analysis of the retinal layers that are observed throughout the retina in a typical three-dimensional spectral domain (SD)-OCT exam. Although tools are beginning to appear in association with commercial devices, they are currently lacking in sophistication and are not validated or standardized across manufacturers. This deficiency is problematic for both clinical and scientific application of SD-OCT since the measurements are not of known precision and are therefore not easily compared both in the same subject longitudinally and in population cross sections. The proposed research takes advantage of state-of-the-art algorithms that are emerging in both computer vision and medical imaging and will apply, adapt, and extend them to the specific application of layer segmentation in three-dimensional retinal SD-OCT. Advanced tools for population averaging in a normalized space will also be developed specifically for retinal SD-OCT data. The methods will be validated against manual segmentation and normalization on both normal subjects and patients experiencing retinal degeneration largely associated with thinning of selective layers of the retina. Scans of patients with diseases causing significant retinopathy such as cysts, detachment, or scarring will be evaluated, but further development beyond the present research is expected to be needed to properly segment and quantify such cases. The developed software will be developed within the open-source Java Image Science Toolkit (JIST) framework and released as open source software.        The project will develop software for the image analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the retina. Segmentation and quantification of the characteristics of nerve layers within the retina is expected to be of great use on both ophthalmology and neurology, where the retina can be a sensitive indicator of both vision and neurological problems or diseases. Open source software written in a highly portable language will be made available to the research community at the conclusion of the research grant.

"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project will combine attributes of advanced ultrasound and magnetic-resonance techniques and embody them in a prototype imaging system capable of generating novel tissue-type images that reliably depict PCa in real-time.

"Spatially Accurate Deformable Image Registration for Thoracic C Applications    DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant)   Abstract:  Deformable image registration (DIR) is a cross-cutting technology with diagnostic and therapeutic medical applications. DIR algorithms were first developed in computer vision research to estimate motion between a source and target image, the resulting registered image visually appears similar to the target image. For medical applications the goal in applying DIR is to obtain an accurate spatial registration of the underlying anatomy and not simply image similarity. We developed a statistical framework for quantitative evaluation of DIR spatial accuracy based on large samples of expert-determined landmark features. Central to this framework is the statistical relationship between the number of landmark points required to assess spatial accuracy, the desired uncertainty range of the mean error, and an a priori estimated behavior of the DIR. DIR is at the heart of our strategy to quantify COPD small airway disease air-trapping and four dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) ventilation. The optimal DIR algorithm and its spatial accuracy in registering the underlying anatomy should be assessed for each application. We will develop and test new DIR algorithms for exhale and inhale breath-hold CT (eBH-CT & iBH-CT) images pairs (COPD air trapping evaluation) and for 4D CT images (4D CT ventilation). Current CT image analysis methods for COPD evaluation focus on the separate anatomic evaluation of the eBH-CT & iBH-CT images. They are unable to find air-trapping due to bronchiolitis alone. We propose to evaluate the eBH- & iBH CT image pairs simultaneously using DIR to link the two to identify regions of air-trapping due to both emphysema and bronchiolitis. Next, to continue our development of ventilation imaging derived from 4D CT, we will test the ability of 4D CT ventilation image guidance to reduce pulmonary function loss after radiotherapy in a randomized phase II trial for non-small cell lung cancer patients.    Public Health Relevance:  This study will develop novel image registration methods and their application, with an emphasis on application specific validation. With this technology we will develop and test methods to find air-trapping in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. We will test our novel ventilation imaging method in radiation treatment planning to reduce normal lung injury after treatment for lung cancer.      ",Spatially Accurate Deformable Image Registration for Thoracic C Applications,8558551,DP2OD007044,"['4D Imaging', 'Aftercare', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Behavior', 'Breathing', 'Bronchiolitis', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Exhalation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Link', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Patients', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Vision research', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abstracting', 'base', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'lung injury', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'pulmonary function', 'small airways disease', 'treatment planning']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,DP2,2013,201518,0.00023103293153713364
"ENTROPY-BASED TISSUE DISCRIMINATORS No abstract available PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: All skilled clinical practitioners and interpreters of ultrasound studies realize that much information exists in recorded US images that is processed immediately by the visual cortex and is useful for qualitatively defining pathology, yet defies ready quantification by any robust algorithm. Traditional energy-based representations display grayscale intensities and speckle patterns that have been mapped parametrically into various tissue classification schemes that have yet to demonstrate organ or tissue specificity, although progress has been reported in distinguishing pathologies over the last 30 years. However, the fact that US signal processing and representation of backscatter data in terms of energy functions has not changed over the last 50 years suggests that alternative signal processing schemes may be indicated to represent the richness of the information contained within the backscattered data. To meet this challenge, we have been involved over the past 10 years in processing backscattered RF to create ""information"" images and in designing ""information sensitive"" approaches to classifying the data sets based on statistical analysis of these images These novel and user independent metrics utilize the entropy of windowed segments of radiofrequency (RF) backscatter signal from tis- sue, which represents a radical departure from grayscale or speckle metrics. In this approach the entropy of the backscattered segment is used to produce a pixel value in the tissue image. This processing strategy has proven to be sensitive to weak, sub-resolution sized changes in tissue.            ",ENTROPY-BASED TISSUE DISCRIMINATORS,8636638,R21EB018095,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Base Composition', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Cardiac', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Expeditions', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Fractals', 'Frequencies', 'Heart', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Ischemia', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Microscopic', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Radio', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data reduction', 'design', 'detector', 'heart motion', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'n-dimensional', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'radiofrequency', 'sound', 'tissue processing', 'vector']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,228000,0.022536506563279844

"Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment toolbox development & evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Advances in digital imaging technologies have led to a substantial growth in the number of digital images being created and stored in hospitals, medical systems, and on the Internet in recent years. Effective medical image retrieval systems can play an important role in teaching, research, diagnosis and treatment. Images were historically retrieved using text-based methods. The quality of annotations associated with images can reduce the effectiveness of text-based image retrieval. Despite recent advances, purely content- based image retrieval techniques lag significantly behind their textual counterparts in their ability to capture the semantic essence of the user's query. Preliminary research suggests that a more promising approach is to adaptively combine these complementary techniques to suit the user and their information needs. However, for these approaches to succeed, the researcher needs to enhance her computational skills in addition to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the relevant clinical domain. This Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) grant application describes a training and career development plan that will allow the candidate, an NLM postdoctoral fellow in Medical Informatics at Oregon Health & Science University to achieve these objectives. The training component will be carried out under the mentorship of Dr. W. Hersh with Dr. Gorman (user studies). Dr. Fuss (radiation medicine) and Dr. Erdogmus (machine learning) providing additional mentoring in their areas of expertise.       The long-term goal of this Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) project is to improve visual information retrieval by better understanding user needs and proposing adaptive methodologies for multimodal image retrieval that will close the semantic gap. During the award period, activities will be focused on the following specific aims: (1) Understand the image retrieval needs of novice and expert users in radiation oncology and develop gold standards for evaluation; (2) Develop algorithms for semantic, multimodal image retrieval; (3) Perform user based evaluation of adaptive image retrieval in radiation oncology; (4) Extend the techniques developed to create a multimodal image retrieval system in pathology          n/a",Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment toolbox development & evaluation,8323502,R00LM009889,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Distance Learning', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image retrieval system', 'Imaging technology', 'Information Retrieval', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric System', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Oregon', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer site', 'care delivery', 'career development', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'improved', 'information model', 'meetings', 'oncology', 'open source', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'visual information']",NLM,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R00,2012,234509,0.049326318929795096
"Image analysis for high-throughput C. elegans infection and metabolism assays    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput screening (HTS) is a technique for searching large libraries of chemical or genetic perturbants, to find new treatments for a disease or to better understand disease pathways. As automated image analysis for cultured cells has improved, microscopy has emerged as one of the most powerful and informative ways to analyze screening samples. However, many diseases and biological pathways can be better studied in whole animals-particularly diseases that involve organ systems and multicellular interactions, such as metabolism and infection. The worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established and effective model organism, used by thousands of researchers worldwide to study complex biological processes. Samples of C. elegans can be robotically prepared and imaged by high-throughput microscopy, but existing image-analysis methods are insuf- ficient for most assays. In this project, image-analysis algorithms that are capable of scoring high-throughput assays of C. elegans will be developed.  The algorithms will be tested and refined in three high-throughput screens, which will uncover chemical and genetic regulators of fat metabolism and infection: (1) A C. elegans viability assay to identify modulators of infection. The proposed algorithms use a probabilistic shape model of C. elegans in order to identify and mea- sure individual worms even when the animals touch or cross. These methods are the basis for quantifying many other phenotypes, including body morphology and subtle variations in reporter signal levels. (2) A C. elegans lipid assay to identify genes that regulate fat metabolism. The algorithms proposed for illumination correction, level-set-based foreground segmentation, well-edge detection, and artifact removal will result in improved or- business in high-throughput experiments. (3) A fluorescence gene expression assay to identify regulators of the response of the C. elegans host to Staphylococcus aureus infection. The proposed techniques for constructing anatomical maps of C. elegans will make it possible to quantify a variety of changes in fluorescent localization patterns in a biologically relevant way.  In addition to discovering new metabolism- and infection-related drugs and genetic regulators through these specific screens, this work will provide the C. elegans community with (a) a new framework for extracting mor- phological features from C. elegans for quantitative analysis of this organism, and (b) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms enabling the discovery of genetic pathways, chemical probes, and drug can- didates in whole organism high-throughput screens relevant to a variety of diseases.  This work is a close collaboration with C. elegans experts Fred Ausubel and Gary Ruvkun at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, with Polina Golland and Tammy Riklin-Raviv, experts in model-based segmentation and statistical image analysis at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and with Anne Carpenter, developer of open-source image analysis software at the Broad Institute.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large-scale screening experiments that test the effects of thousands of chemicals or genetic perturbants by microscopy and image analysis can discover new treatments and help biomedical scientists understand dis- ease mechanisms.

"Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use light/fluorescence microscopes to image cells and other biological samples. There is strong and growing demand for software to analyze these images, as automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye and the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex.  We have begun to address this demand with CellProfiler, a versatile, open-source software tool for quantifying data from biological images, particularly in high-throughput experiments (www.cellprofiler.org). CellProfiler can extract valuable biological information from images quickly while increasing the objectivity and statistical power of assays. In the three years since its release, it has become widely used, having been downloaded more than 8,000 times by users in over 60 countries. Using CellProfiler's point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized chain of image analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. The software evolved in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  To enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler, we propose to improve its capabilities, interface, and support:  First, we will add user-requested capabilities, leveraging existing open-source projects by interoperating with them where feasible. These new features will include object tracking in time-lapse movies, compatibility with additional file formats, new image processing algorithms, and expanded tools for quality control, performance evaluation, cluster computing, and workflow management.  Second, we will improve the interface, increase processing speed, and simplify the addition of new features by refactoring and porting the MATLAB-based code to an open-source language and instituting proven software development practices.  Third, we will provide user, educator, and developer support and outreach for CellProfiler. These activities will facilitate research in the scientific community and help guide usability improvements.  These improvements to the only open-source software for modular, high-throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from cell images across all disciplines within biology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:           Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and  other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from  microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our user-friendly, open-source cell image  analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org).",Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software,8274831,R01GM089652,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Language', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Process Measure', 'Quality Control', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'cluster computing', 'file format', 'fluorescence microscope', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'movie', 'open source', 'outreach', 'processing speed', 'repository', 'research study', 'resource guides', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web interface']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2012,503268,0.03982640670321144
"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses.

"Cloud-computer-aided diagnostic imaging decision support system     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-performance cloud computing (HPCC) is an integration of high-performance computing (HPC) with cloud computing that provides an alternative informatics infrastructure to deliver the supercomputer power needed for developing and reading high quality, multidimensional diagnostic images on desktop or mobile devices. Such infrastructure would advance the use of high-throughput cancer screening like virtual colonoscopy (VC), also known as computed tomography colonography (CTC). The goals of this proposal are to develop and validate the clinical benefits of a mobile HPCC-Virtual Colonoscopy decision support system (HPCC-VC) that integrates novel high-performance electronic cleansing and computer-aided detection schemes. The combination of high performance electronic cleansing (hpEC) with high performance computer aided detection (hpCAD) will allow visualization of the entire mucosal surface of the colon without artifact. Specifically, we hypothesize that the mobile HPCC-VC system will improve the quality of electronic cleansing of non-cathartic CTC (ncCTC) images, will deliver images 100 times faster than conventional approaches, and will improve reader performance in the detection of colonic lesions in the images analyzed on mobile high-resolution display devices.  To achieve these goals, an HPCC platform will be established by use of a CPU-cluster-based supercomputing and parallel image processing libraries. Then, an hpEC scheme will be developed that effectively removes the residual fecal materials in ncCTC images. In parallel, a high-resolution hpCAD scheme will be developed to support high-performance detection of colonic lesions in ncCTC. These schemes will be integrated into a mobile HPCC-VC system on the HPCC platform. Necessary preliminary studies in the development of computed EC and CAD schemes show promise; and the development and deployment of the HPCC platform will advance the quality, speed, and utility of high performance, multidimensional imaging for colon cancer screening. A comprehensive reader performance study will be conducted to determine the clinical application and benefit of images analyzed and delivered through an HPCC platform.  Successful development of HPCC-VC will demonstrate the clinical benefit of the platform for improved diagnostic imaging and facilitation of accurate, high-throughput colon cancer screening that is highly acceptable to patients. In the longer term, broad adoption and use of the HPCC-VC system will facilitate early and accurate diagnoses, and thus reduce mortality from colon cancer.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful development of the HPCC-VC system will demonstrate the clinical benefit of HPCC platform for diagnostic imaging, and will provide a high-throughput colon cancer screening scheme for colorectal lesions that is highly acceptable to patients and highly accurate.

"Objective imaging-based assessment of smoking behavior from used filters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate measurement of smoking behaviors and exposures may become critical as FDA implements its authority to regulate tobacco products, and in particular proposes product standards and considers approval of modified risk products. Recently, digital image analysis systems have been developed that can identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters with high accuracy and can also estimate the degree of smoker compensation. There is strong potential for such digital imaging systems to unobtrusively infer a rich set of smoker topography variables as well as a smoker's exposure to toxins. The existing literature base on filter-based assays is growing and points to growing prominence and applicability of these approaches to important research questions. We propose to modify existing analysis systems and conduct a series of studies to test their reliability, validity, and applicability for determining mouth- level cigarette smoke exposure by examining tar stains on cigarette filter butts. The Specific Aims are designed to provide rigorous evaluations of the utility of the systems, from establishing prediction equations using machine-smoked cigarettes to cross- validation in human-smoked samples against other established measures of mouth-level exposure. At the conclusion of this project, we plan to release a validated suite of software to the research community to support external verification of digital image analysis for smoking-related research.        Accurately and simply measuring smoking behavior and smoke exposure is important, and digital image analysis systems have been developed that can estimate smoke intake and identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters. The proposed project will modify existing analysis systems and conduct a series of studies to test their reliability, validity, and applicability for determining mouth-level cigarette smoke exposure. We plan to make a suite of software publicly available to allow others to apply this technology in their own research.

"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers. The application is optimization of a parallel-hole collimator design for In-111 NET imaging.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomog- raphy (SPECT) has a significant role in cancer diagnosis and management. Still, early detection offers the best chances for surviving many cancers and refining the diagnostic capabilities of these modali- ties for small tumors continues to be a major research focus.

"New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging has become a standard component of modern cardiology. In SPECT research (as in medical imaging generally), it has become widely accepted that advances in imaging hardware and algorithms should be guided by so-called task-based evaluation criteria, i.e., measures that reflect how the imaging technique will impact clinical decision making. In general, a human observer study is the gold standard for measuring task-based criteria; however, the expense and complexity of such studies precludes their routine use. Therefore, numerical observers-algorithms that emulate human observer performance-are now widely used as surrogates for human observers. In SPECT, one particular numerical observer, known as the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), has come to dominate the field. The CHO is a detection algorithm that is used to approximate the human observer's performance in detecting lesions; in the case of cardiac SPECT, the lesions of interest are perfusion defects. An imaging system or algorithm can be judged by the ability of the CHO to accurately detect defects based on the images produced. SPECT researchers now rely heavily (and sometimes exclusively) on numerical observers such as the CHO, not only to validate their final results, but also as a figure of merit that guides optimization of hardware or algorithms. Because of the central role it has come to play, the CHO and its extensions have become a major research topic in their own right. In the proposed project, our goal will be to create a suite of numerical observers that will shed light on a much wider set of clinical tasks than the CHO, and we will pursue an approach that we hypothesize will be more accurate than the CHO. Therefore, the proposed research is significant because it will yield an evaluation methodology that could potentially be used very widely by the research community, underpinning the development of imaging hardware and software. We will develop a software package for image quality assessment using the proposed NO approach and distribute it freely to the research community. As a by-product of the research, the proposed project will also yield a thorough task-based evaluation of major image reconstruction algorithms, and will answer the question of which sorts of data (on the spectrum from simple phantoms to clinical data) are a sufficient foundation for numerical observers to perform as desired. The research will also yield the basis for a potential computer aided diagnostic system for cardiology. The specific aims of the research will be as follows: 1) Create a comprehensive set of imaging data and human observer scores; 2) Develop a suite of numerical observers based on our novel learning-based approach, as well as more-conventional statistical decision theory principles; 3) Compare and evaluate the numerical observers; and 4) Develop and disseminate by-products of the research program.          n/a",New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology,8234040,R01HL091017,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Viability', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer program', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'standard measure', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2012,424407,0.008330658958951674
"Coupled level set framework for retinal segmentation and atlasing in SD-OCT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Some eye diseases exhibit abnormalities or atrophy of the retina, which can impair vision and cause blindness. Certain other diseases traditionally thought to be exclusively associated with the brain are now known to be associated with changes or differences in the retina, which can also impair vision. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), an imaging device that is enabling modern in-vivo high-resolution studies of the retina, is rapidly becoming a key imaging technology both in ophthalmology, where clinical diagnoses and disease monitoring are experiencing a dramatic technical revolution, and also in neurology, where noninvasive retinal markers of brain disease are beginning to emerge. A key limitation in the current technology is the lack of detailed, accurate, and fully-automated analysis of the retinal layers that are observed throughout the retina in a typical three-dimensional spectral domain (SD)-OCT exam. Although tools are beginning to appear in association with commercial devices, they are currently lacking in sophistication and are not validated or standardized across manufacturers. This deficiency is problematic for both clinical and scientific application of SD-OCT since the measurements are not of known precision and are therefore not easily compared both in the same subject longitudinally and in population cross sections. The proposed research takes advantage of state-of-the-art algorithms that are emerging in both computer vision and medical imaging and will apply, adapt, and extend them to the specific application of layer segmentation in three-dimensional retinal SD-OCT. Advanced tools for population averaging in a normalized space will also be developed specifically for retinal SD-OCT data. The methods will be validated against manual segmentation and normalization on both normal subjects and patients experiencing retinal degeneration largely associated with thinning of selective layers of the retina. Scans of patients with diseases causing significant retinopathy such as cysts, detachment, or scarring will be evaluated, but further development beyond the present research is expected to be needed to properly segment and quantify such cases. The developed software will be developed within the open-source Java Image Science Toolkit (JIST) framework and released as open source software.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop software for the image analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the retina. Segmentation and quantification of the characteristics of nerve layers within the retina is expected to be of great use on both ophthalmology and neurology, where the retina can be a sensitive indicator of both vision and neurological problems or diseases. Open source software written in a highly portable language will be made available to the research community at the conclusion of the research grant.           The project will develop software for the image analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the retina.

"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.

"Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment toolbox development & evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Advances in digital imaging technologies have led to a substantial growth in the number of digital images being created and stored in hospitals, medical systems, and on the Internet in recent years. Effective medical image retrieval systems can play an important role in teaching, research, diagnosis and treatment. Images were historically retrieved using text-based methods. The quality of annotations associated with images can reduce the effectiveness of text-based image retrieval. Despite recent advances, purely content- based image retrieval techniques lag significantly behind their textual counterparts in their ability to capture the semantic essence of the user's query. Preliminary research suggests that a more promising approach is to adaptively combine these complementary techniques to suit the user and their information needs. However, for these approaches to succeed, the researcher needs to enhance her computational skills in addition to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the relevant clinical domain. This Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) grant application describes a training and career development plan that will allow the candidate, an NLM postdoctoral fellow in Medical Informatics at Oregon Health & Science University to achieve these objectives.

"Image analysis for high-throughput C. elegans infection and metabolism assays    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput screening (HTS) is a technique for searching large libraries of chemical or genetic perturbants, to find new treatments for a disease or to better understand disease pathways. As automated image analysis for cultured cells has improved, microscopy has emerged as one of the most powerful and informative ways to analyze screening samples. However, many diseases and biological pathways can be better studied in whole animals-particularly diseases that involve organ systems and multicellular interactions, such as metabolism and infection. The worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established and effective model organism, used by thousands of researchers worldwide to study complex biological processes. Samples of C. elegans can be robotically prepared and imaged by high-throughput microscopy, but existing image-analysis methods are insuf- ficient for most assays. In this project, image-analysis algorithms that are capable of scoring high-throughput assays of C. elegans will be developed.  The algorithms will be tested and refined in three high-throughput screens, which will uncover chemical and genetic regulators of fat metabolism and infection: (1) A C. elegans viability assay to identify modulators of infection. The proposed algorithms use a probabilistic shape model of C. elegans in order to identify and mea- sure individual worms even when the animals touch or cross. These methods are the basis for quantifying many other phenotypes, including body morphology and subtle variations in reporter signal levels. (2) A C. elegans lipid assay to identify genes that regulate fat metabolism. The algorithms proposed for illumination correction, level-set-based foreground segmentation, well-edge detection, and artifact removal will result in improved or- business in high-throughput experiments. (3) A fluorescence gene expression assay to identify regulators of the response of the C. elegans host to Staphylococcus aureus infection. The proposed techniques for constructing anatomical maps of C. elegans will make it possible to quantify a variety of changes in fluorescent localization patterns in a biologically relevant way.  In addition to discovering new metabolism- and infection-related drugs and genetic regulators through these specific screens, this work will provide the C. elegans community with (a) a new framework for extracting mor- phological features from C. elegans for quantitative analysis of this organism, and (b) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms enabling the discovery of genetic pathways, chemical probes, and drug can- didates in whole organism high-throughput screens relevant to a variety of diseases.  This work is a close collaboration with C. elegans experts Fred Ausubel and Gary Ruvkun at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, with Polina Golland and Tammy Riklin-Raviv, experts in model-based segmentation and statistical image analysis at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and with Anne Carpenter, developer of open-source image analysis software at the Broad Institute.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large-scale screening experiments that test the effects of thousands of chemicals or genetic perturbants by microscopy and image analysis can discover new treatments and help biomedical scientists understand dis- ease mechanisms. Microscopy screens of cultured cells are routine, but researchers wish to study complex processes like metabolism and infection in a whole animal like the tiny worm Caenorhabditis elegans, for which existing image analysis methods are insufficient. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to automatically identify and measure C. elegans in microscopy images, thereby making it possible for researchers worldwide to screen a wide variety of complex biological processes related to human disease.           Large-scale screening experiments that test the effects of thousands of chemicals or genetic perturbants by microscopy and image analysis can discover new treatments and help biomedical scientists understand dis- ease mechanisms.

"Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use light/fluorescence microscopes to image cells and other biological samples. There is strong and growing demand for software to analyze these images, as automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye and the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex.  We have begun to address this demand with CellProfiler, a versatile, open-source software tool for quantifying data from biological images, particularly in high-throughput experiments (www.cellprofiler.org). CellProfiler can extract valuable biological information from images quickly while increasing the objectivity and statistical power of assays. In the three years since its release, it has become widely used, having been downloaded more than 8,000 times by users in over 60 countries. Using CellProfiler's point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized chain of image analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. The software evolved in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  To enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler, we propose to improve its capabilities, interface, and support:  First, we will add user-requested capabilities, leveraging existing open-source projects by interoperating with them where feasible. These new features will include object tracking in time-lapse movies, compatibility with additional file formats, new image processing algorithms, and expanded tools for quality control, performance evaluation, cluster computing, and workflow management.  Second, we will improve the interface, increase processing speed, and simplify the addition of new features by refactoring and porting the MATLAB-based code to an open-source language and instituting proven software development practices.  Third, we will provide user, educator, and developer support and outreach for CellProfiler. These activities will facilitate research in the scientific community and help guide usability improvements.  These improvements to the only open-source software for modular, high-throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from cell images across all disciplines within biology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:           Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and  other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from  microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our user-friendly, open-source cell image  analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org).",Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software,8102722,R01GM089652,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metric', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Process Measure', 'Quality Control', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'cluster computing', 'file format', 'fluorescence microscope', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'movie', 'open source', 'outreach', 'processing speed', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'research study', 'resource guides', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web interface']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2011,458901,0.03982640670321144
"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that advances machine learning algorithms for automatic segmentation and couples these techniques to a scalable tool suite for multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate results.",SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID,8163481,R01NS075314,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computers and Advanced Instrumentation', 'Couples', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Online Systems', 'Organelles', 'Participant', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'biological systems', 'cellular imaging', 'complex biological systems', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'electron optics', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'tomography', 'tool', 'web interface']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2011,459174,0.010536754181324052
"PATHOLOGY MISS RATE RISK REDUCTION IN DIAGNOSTIC SMALL BOWEL CAPSULE ENDOSCOPY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Well trained, experienced gastroenterologists in academic and high volume settings can reliably recognize 97% of pathologies in Capsule Endoscopy (CE) video. However, community physicians and infrequent users may miss up to 20%. The end goal of our proposed new line of research is to develop clinical software that provides automatic decision support to physicians who are trying to declare that a patient is pathology free or has a certain disease process. The risk for the physician - and their patients - is that of a less than optimal clinical outcome due to:  1) missing a lesion/pathology in the video and putting the patient at risk of developing a more serious condition over time, or  2) mistakenly ""identifying"" a pathology that is not present and thus subjecting the patient to unnecessary further diagnostic or surgical procedures.  The research aims in this proposal will enable Ikona to create a pathology prioritization image processing module. Implementing modern machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Adaboost methodologies together with proprietary image feature analysis, this technology will assign a probability metric to every frame in the image sequence for specific pathology (lesions, ulcers, bleeding, etc) and the major landmarks in the GI tract (ileo-cecal valve, pyloric valve etc.). Filtering and sorting endoscopy image data will be done such that the images with the highest probability of containing pathology will be presented to the reviewer first.  This pathology prioritized sequencing is not intended to replace the clinician in the workflow, but rather to allow the clinician to focus more time on frames with a higher potential of containing pathology. Often times, clinically significant pathology may only be present in a single frame. A single ""pathological"" frame in the middle of a 50,000 frame sequence can easily be overlooked by a novice reviewer or a reviewer whose attention is temporarily distracted. With our proposed pathology prioritization, that single pathological frame will be identified and sorted near the beginning of the image sequence thus greatly increasing the likelihood of detection by the reviewer.  Specifically for Phase I, we plan to investigate and develop different algorithms for classifying image frames and recognizing pathological and normal frames, and, algorithms for ranking frames by severity of pathology. Following the implementation of a working prototype, we will further test the clinical utility of these algorithms with human clinical capsule endoscopy videos.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Capsule Endoscopy (CE) is widely used for assessing the small intestine in obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. Experienced gastroenterologists miss 2-3% of pathologies in part due to fatigue from reviewing 50,000 frames per CE video. Less experienced reviewers miss up to 20%. We propose to reduce the risk of false negatives by developing clinical image processing software to automatically re-order the CE video frames, ranking them by the probability they contain pathology.           Capsule Endoscopy (CE) is widely used for assessing the small intestine in obscure gastrointestinal bleeding.

"Digital image analysis for quantitative and qualitative assessment of pig islets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The demonstration by the Edmonton group that human islet transplantation can be successfully used to manage adult type 1 diabetes patients with refractory hypoglycemia has led to increased funding of clinical trials and further research to extend the scope of this therapy by using porcine islets in place of human islets. Significant advances have been made in improving immunosuppression treatment regimens so that results obtained from treating adult diabetic patients with human islet transplants are similar to those obtained after pancreas transplantation. The major hurdle to move this therapy from clinical research to routine clinical practice is to improve the yield and quality of islets recovered from human or porcine pancreas. Presently, there are no standardized methods that can accurately assess the number or quality of islets that are used in the islet transplantation procedures so that results between laboratories can be objectively evaluated. This grant is focused on developing a robust, islet image analysis software to objectively analyze the number and quality of porcine islets recovered from the pancreas. The two major aims of the project are first to develop an improved image analysis software program that will provide a standardized measurement of the number and mass of porcine islets in a cell preparation. And second, enhance the capabilities of the software program by correlating the image signatures of each porcine islet to an artificial category. Porcine islets of similar size will be handpicked and sorted into three categories based on the shape, border, integrity, or uniformity of dithizone staining. The first software enhancement will find those features in the images that can be used to distinguish the different categories of islets. The second enhancement will assess the feasibility of using machine learning methods to correlate these features with data recovered from the images but also other discrete or continuous variables that are used to characterize the porcine islet preparations. If successful, the ability to use a rapid and objective image analysis methodology will improve the assessment of the number and quality of islets within and between laboratories; correlate image features with success of transplantation as measured by graft survival and insulin independence; and improve the islet isolation methods to achieve favorable islet image scores that are determined by retrospective analysis. The ability of a commercial firm focused on improving islet yields by focusing on tissue dissociation with a leading academic laboratory that has sophisticated expertise in developing software algorithms from microscopic images provides a fresh approach to a difficult medical that needs to be resolved to realize the full potential of islet transplantation to treat adult type 1 diabetic patients.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An objective, reliable and accurate method for the assessment of islet quantity and quality is paramount to the standardization and subsequent success of islet transplantation as a treatment for type 1 diabetes. Conventional manual methods for determining islet yields using an optical microscope with a calibrated eyepiece reticule are subjective, time consuming and often overestimate islet mass due to sampling errors and erroneous assumptions in the conversion of islet numbers to islet equivalents. The research proposed will utilize recent advances in digital image analysis, including machine learning and pattern recognition, to develop a software algorithm for the rapid characterization of islets destined for transplantation procedures.           An objective, reliable and accurate method for the assessment of islet quantity and quality is paramount to the standardization and subsequent success of islet transplantation as a treatment for type 1 diabetes.

"Objective imaging-based assessment of smoking behavior from used filters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate measurement of smoking behaviors and exposures may become critical as FDA implements its authority to regulate tobacco products, and in particular proposes product standards and considers approval of modified risk products. Recently, digital image analysis systems have been developed that can identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters with high accuracy and can also estimate the degree of smoker compensation. There is strong potential for such digital imaging systems to unobtrusively infer a rich set of smoker topography variables as well as a smoker's exposure to toxins. The existing literature base on filter-based assays is growing and points to growing prominence and applicability of these approaches to important research questions. We propose to modify existing analysis systems and conduct a series of studies to test their reliability, validity, and applicability for determining mouth- level cigarette smoke exposure by examining tar stains on cigarette filter butts. The Specific Aims are designed to provide rigorous evaluations of the utility of the systems, from establishing prediction equations using machine-smoked cigarettes to cross- validation in human-smoked samples against other established measures of mouth-level exposure. At the conclusion of this project, we plan to release a validated suite of software to the research community to support external verification of digital image analysis for smoking-related research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Accurately and simply measuring smoking behavior and smoke exposure is important, and digital image analysis systems have been developed that can estimate smoke intake and identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters. The proposed project will modify existing analysis systems and conduct a series of studies to test their reliability, validity, and applicability for determining mouth-level cigarette smoke exposure. We plan to make a suite of software publicly available to allow others to apply this technology in their own research.                 Accurately and simply measuring smoking behavior and smoke exposure is important, and digital image analysis systems have been developed that can estimate smoke intake and identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters.

"Developing a Platform for Prediction of Metastasis Using Multiplexed QD-imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiplexed biomarker analysis is more powerful in reflecting the biological behaviors of a tumor than single biomarker analysis, but its standardization and quantification is still a challenge. Furthermore, most computer software does not provide methods for imaging and analyzing subcellular localization of biomarkers and correlating them with biological and clinical information. The objective of this project is to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantification of multiplexed immunostaining plus bioinformatics for the prediction of lymph node metastases (LNM) from the primary tumor (PT) of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). LNM of SCCHN is a precisely defined biological phenomenon which is an ideal model to be utilized to develop this multiplexed biomarker platform (MBP). Based on our preliminary studies, we aim to test the hypothesis that that the MBP can be developed to identify the subcellular distribution and expression of multiple metastasis-related biomarkers simultaneously in PTs. Accurate quantification of these biomarkers will facilitate the prediction of metastasis from PTs. Three emerging technologies, quantum dot (QD)-based immunohistofluorescence (IHF), multispectral imaging, and machine learning will be used to test this hypothesis. Using these approaches, a platform that combines quantifying multiplexed immunostaining with biostatistics will be developed and tested for its sensitivity, specificity, and prediction power for use in the clinic. Therefore, this project fits appropriately to the scope of the NCI program announcement ""Developmental Research in Cancer Prognosis and Prediction"" (PA-09-159).  Three aims are proposed in the study. (1) To develop a multiplexed biomarker system and method based on a bulk tissue model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissues. This Aim will establish and validate an analysis methodology for multiplexed quantification of membrane and cytoplasmic staining using a new function in InForm software where subcellular localization of certain biomarkers will be specifically analyzed. Prediction of LNM based on this bulk tissue model will be achieved. (2) To develop a per-cell quantification method based on a sub-population model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissue.  The per-cell analysis results will quantified as the percentage of high risk cells from the multiplexed biomarker analyses in the same PTs. The high risk population will be correlated with LNM. The sensitivity and specificity of the prediction by the sub-population model will be compared with that of the bulk tissue model. (3) To develop and validate a nomogram with software combining clinical characterizations of metastasis as a working platform for the prediction of LNM. While the primary endpoint of Aim 1 and 2 is to correlate the three biomarkers with metastasis, other clinical factors such as differentiation status, tumor stage, and site, etc. may also correlate with LNM. The most predictive biomarker set combined with relevant clinical factors will constitute a platform with computer software that will be validated in an additional 100 SCCHN samples for prediction of LNM.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging and quantifying expression and subcellular localization of multiplexed biomarkers is currently a challenge in cancer research and clinical application. This project aims to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantifying multiplexed biomarkers plus their correlation with lymph node metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

"Cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in biopsies via spectral imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This is a Fast-Track application to provide reliable, cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in cancer biopsies to assist pharmaceutical drug development and provision of patient-specific prognosis and therapy guidance (""personalized medicine""). The organizing theme is that the appropriate unit of analysis should be the individual cell as opposed to averaged tumor extracts. To this end, novel technologies will be coupled with careful methods-development. Spectral imaging and advanced image analysis tools will permit multi-target immunohistochemical (IHC) and/or immunofluorescence (IF) detection, at the cellular and subcellular level in intact tissue sections. CRi-developed image processing and machine-learning tools provide automation and sophisticated quantitation options. Multiplexed staining protocols will yield independent, potentially stoichiometric labeling with combined IHC and IF. The sensitivity of all potential markers to variations in tissue handling will be carefully assessed; some may be robust and suitable for archival tissue studies, others will be too labile. Ultrasound-assisted fixation will be tested for its ability to preserve such labile epitopes for use in prospectively acquired tissues. Four or more pathway-related proteins will be detected in tissue sections, on a cell-by-cell basis, even if co-localized and with spectrally overlapping labels. The coordinated subcellular location of the pathway molecules will be also tracked, with simultaneous assessment of cell-surface receptors (e.g., EGFR, VEGF, Her2-neu), downstream signaling proteins and phosphoproteins (e.g., pAKT, pERK), nuclear proteins (e.g., ER, Ki67), and novel players such as protein-folding mediators (e.g. BIP1).       The project will combine optimized tissue protocols, multiplexed IHC/IF reagent kits, and unique machine- learning image analysis that can be used to automate region-detection and label-quantitation. All these depend on CRi's multispectral imaging approaches for assessing multiple analytes on a cell-by-cell and cell- compartment basis in tissue sections. Our collaborators will provide small-animal tumor models for early methods development, multiplexed immunohistochemical labeling of pathway proteins in clinical cancer biopsies, access to archived and prospectively acquired tissues from pathway-targeting clinical drug trials, highly informative archival tissue microarrays, access to validated, activation-specific antibodies, ultra-fast tissue fixation, and biostatistics support. The ""deliverable"" will be a suite of products suitable for clinical use that can provide much-needed valid information on single-cell-based pathway status in an intact tissue context to support pharmaceutical drug development efforts and provide molecularly focused patient care.       Significance and lay narrative: The ability to quantitatively evaluate multiple molecular targets and pathways on a cell-by-cell basis, in a single preparation of clinical tissue, is missing from the current toolbox of personalized medicine, which lacks good means of matching novel drugs and drug candidates to specific patients. Conventional molecular pathology methods are typically limited to a single immunohistochemical (IHC) test on a given tissue section or to expensive and time-consuming proteomics or expression-array approaches (which cannot directly report out pathway activation status in cancer cell populations and subpopulations). Multiplexed IHC (including immuno-fluorescence) combined with optimized sample handling protocols to retain pathway proteins and advanced image analysis will enable the unambiguous detection of active signaling pathways, benefiting pharmaceutical research in the selection of patients for better targeted trials and in the monitoring of response, and clinical practice for diagnosis, therapy selection, and monitoring response (i.e., theranostics).          n/a",Cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in biopsies via spectral imaging,8019130,R44CA130026,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Avastin', 'BAY 54-9085', 'BIK gene', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'British Columbia', 'CD34 gene', 'Calibration', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cells', 'Certification', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Correlative Study', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'Employment', 'Energy Transfer', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Fixatives', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nuclear Antigens', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Focused Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Reagent', 'Receptor Activation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Roche brand of trastuzumab', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Tissue Fixation', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transillumination', 'Translating', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Weight', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'clinical material', 'clinical practice', 'commercialization', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'lapatinib', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'member', 'method development', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'molecular pathology', 'mouse model', 'nanoparticle', 'new technology', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'prospective', 'protein expression', 'protein folding', 'research study', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'statistics', 'subcutaneous', 'theranostics', 'tissue culture', 'tissue processing', 'tissue/cell culture', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH AND INSTRUMENTATION,R44,2011,783061,-0.026299743502101375
"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers. The application is optimization of a parallel-hole collimator design for In-111 NET imaging.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomog- raphy (SPECT) has a significant role in cancer diagnosis and management.

"New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging has become a standard component of modern cardiology. In SPECT research (as in medical imaging generally), it has become widely accepted that advances in imaging hardware and algorithms should be guided by so-called task-based evaluation criteria, i.e., measures that reflect how the imaging technique will impact clinical decision making. In general, a human observer study is the gold standard for measuring task-based criteria; however, the expense and complexity of such studies precludes their routine use. Therefore, numerical observers-algorithms that emulate human observer performance-are now widely used as surrogates for human observers. In SPECT, one particular numerical observer, known as the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), has come to dominate the field. The CHO is a detection algorithm that is used to approximate the human observer's performance in detecting lesions; in the case of cardiac SPECT, the lesions of interest are perfusion defects. An imaging system or algorithm can be judged by the ability of the CHO to accurately detect defects based on the images produced. SPECT researchers now rely heavily (and sometimes exclusively) on numerical observers such as the CHO, not only to validate their final results, but also as a figure of merit that guides optimization of hardware or algorithms. Because of the central role it has come to play, the CHO and its extensions have become a major research topic in their own right. In the proposed project, our goal will be to create a suite of numerical observers that will shed light on a much wider set of clinical tasks than the CHO, and we will pursue an approach that we hypothesize will be more accurate than the CHO. Therefore, the proposed research is significant because it will yield an evaluation methodology that could potentially be used very widely by the research community, underpinning the development of imaging hardware and software. We will develop a software package for image quality assessment using the proposed NO approach and distribute it freely to the research community. As a by-product of the research, the proposed project will also yield a thorough task-based evaluation of major image reconstruction algorithms, and will answer the question of which sorts of data (on the spectrum from simple phantoms to clinical data) are a sufficient foundation for numerical observers to perform as desired. The research will also yield the basis for a potential computer aided diagnostic system for cardiology. The specific aims of the research will be as follows: 1) Create a comprehensive set of imaging data and human observer scores; 2) Develop a suite of numerical observers based on our novel learning-based approach, as well as more-conventional statistical decision theory principles; 3) Compare and evaluate the numerical observers; and 4) Develop and disseminate by-products of the research program.          n/a",New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology,8037095,R01HL091017,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Viability', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer program', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'standard measure', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2011,417204,0.008330658958951674
"A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis SUMMARY The requirement for a trained user to interact with tissue and images is a long-standing impediment to higher throughput analysis of biological microstructures using unbiased stereology, the state-of-the-art method for accurate quantification of biological structure. Phase 1 studies addressed this limitation with Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis (VCS), an innovative approach for automatic stereological analysis that improves throughput efficiency by 6-9 fold compared to conventional computerized stereology. Work in Phase 2 integrated VCS into the Stereologer"", an integrated hardware-software-microscopy system for stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images. Validation studies of first-order stereological parameters. i.e., volume, surface area, length, number, confirmed that the color-based detection methods in the VCS approach achieve accurate results for automatic stereological analysis of high S:N biological microstructures. These studies indicate that fully automatic stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images can be realized by elimination of two remaining barriers, which will be addressed in this Phase II Continuation Competing Renewal. In Aim 1, applications for feature extraction and microstructure classification, developed in part with funding from the Office of Naval Research, will be integrated into the VCS program. The new application (VCS II) will use these approaches to automatically detect and classify polymorphic microstructures of biological interest using a range of feature calculations, including size, color, border, shape, and texture, with support from active learning and Support Vector Machines. Work in Aim 2 will eliminate physical handling of glass slides during computerized stereology studies by equipping the Stereologer system with automatic slide loading/unloading technology controlled by the Stereologer system. This technology will approximately double the throughput efficiency of the current VCS program and support ""human-in-the-loop"" interaction for sample microstructures on the border between two or more adjacent classes. The studies in Aim 3 will rigorously test the hypothesis that fully automatic VCS can quantify first- and second-order stereological parameters, without a loss of accuracy compared to the current gold-standard - non-automatic computerized stereology, e.g., manual Stereologer. If these studies validate the accuracy of VCS II, then commercialization of the fully automatic program will facilitate the throughout efficiency for testing scientific hypotheses in a wide variety of biomedical research projects; reduce labor costs for computerized stereology studies; hasten the growth of our understanding of biological processes that underlie health, longevity, and disease; and accelerate the development of novel approaches for the therapeutic management of human disease. Solid evidence that the SRC and its strategic partners can effectively commercialize this technology is demonstrated by their worldwide sales and support of the Stereologer system for the past 13 years.

"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.              Synopsis  Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs.

"Human-Centered Perceptual and Conceptual Classification of Biomedical Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity and importance yet effective computing solutions for managing images and understanding their content are lacking. Image understanding is a key limiting factor in advancing these endeavors. Major challenges remain in understanding the capabilities of the human visual system with respect to biomedical imaging and in extracting and utilizing tacit knowledge of domain experts. To meet these challenges, we propose an innovative, multidisciplinary approach which combines methods of user centered design, visual perception and computer imaging research to interact with domain experts and to elicit and use their extrinsic and intrinsic knowledge. We will use a novel contextual design approach to inspection of dermatology images to discover relationships between perceptually- relevant visual content of images and users' conceptual understanding as expressed through natural language. Analysis of users' eye movements and verbal descriptions, together with mapping to domain medical ontologies, will allow us to integrate visual data with a user-specified language model to define perceptual categories and inform image classification. This is a fundamental and challenging data to knowledge problem that has not been solved. This study will provide proof of concept of the value of eliciting tacit knowledge from domain experts through multiple perceptually relevant modes in order to integrate data and knowledge models for better image understanding and may help enact a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize and develop biomedical information systems, in general.             Project Narrative Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity yet their usefulness for research, medicine, and teaching is limited by the design of current computing systems. Discoveries and concrete advances made in this study will contribute to solutions for effective use of digital images-a problem that is central to research and application across science, technology, and medicine. Advancements in our understanding of the design of useful and usable information systems will benefit society at large and contribute to the public health.

"Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment, toolbox development & evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Advances in digital imaging technologies have led to a substantial growth in the number of digital images being created and stored in hospitals, medical systems, and on the Internet in recent years. Effective medical image retrieval systems can play an important role in teaching, research, diagnosis and treatment. Images were historically retrieved using text-based methods. The quality of annotations associated with images can reduce the effectiveness of text-based image retrieval. Despite recent advances, purely content- based image retrieval techniques lag significantly behind their textual counterparts in their ability to capture the semantic essence of the user's query. Preliminary research suggests that a more promising approach is to adaptively combine these complementary techniques to suit the user and their information needs. However, for these approaches to succeed, the researcher needs to enhance her computational skills in addition to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the relevant clinical domain. This Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) grant application describes a training and career development plan that will allow the candidate, an NLM postdoctoral fellow in Medical Informatics at Oregon Health & Science University to achieve these objectives. The training component will be carried out under the mentorship of Dr. W. Hersh with Dr. Gorman (user studies). Dr. Fuss (radiation medicine) and Dr. Erdogmus (machine learning) providing additional mentoring in their areas of expertise.       The long-term goal of this Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) project is to improve visual information retrieval by better understanding user needs and proposing adaptive methodologies for multimodal image retrieval that will close the semantic gap. During the award period, activities will be focused on the following specific aims: (1) Understand the image retrieval needs of novice and expert users in radiation oncology and develop gold standards for evaluation; (2) Develop algorithms for semantic, multimodal image retrieval; (3) Perform user based evaluation of adaptive image retrieval in radiation oncology; (4) Extend the techniques developed to create a multimodal image retrieval system in pathology          n/a","Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment, toolbox development & evaluation",7921476,K99LM009889,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Award', 'Back', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Distance Learning', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image retrieval system', 'Imaging technology', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric System', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Oregon', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer site', 'care delivery', 'career development', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'improved', 'meetings', 'oncology', 'open source', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'visual information']",NLM,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K99,2010,110591,0.049326318929795096
"Robust BCT for Clinical Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a major public health threat for over 50% of the population over age 50. Despite its importance, osteoporosis is largely under-treated, with less than 20% of those recommended for testing being screened. With substantial reimbursement cuts being introduced by Medicare for bone densitometry by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, the current clinical standard), with a sensitivity of DXA for fracture prediction of less than 50%, and with the rapidly increasing size of the aging population of the U.S., there is an urgent need for additional and more sensitive modalities than DXA for clinical assessment of fracture risk. Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) has emerged as a powerful alternative to DXA. This CT-based technology creates a structural ""finite element"" model of a patient's bone from their CT scans, and subjects that model to virtual forces in order to provide an estimate of the strength of the bone. Well validated in cadaver studies and being a better predictor of bone strength than is bone mineral density by DXA, BCT has also been shown to be highly predictive of osteoporotic fractures in clinical research studies. However, robustness remains an issue - can the technique be used easily by non-experts in research and clinical environments? Addressing this issue, the overall goal of this research is to improve the robustness of our software, such that it can automatically analyze scans from a wide range of CT scanners and using a wide variety of CT acquisition protocols, including new low-dose protocols that limit radiation exposure to the patient. Such a robust BCT diagnostic tool could then be offered as a supplementary ""add-on"" analysis to many types of CT exams taken for other purposes such as CT colonography, pelvic, abdominal, and spine exams, thus reducing hospital costs, incurring no addition radiation to the patient, requiring no change in the CT acquisition protocols, and therefore greatly increasing the number of patients that could be screened at low cost. Specifically, we propose in this Phase-I project to combine expertise in computer vision, CT scanning, and biomechanics in order to develop an automated method of ""phantomless"" cross-calibration of CT scans for robust vertebral strength assessment. Focusing on the spine, our major tasks are to perform a series of clinical studies in which patients are scanned twice using a variety of CT acquisition protocols; develop a custom external-calibration phantom and use that to determine the effects of various CT acquisition parameters on scanning standardization; and use machine learning techniques to develop a ""statistical atlas"" of the spine for automation of all image processing. We will combine these efforts to develop a phantomless BCT method that accounts for differences in image quality due to variations in CT scanners and acquisition protocols, including low-dose protocols, and that does so in a highly automated fashion requiring minimal user expertise and input. Should this project be successful, future work will further refine the techniques, extend them to the hip and quantitative analysis of muscle and other soft tissues, and address robustness of longitudinal changes for clinical monitoring.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With a mortality rate up to 30% one year after hip fracture, and an economic burden exceeding $17 billion annually, osteoporotic fracture is a debilitating condition whose impact on our aging society is growing. Early identification of those at risk for fracture can guide prevention and treatment, and BCT will provide a means for such detection with a sensitivity and specificity lacking in DXA based bone densitometry. The greater radiation exposure from CT, however, limits the market for such a diagnostic. The proposed project will result in a robust diagnostic test that significantly lowers radiation dose to the patient, and in some implementations, completely eliminates additional radiation by using CT scans already ordered for other medical purposes. Successful development of this product will broaden the pool of individuals who will benefit from a more accurate and sensitive fracture risk prediction, expand the market for O. N. Diagnostics' business, and result in an important advance in the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.           Statement of Relevance With a mortality rate up to 30% one year after hip fracture, and an economic burden exceeding $17 billion annually, osteoporotic fracture is a debilitating condition whose impact on our aging society is growing.

"Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use light/fluorescence microscopes to image cells and other biological samples. There is strong and growing demand for software to analyze these images, as automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye and the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex.  We have begun to address this demand with CellProfiler, a versatile, open-source software tool for quantifying data from biological images, particularly in high-throughput experiments (www.cellprofiler.org). CellProfiler can extract valuable biological information from images quickly while increasing the objectivity and statistical power of assays. In the three years since its release, it has become widely used, having been downloaded more than 8,000 times by users in over 60 countries. Using CellProfiler's point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized chain of image analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. The software evolved in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  To enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler, we propose to improve its capabilities, interface, and support:  First, we will add user-requested capabilities, leveraging existing open-source projects by interoperating with them where feasible. These new features will include object tracking in time-lapse movies, compatibility with additional file formats, new image processing algorithms, and expanded tools for quality control, performance evaluation, cluster computing, and workflow management.  Second, we will improve the interface, increase processing speed, and simplify the addition of new features by refactoring and porting the MATLAB-based code to an open-source language and instituting proven software development practices.  Third, we will provide user, educator, and developer support and outreach for CellProfiler. These activities will facilitate research in the scientific community and help guide usability improvements.  These improvements to the only open-source software for modular, high-throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from cell images across all disciplines within biology. Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and  other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from  microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our user-friendly, open-source cell image  analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org).",Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software,7761085,R01GM089652,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metric', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Process Measure', 'Quality Control', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'cluster computing', 'file format', 'fluorescence microscope', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'movie', 'open source', 'outreach', 'processing speed', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'research study', 'resource guides', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web interface']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2010,463608,0.039750116009881216
"A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A decade ago when microarray was first invented, it was hailed as ""an array of hope"" in Nature Genetics and has received a considerable amount of attention in biomedicine. Subsequently it has been called ""an array of problems"" in Nature Review. An inherent problem with microarray gene expression is that structural information is missing, which limits its ability in biological discovery. To overcome the poor reproducibility and accuracy of microarray imaging, there needs to be a shift in fundamental paradigms to those able to incorporate complementary and multiscale structural imaging information into microarray imaging. Fortunately, the latest progress in high resolution biomolecular imaging probe development coupled with advanced image analysis makes integrative and systematic studies of cellular systems possible. A cell can be labeled using multiscale and multimodality imaging, providing both structural and functional information. With multiscale imaging spreadsheets now available, there is an overwhelming need within the life sciences community to manage this information effectively, to analyze it comprehensively, and to apply the resulting knowledge in the understanding of the genetic system of a cell. However, the management and mining of this large-scale imaging information is limited by today's computational approaches and knowledge-sharing infrastructure. These problems represent a major impediment to progress in the emerging area of bio-molecular image informatics. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a unique genomic image management and mining system that can allow geneticists to search, correlate and integrate this multiscale and multi-modality imaging information in an easily operable fashion and further enable new biological discovery. In particular, this system will fill a void left in the current image database systems such as Open Microscope Environment (OME), e.g., the lack of analytic tools for integrative data analysis. To realize this goal, we are bringing together a strong interdisciplinary team consisting of imaging engineers, geneticists and industrial imaging scientists. Building on our diverse and complementary expertise, we are able to provide innovative and interdisciplinary approaches that combine the latest progress in image processing, imaging database design and machine learning with the development of high resolution and high throughput molecular imaging probes in genomics. More specifically, we will accomplish the following specific aims. First, we will develop a suite of algorithms for content extraction and information retrieval from high resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) images. This visual system will effectively manage imaging phenotype information, facilitating knowledge discovery such as identifying visually similar subtypes. Second, we will correlate quantitative traits extracted from FISH imaging with genomic structural rearrangements and gene expression patterns. Finally, we will develop a data integration approach to fuse disparate information from multi-modality imaging databases for improved characterization of biological systems.               Public Health Relevance Statement The anticipated outcome of the project will include a publicly accessible imaging database analysis system to facilitate multiscale genomic image information integration and knowledge mining. The proposed approach challenges the current paradigm by the integration of high resolution structural imaging with functional information, which promises to overcome the poor accuracy and reproducibility problems plagued with microarray imaging. Given the ubiquitous use of microarray imaging in biomedicine, the project is thus expected to be of great impact on the biomedical community.",A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets,7845601,R21LM010042,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Blast Cell', 'Cells', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Comb animal structure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Coupled', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'Hybridization Array', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Karyotype', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Microscope', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Prevention', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biological systems', 'complex biological systems', 'data integration', 'database design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder prevention', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'image processing', 'imaging informatics', 'imaging modality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'knowledge of results', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'mutant', 'public health relevance', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'trait', 'visual map']",NLM,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R21,2010,186306,0.03767817148363998
"Cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in biopsies via spectral imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This is a Fast-Track application to provide reliable, cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in cancer biopsies to assist pharmaceutical drug development and provision of patient-specific prognosis and therapy guidance (""personalized medicine""). The organizing theme is that the appropriate unit of analysis should be the individual cell as opposed to averaged tumor extracts. To this end, novel technologies will be coupled with careful methods-development. Spectral imaging and advanced image analysis tools will permit multi-target immunohistochemical (IHC) and/or immunofluorescence (IF) detection, at the cellular and subcellular level in intact tissue sections. CRi-developed image processing and machine-learning tools provide automation and sophisticated quantitation options. Multiplexed staining protocols will yield independent, potentially stoichiometric labeling with combined IHC and IF. The sensitivity of all potential markers to variations in tissue handling will be carefully assessed; some may be robust and suitable for archival tissue studies, others will be too labile. Ultrasound-assisted fixation will be tested for its ability to preserve such labile epitopes for use in prospectively acquired tissues. Four or more pathway-related proteins will be detected in tissue sections, on a cell-by-cell basis, even if co-localized and with spectrally overlapping labels. The coordinated subcellular location of the pathway molecules will be also tracked, with simultaneous assessment of cell-surface receptors (e.g., EGFR, VEGF, Her2-neu), downstream signaling proteins and phosphoproteins (e.g., pAKT, pERK), nuclear proteins (e.g., ER, Ki67), and novel players such as protein-folding mediators (e.g. BIP1).       The project will combine optimized tissue protocols, multiplexed IHC/IF reagent kits, and unique machine- learning image analysis that can be used to automate region-detection and label-quantitation. All these depend on CRi's multispectral imaging approaches for assessing multiple analytes on a cell-by-cell and cell- compartment basis in tissue sections. Our collaborators will provide small-animal tumor models for early methods development, multiplexed immunohistochemical labeling of pathway proteins in clinical cancer biopsies, access to archived and prospectively acquired tissues from pathway-targeting clinical drug trials, highly informative archival tissue microarrays, access to validated, activation-specific antibodies, ultra-fast tissue fixation, and biostatistics support. The ""deliverable"" will be a suite of products suitable for clinical use that can provide much-needed valid information on single-cell-based pathway status in an intact tissue context to support pharmaceutical drug development efforts and provide molecularly focused patient care.       Significance and lay narrative: The ability to quantitatively evaluate multiple molecular targets and pathways on a cell-by-cell basis, in a single preparation of clinical tissue, is missing from the current toolbox of personalized medicine, which lacks good means of matching novel drugs and drug candidates to specific patients. Conventional molecular pathology methods are typically limited to a single immunohistochemical (IHC) test on a given tissue section or to expensive and time-consuming proteomics or expression-array approaches (which cannot directly report out pathway activation status in cancer cell populations and subpopulations).

AOM represents a bacterial super infection of the middle ear fluid and OME a sterile effusion that tends to subside spontaneously. Antibiotics are generally beneficial only for AOM. Accurate diagnosis of AOM, as well as distinction from both OME and no effusion (NOE) requires considerable training.  AOM is the most common infection for which antimicrobial agents are prescribed for children in the US. By age seven, 93 percent of children will have experienced one or more episodes of otitis media.1 AOM results in significant social burden and indirect costs due to time lost from school and work. Estimated direct costs of AOM in 1995 were $1.96 billion and indirect costs were estimated to be $1.02 billion, with a total of 20 million prescriptions for antimicrobials related to otitis media.2 Given these considerations, our goal is to:  Develop a software tool to classify images into one of three stringent clinical diagnostic categories (AOM/OME/NOE), and validate the algorithm on tympanic membrane (TM) images.  We have assembled a strong multidisciplinary team that can successfully develop an automated diagnostic algorithm in this Phase-I program. We have (1) gathered a team of nationally-recognized otoscopists with substantial clinical and research experience in the context of AOM clinical trials; (2) studied the predictive value of diagnostic findings in discriminating AOM from OME from NOE; (3) acquired a large number of TM images from children; and (4) involved an internationally recognized expert in developing algorithms in all areas of image analysis and processing.  In the planned Phase-II, we will use the algorithm developed in the Phase-I program and incorporate it into a user-friendly and marketable digital otoscope-software platform that can be used at the point-of-care by clinicians to improve the care of children with this frequently occurring condition. This will be followed by a clinical trial evaluating its immediate impact on clinical care, and, in particular, utilization of antimicrobials.  Our main goal will be to develop an accurate automated algorithm for classifying the three diagnostic categories (AOM/OME/NOE). We aim to achieve an overall accuracy of 95 percent by applying a newly developed classification algorithm. This will include applying state-of-the-art classification methods as well as segmentation algorithms, for automated, robust diagnosis and classification of the three diagnostic categories (AOM/OME/NOE). We propose to achieve this through the following two specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop a robust and accurate diagnostic algorithm that can discriminate TM digital images into 1of 3 stringent diagnostic categories (AOM/OME/NOE).  Specific Aim 2: Validate the algorithm on a dataset that includes over 2000 TM images collected in a recently completed NIAID-sponsored clinical trial.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    AOM is the most common infection for which antimicrobial agents are prescribed in children in the US.

"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers. The application is optimization of a parallel-hole collimator design for In-111 NET imaging.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomog- raphy (SPECT) has a significant role in cancer diagnosis and management.

"New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging has become a standard component of modern cardiology. In SPECT research (as in medical imaging generally), it has become widely accepted that advances in imaging hardware and algorithms should be guided by so-called task-based evaluation criteria, i.e., measures that reflect how the imaging technique will impact clinical decision making. In general, a human observer study is the gold standard for measuring task-based criteria; however, the expense and complexity of such studies precludes their routine use. Therefore, numerical observers-algorithms that emulate human observer performance-are now widely used as surrogates for human observers. In SPECT, one particular numerical observer, known as the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), has come to dominate the field. The CHO is a detection algorithm that is used to approximate the human observer's performance in detecting lesions; in the case of cardiac SPECT, the lesions of interest are perfusion defects. An imaging system or algorithm can be judged by the ability of the CHO to accurately detect defects based on the images produced. SPECT researchers now rely heavily (and sometimes exclusively) on numerical observers such as the CHO, not only to validate their final results, but also as a figure of merit that guides optimization of hardware or algorithms. Because of the central role it has come to play, the CHO and its extensions have become a major research topic in their own right. In the proposed project, our goal will be to create a suite of numerical observers that will shed light on a much wider set of clinical tasks than the CHO, and we will pursue an approach that we hypothesize will be more accurate than the CHO. Therefore, the proposed research is significant because it will yield an evaluation methodology that could potentially be used very widely by the research community, underpinning the development of imaging hardware and software. We will develop a software package for image quality assessment using the proposed NO approach and distribute it freely to the research community. As a by-product of the research, the proposed project will also yield a thorough task-based evaluation of major image reconstruction algorithms, and will answer the question of which sorts of data (on the spectrum from simple phantoms to clinical data) are a sufficient foundation for numerical observers to perform as desired. The research will also yield the basis for a potential computer aided diagnostic system for cardiology. The specific aims of the research will be as follows: 1) Create a comprehensive set of imaging data and human observer scores; 2) Develop a suite of numerical observers based on our novel learning-based approach, as well as more-conventional statistical decision theory principles; 3) Compare and evaluate the numerical observers; and 4) Develop and disseminate by-products of the research program.          n/a",New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology,7769507,R01HL091017,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Viability', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer program', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'standard measure', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2010,420313,0.008330658958951674
"Spatially Accurate Deformable Image Registration for Thoracic CT Application    DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant)   Abstract:  Deformable image registration (DIR) is a cross-cutting technology with diagnostic and therapeutic medical applications. DIR algorithms were first developed in computer vision research to estimate motion between a source and target image, the resulting registered image visually appears similar to the target image. For medical applications the goal in applying DIR is to obtain an accurate spatial registration of the underlying anatomy and not simply image similarity. We developed a statistical framework for quantitative evaluation of DIR spatial accuracy based on large samples of expert-determined landmark features. Central to this framework is the statistical relationship between the number of landmark points required to assess spatial accuracy, the desired uncertainty range of the mean error, and an a priori estimated behavior of the DIR. DIR is at the heart of our strategy to quantify COPD small airway disease air-trapping and four dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) ventilation. The optimal DIR algorithm and its spatial accuracy in registering the underlying anatomy should be assessed for each application. We will develop and test new DIR algorithms for exhale and inhale breath-hold CT (eBH-CT & iBH-CT) images pairs (COPD air trapping evaluation) and for 4D CT images (4D CT ventilation). Current CT image analysis methods for COPD evaluation focus on the separate anatomic evaluation of the eBH-CT & iBH-CT images. They are unable to find air-trapping due to bronchiolitis alone. We propose to evaluate the eBH- & iBH CT image pairs simultaneously using DIR to link the two to identify regions of air-trapping due to both emphysema and bronchiolitis. Next, to continue our development of ventilation imaging derived from 4D CT, we will test the ability of 4D CT ventilation image guidance to reduce pulmonary function loss after radiotherapy in a randomized phase II trial for non-small cell lung cancer patients.   Public Health Relevance:  This study will develop novel image registration methods and their application, with an emphasis on application specific validation. With this technology we will develop and test methods to find air-trapping in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. We will test our novel ventilation imaging method in radiation treatment planning to reduce normal lung injury after treatment for lung cancer.       n/a",Spatially Accurate Deformable Image Registration for Thoracic CT Application,7980382,DP2OD007044,"['Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Behavior', 'Breathing', 'Bronchiolitis', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Exhalation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Link', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision research', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abstracting', 'base', 'image registration', 'pulmonary function', 'small airways disease']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,DP2,2010,1645038,0.00015638746847606135
"A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis SUMMARY The requirement for a trained user to interact with tissue and images is a long-standing impediment to higher throughput analysis of biological microstructures using unbiased stereology, the state-of-the-art method for accurate quantification of biological structure. Phase 1 studies addressed this limitation with Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis (VCS), an innovative approach for automatic stereological analysis that improves throughput efficiency by 6-9 fold compared to conventional computerized stereology. Work in Phase 2 integrated VCS into the Stereologer"", an integrated hardware-software-microscopy system for stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images. Validation studies of first-order stereological parameters. i.e., volume, surface area, length, number, confirmed that the color-based detection methods in the VCS approach achieve accurate results for automatic stereological analysis of high S:N biological microstructures. These studies indicate that fully automatic stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images can be realized by elimination of two remaining barriers, which will be addressed in this Phase II Continuation Competing Renewal. In Aim 1, applications for feature extraction and microstructure classification, developed in part with funding from the Office of Naval Research, will be integrated into the VCS program. The new application (VCS II) will use these approaches to automatically detect and classify polymorphic microstructures of biological interest using a range of feature calculations, including size, color, border, shape, and texture, with support from active learning and Support Vector Machines. Work in Aim 2 will eliminate physical handling of glass slides during computerized stereology studies by equipping the Stereologer system with automatic slide loading/unloading technology controlled by the Stereologer system. This technology will approximately double the throughput efficiency of the current VCS program and support ""human-in-the-loop"" interaction for sample microstructures on the border between two or more adjacent classes. The studies in Aim 3 will rigorously test the hypothesis that fully automatic VCS can quantify first- and second-order stereological parameters, without a loss of accuracy compared to the current gold-standard - non-automatic computerized stereology, e.g., manual Stereologer. If these studies validate the accuracy of VCS II, then commercialization of the fully automatic program will facilitate the throughout efficiency for testing scientific hypotheses in a wide variety of biomedical research projects; reduce labor costs for computerized stereology studies; hasten the growth of our understanding of biological processes that underlie health, longevity, and disease; and accelerate the development of novel approaches for the therapeutic management of human disease. Solid evidence that the SRC and its strategic partners can effectively commercialize this technology is demonstrated by their worldwide sales and support of the Stereologer system for the past 13 years.

"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.              Synopsis  Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy.

"Human-Centered Perceptual and Conceptual Classification of Biomedical Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity and importance yet effective computing solutions for managing images and understanding their content are lacking. Image understanding is a key limiting factor in advancing these endeavors. Major challenges remain in understanding the capabilities of the human visual system with respect to biomedical imaging and in extracting and utilizing tacit knowledge of domain experts. To meet these challenges, we propose an innovative, multidisciplinary approach which combines methods of user centered design, visual perception and computer imaging research to interact with domain experts and to elicit and use their extrinsic and intrinsic knowledge. We will use a novel contextual design approach to inspection of dermatology images to discover relationships between perceptually- relevant visual content of images and users' conceptual understanding as expressed through natural language. Analysis of users' eye movements and verbal descriptions, together with mapping to domain medical ontologies, will allow us to integrate visual data with a user-specified language model to define perceptual categories and inform image classification. This is a fundamental and challenging data to knowledge problem that has not been solved. This study will provide proof of concept of the value of eliciting tacit knowledge from domain experts through multiple perceptually relevant modes in order to integrate data and knowledge models for better image understanding and may help enact a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize and develop biomedical information systems, in general.             Project Narrative Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity yet their usefulness for research, medicine, and teaching is limited by the design of current computing systems. Discoveries and concrete advances made in this study will contribute to solutions for effective use of digital images-a problem that is central to research and application across science, technology, and medicine.

"Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment, toolbox development & evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Advances in digital imaging technologies have led to a substantial growth in the number of digital images being created and stored in hospitals, medical systems, and on the Internet in recent years. Effective medical image retrieval systems can play an important role in teaching, research, diagnosis and treatment. Images were historically retrieved using text-based methods. The quality of annotations associated with images can reduce the effectiveness of text-based image retrieval. Despite recent advances, purely content- based image retrieval techniques lag significantly behind their textual counterparts in their ability to capture the semantic essence of the user's query. Preliminary research suggests that a more promising approach is to adaptively combine these complementary techniques to suit the user and their information needs. However, for these approaches to succeed, the researcher needs to enhance her computational skills in addition to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the relevant clinical domain. This Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) grant application describes a training and career development plan that will allow the candidate, an NLM postdoctoral fellow in Medical Informatics at Oregon Health & Science University to achieve these objectives. The training component will be carried out under the mentorship of Dr. W. Hersh with Dr. Gorman (user studies). Dr. Fuss (radiation medicine) and Dr. Erdogmus (machine learning) providing additional mentoring in their areas of expertise.       The long-term goal of this Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) project is to improve visual information retrieval by better understanding user needs and proposing adaptive methodologies for multimodal image retrieval that will close the semantic gap. During the award period, activities will be focused on the following specific aims: (1) Understand the image retrieval needs of novice and expert users in radiation oncology and develop gold standards for evaluation; (2) Develop algorithms for semantic, multimodal image retrieval; (3) Perform user based evaluation of adaptive image retrieval in radiation oncology; (4) Extend the techniques developed to create a multimodal image retrieval system in pathology          n/a","Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment, toolbox development & evaluation",7739714,K99LM009889,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Award', 'Back', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Distance Learning', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image retrieval system', 'Imaging technology', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric System', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Oregon', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer site', 'care delivery', 'career development', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'improved', 'meetings', 'oncology', 'open source', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'visual information']",NLM,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K99,2009,104963,0.049326318929795096
"Robust BCT for Clinical Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a major public health threat for over 50% of the population over age 50. Despite its importance, osteoporosis is largely under-treated, with less than 20% of those recommended for testing being screened. With substantial reimbursement cuts being introduced by Medicare for bone densitometry by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, the current clinical standard), with a sensitivity of DXA for fracture prediction of less than 50%, and with the rapidly increasing size of the aging population of the U.S., there is an urgent need for additional and more sensitive modalities than DXA for clinical assessment of fracture risk. Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) has emerged as a powerful alternative to DXA. This CT-based technology creates a structural ""finite element"" model of a patient's bone from their CT scans, and subjects that model to virtual forces in order to provide an estimate of the strength of the bone. Well validated in cadaver studies and being a better predictor of bone strength than is bone mineral density by DXA, BCT has also been shown to be highly predictive of osteoporotic fractures in clinical research studies. However, robustness remains an issue - can the technique be used easily by non-experts in research and clinical environments? Addressing this issue, the overall goal of this research is to improve the robustness of our software, such that it can automatically analyze scans from a wide range of CT scanners and using a wide variety of CT acquisition protocols, including new low-dose protocols that limit radiation exposure to the patient. Such a robust BCT diagnostic tool could then be offered as a supplementary ""add-on"" analysis to many types of CT exams taken for other purposes such as CT colonography, pelvic, abdominal, and spine exams, thus reducing hospital costs, incurring no addition radiation to the patient, requiring no change in the CT acquisition protocols, and therefore greatly increasing the number of patients that could be screened at low cost. Specifically, we propose in this Phase-I project to combine expertise in computer vision, CT scanning, and biomechanics in order to develop an automated method of ""phantomless"" cross-calibration of CT scans for robust vertebral strength assessment. Focusing on the spine, our major tasks are to perform a series of clinical studies in which patients are scanned twice using a variety of CT acquisition protocols; develop a custom external-calibration phantom and use that to determine the effects of various CT acquisition parameters on scanning standardization; and use machine learning techniques to develop a ""statistical atlas"" of the spine for automation of all image processing. We will combine these efforts to develop a phantomless BCT method that accounts for differences in image quality due to variations in CT scanners and acquisition protocols, including low-dose protocols, and that does so in a highly automated fashion requiring minimal user expertise and input. Should this project be successful, future work will further refine the techniques, extend them to the hip and quantitative analysis of muscle and other soft tissues, and address robustness of longitudinal changes for clinical monitoring.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With a mortality rate up to 30% one year after hip fracture, and an economic burden exceeding $17 billion annually, osteoporotic fracture is a debilitating condition whose impact on our aging society is growing. Early identification of those at risk for fracture can guide prevention and treatment, and BCT will provide a means for such detection with a sensitivity and specificity lacking in DXA based bone densitometry. The greater radiation exposure from CT, however, limits the market for such a diagnostic. The proposed project will result in a robust diagnostic test that significantly lowers radiation dose to the patient, and in some implementations, completely eliminates additional radiation by using CT scans already ordered for other medical purposes. Successful development of this product will broaden the pool of individuals who will benefit from a more accurate and sensitive fracture risk prediction, expand the market for O. N. Diagnostics' business, and result in an important advance in the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.           Statement of Relevance With a mortality rate up to 30% one year after hip fracture, and an economic burden exceeding $17 billion annually, osteoporotic fracture is a debilitating condition whose impact on our aging society is growing.

"A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A decade ago when microarray was first invented, it was hailed as ""an array of hope"" in Nature Genetics and has received a considerable amount of attention in biomedicine. Subsequently it has been called ""an array of problems"" in Nature Review. An inherent problem with microarray gene expression is that structural information is missing, which limits its ability in biological discovery. To overcome the poor reproducibility and accuracy of microarray imaging, there needs to be a shift in fundamental paradigms to those able to incorporate complementary and multiscale structural imaging information into microarray imaging. Fortunately, the latest progress in high resolution biomolecular imaging probe development coupled with advanced image analysis makes integrative and systematic studies of cellular systems possible. A cell can be labeled using multiscale and multimodality imaging, providing both structural and functional information. With multiscale imaging spreadsheets now available, there is an overwhelming need within the life sciences community to manage this information effectively, to analyze it comprehensively, and to apply the resulting knowledge in the understanding of the genetic system of a cell. However, the management and mining of this large-scale imaging information is limited by today's computational approaches and knowledge-sharing infrastructure. These problems represent a major impediment to progress in the emerging area of bio-molecular image informatics. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a unique genomic image management and mining system that can allow geneticists to search, correlate and integrate this multiscale and multi-modality imaging information in an easily operable fashion and further enable new biological discovery. In particular, this system will fill a void left in the current image database systems such as Open Microscope Environment (OME), e.g., the lack of analytic tools for integrative data analysis. To realize this goal, we are bringing together a strong interdisciplinary team consisting of imaging engineers, geneticists and industrial imaging scientists. Building on our diverse and complementary expertise, we are able to provide innovative and interdisciplinary approaches that combine the latest progress in image processing, imaging database design and machine learning with the development of high resolution and high throughput molecular imaging probes in genomics. More specifically, we will accomplish the following specific aims. First, we will develop a suite of algorithms for content extraction and information retrieval from high resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) images. This visual system will effectively manage imaging phenotype information, facilitating knowledge discovery such as identifying visually similar subtypes. Second, we will correlate quantitative traits extracted from FISH imaging with genomic structural rearrangements and gene expression patterns. Finally, we will develop a data integration approach to fuse disparate information from multi-modality imaging databases for improved characterization of biological systems.               Public Health Relevance Statement The anticipated outcome of the project will include a publicly accessible imaging database analysis system to facilitate multiscale genomic image information integration and knowledge mining. The proposed approach challenges the current paradigm by the integration of high resolution structural imaging with functional information, which promises to overcome the poor accuracy and reproducibility problems plagued with microarray imaging.

"Accurate detection of chromosomal abnormalities with multi-color image processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The combination of high resolution assays in genomics with microscopic imaging has been used for the detection of complex chromosomal rearrangements, a significant but difficult problem in prenatal and postnatal diagnosis, birth defect detection and cancer research. As a recently developed molecular cytogenetic technique, multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) imaging has provided rapid and high resolution detection of chromosomal abnormalities associated with cancer and genetic disorders. However, the technique is currently limited to research use and only serves as an adjunct tool to the G-banding based monochromatic chromosomal karyotyping in a clinical laboratory. A primary barrier of the technique is the lower classification accuracy when classifying chromosomes from multi-color microscopic imaging data. Therefore, the goal of this R15 project is to develop innovative multi-spectral image processing and machine learning techniques for M-FISH image analysis so that chromosomal rearrangement detection can be made more reproducible, robust, and faster, thereby significantly increasing the ability and efficacy of this newly developed cellular imaging technique. Our proposed approaches such as multiscale feature extraction, nonlinear manifold analysis and adaptive fuzzy clustering are able to target specific features of multi-spectral imaging data, promising a significant improvement over the current techniques. In order to validate the technique and bring it into clinical use, we will partner with a clinical geneticist, Dr. Merlin Butler, and a cytogeneticist, Dr. Diane Persons both at Kansas University Medical Center. In addition, we will collaborate with an industrial scientist, Dr. Kenneth Castleman, who is the pioneer in developing and commercializing cytogenetic imaging products. Through our interdisciplinary research and collaboration, we will accomplish the following specific aims: 1) develop image normalization approaches to improve the acquisition of multi-color FISH images; 2) develop multiscale dimension analysis to extract features from multi-color images; 3) design adaptive fuzzy clustering and incorporate contextual information to improve the pixel-wise classification of chromosomes; and 4) validate computational approaches with clinical testing in collaboration with medical and industrial partners. This research project will also enhance our research infrastructure in biomedical image informatics and provide undergraduate and graduate students opportunities to touch the frontier of molecular and cellular imaging by participating in the proposed research activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unraveling complex rearrangements using cytogenetic approaches such as M-FISH imaging has been extremely useful in prenatal, postnatal and cancer diagnoses. Our proposed approaches have the potential to significantly improve the reliability of the newly developed M-FISH imaging technique, making it feasible for clinical use. This will in turn benefit the health of human beings.

"Cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in biopsies via spectral imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This is a Fast-Track application to provide reliable, cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in cancer biopsies to assist pharmaceutical drug development and provision of patient-specific prognosis and therapy guidance (""personalized medicine""). The organizing theme is that the appropriate unit of analysis should be the individual cell as opposed to averaged tumor extracts. To this end, novel technologies will be coupled with careful methods-development. Spectral imaging and advanced image analysis tools will permit multi-target immunohistochemical (IHC) and/or immunofluorescence (IF) detection, at the cellular and subcellular level in intact tissue sections. CRi-developed image processing and machine-learning tools provide automation and sophisticated quantitation options. Multiplexed staining protocols will yield independent, potentially stoichiometric labeling with combined IHC and IF. The sensitivity of all potential markers to variations in tissue handling will be carefully assessed; some may be robust and suitable for archival tissue studies, others will be too labile. Ultrasound-assisted fixation will be tested for its ability to preserve such labile epitopes for use in prospectively acquired tissues. Four or more pathway-related proteins will be detected in tissue sections, on a cell-by-cell basis, even if co-localized and with spectrally overlapping labels. The coordinated subcellular location of the pathway molecules will be also tracked, with simultaneous assessment of cell-surface receptors (e.g., EGFR, VEGF, Her2-neu), downstream signaling proteins and phosphoproteins (e.g., pAKT, pERK), nuclear proteins (e.g., ER, Ki67), and novel players such as protein-folding mediators (e.g. BIP1).       The project will combine optimized tissue protocols, multiplexed IHC/IF reagent kits, and unique machine- learning image analysis that can be used to automate region-detection and label-quantitation. All these depend on CRi's multispectral imaging approaches for assessing multiple analytes on a cell-by-cell and cell- compartment basis in tissue sections. Our collaborators will provide small-animal tumor models for early methods development, multiplexed immunohistochemical labeling of pathway proteins in clinical cancer biopsies, access to archived and prospectively acquired tissues from pathway-targeting clinical drug trials, highly informative archival tissue microarrays, access to validated, activation-specific antibodies, ultra-fast tissue fixation, and biostatistics support. The ""deliverable"" will be a suite of products suitable for clinical use that can provide much-needed valid information on single-cell-based pathway status in an intact tissue context to support pharmaceutical drug development efforts and provide molecularly focused patient care.       Significance and lay narrative: The ability to quantitatively evaluate multiple molecular targets and pathways on a cell-by-cell basis, in a single preparation of clinical tissue, is missing from the current toolbox of personalized medicine, which lacks good means of matching novel drugs and drug candidates to specific patients. Conventional molecular pathology methods are typically limited to a single immunohistochemical (IHC) test on a given tissue section or to expensive and time-consuming proteomics or expression-array approaches (which cannot directly report out pathway activation status in cancer cell populations and subpopulations). Multiplexed IHC (including immuno-fluorescence) combined with optimized sample handling protocols to retain pathway proteins and advanced image analysis will enable the unambiguous detection of active signaling pathways, benefiting pharmaceutical research in the selection of patients for better targeted trials and in the monitoring of response, and clinical practice for diagnosis, therapy selection, and monitoring response (i.e., theranostics).          Significance and lay narrative: The ability to quantitatively evaluate multiple  molecular targets and pathways on a cell-by-cell basis, in a single preparation of  clinical tissue, is missing from the current toolbox of personalized medicine,  which lacks good means of matching novel drugs and drug candidates to specific  patients.

"New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging has become a standard component of modern cardiology. In SPECT research (as in medical imaging generally), it has become widely accepted that advances in imaging hardware and algorithms should be guided by so-called task-based evaluation criteria, i.e., measures that reflect how the imaging technique will impact clinical decision making. In general, a human observer study is the gold standard for measuring task-based criteria; however, the expense and complexity of such studies precludes their routine use. Therefore, numerical observers-algorithms that emulate human observer performance-are now widely used as surrogates for human observers. In SPECT, one particular numerical observer, known as the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), has come to dominate the field. The CHO is a detection algorithm that is used to approximate the human observer's performance in detecting lesions; in the case of cardiac SPECT, the lesions of interest are perfusion defects. An imaging system or algorithm can be judged by the ability of the CHO to accurately detect defects based on the images produced. SPECT researchers now rely heavily (and sometimes exclusively) on numerical observers such as the CHO, not only to validate their final results, but also as a figure of merit that guides optimization of hardware or algorithms. Because of the central role it has come to play, the CHO and its extensions have become a major research topic in their own right. In the proposed project, our goal will be to create a suite of numerical observers that will shed light on a much wider set of clinical tasks than the CHO, and we will pursue an approach that we hypothesize will be more accurate than the CHO. Therefore, the proposed research is significant because it will yield an evaluation methodology that could potentially be used very widely by the research community, underpinning the development of imaging hardware and software. We will develop a software package for image quality assessment using the proposed NO approach and distribute it freely to the research community. As a by-product of the research, the proposed project will also yield a thorough task-based evaluation of major image reconstruction algorithms, and will answer the question of which sorts of data (on the spectrum from simple phantoms to clinical data) are a sufficient foundation for numerical observers to perform as desired. The research will also yield the basis for a potential computer aided diagnostic system for cardiology.

"Validation and Evaluation of a Portable Body Scanner for Determination of Obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Obesity has reached epidemic levels in the U.S., with 66% of adults overweight and 32% of adults obese. The research uses the new technique of three-dimensional  (3 D) photonic scanning to create and validate an instrument that  rapidly  assesses  obesity  in  clinical  and  field  settings.  The  first  aim  is  to develop a portable computer vision system of body imaging for 3 D surface imaging of the human body. The hardware system is designed from off-the- shelf components such as digital cameras, projectors, and personal computer. Algorithms for the 3D data are being developed and refined for calculation and system calibration for a small instrument. The second aim is to develop algorithms for surface reconstruction from 3D data in order to define a proper surface representation and to reconstruct a 3D model of the human body from incomplete and noisy data. The third aim begins the human measurement testing in 120 adults. Aim 3 is to estimate the size and shape of the reconstructed human body by a portable body imager and compare to current methods that assess obesity. Anthropometric parameters will be computed by a 3 second body scan via imaging and then compared to other methods of obesity assessment including BMI, waist circumference, sagittal abdominal diameter, bioimpedence, hydrodensitometry, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and air displacement plethysmography. The final aim is to validate body imaging as an indicator of central obesity (fat in the abdominal region, as opposed to subcutaneous depots) in a subset of 60 subjects because it is the abdominal fat that is most associated with health risks such as diabetes. Abdominal fat tissue as detected by magnetic resonance imaging scans will be compared to that calculated from 3 D body imaging.

"National Alliance-Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC)(RMI) The National Alliance for Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC) is a multiinstitutional, interdisciplinary team of  computer scientists, software engineers, and medical investigators who develop computational tools for the  analysis and visualization of medical image data. The purpose of the center is to provide the infrastructure  and environment for the development of computational algorithms and open source technologies, and then  oversee the training and dissemination of these tools to the medical research community. This world-class  software and development environment serves as a foundation for accelerating the development and  deployment of computational tools that are readily accessible to the medical research community. The team  combines cutting-edge computer vision research (to create medical imaging analysis algorithms) with state  of the art software engineering techniques (based on ""extreme"" programming techniques in a distributed,  open-source environment) to enable computational examination of both basic neurosience and neurologicat  disorders. In developing this infrastructure resource, the team will significantly expand upon proven open  systems technology and platforms. The driving biological projects will come initially from the study of  schizophrenia, but the methods will be applicable to many other diseases. The computational tools and open  systems technologies and platforms developed by NAMIC will initially be used to study anatomical structures  and connectivity patterns in the brain, derangements of which have long been thought to play a role in the  etiology of schizophrenia. The overall analysis will occur at a range of scales, and will occur across a range  of modalities including diffusion MRI, quantitative EGG, and metabolic and receptor PET, but potentially  including microscopic, genomic, and other image data. It will apply to image data from individual  )atients,and to studies executed across large poplulations. The data will be taken from subjects across a  Nide range of time scales and ultimately apply to a broad range of diseases in a broad range of organs. n/a",National Alliance-Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC)(RMI),7915998,U54EB005149,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Brain', 'Budgets', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Engineering', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'disability', 'egg', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'neuroimaging', 'open source', 'programs', 'receptor', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'tool', 'vector', 'vision development', 'water diffusion']",NIBIB,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U54,2009,3720664,0.028003621517072724
"A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis SUMMARY The requirement for a trained user to interact with tissue and images is a long-standing impediment to higher throughput analysis of biological microstructures using unbiased stereology, the state-of-the-art method for accurate quantification of biological structure. Phase 1 studies addressed this limitation with Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis (VCS), an innovative approach for automatic stereological analysis that improves throughput efficiency by 6-9 fold compared to conventional computerized stereology. Work in Phase 2 integrated VCS into the Stereologer"", an integrated hardware-software-microscopy system for stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images. Validation studies of first-order stereological parameters. i.e., volume, surface area, length, number, confirmed that the color-based detection methods in the VCS approach achieve accurate results for automatic stereological analysis of high S:N biological microstructures. These studies indicate that fully automatic stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images can be realized by elimination of two remaining barriers, which will be addressed in this Phase II Continuation Competing Renewal. In Aim 1, applications for feature extraction and microstructure classification, developed in part with funding from the Office of Naval Research, will be integrated into the VCS program. The new application (VCS II) will use these approaches to automatically detect and classify polymorphic microstructures of biological interest using a range of feature calculations, including size, color, border, shape, and texture, with support from active learning and Support Vector Machines. Work in Aim 2 will eliminate physical handling of glass slides during computerized stereology studies by equipping the Stereologer system with automatic slide loading/unloading technology controlled by the Stereologer system. This technology will approximately double the throughput efficiency of the current VCS program and support ""human-in-the-loop"" interaction for sample microstructures on the border between two or more adjacent classes. The studies in Aim 3 will rigorously test the hypothesis that fully automatic VCS can quantify first- and second-order stereological parameters, without a loss of accuracy compared to the current gold-standard - non-automatic computerized stereology, e.g., manual Stereologer. If these studies validate the accuracy of VCS II, then commercialization of the fully automatic program will facilitate the throughout efficiency for testing scientific hypotheses in a wide variety of biomedical research projects; reduce labor costs for computerized stereology studies; hasten the growth of our understanding of biological processes that underlie health, longevity, and disease; and accelerate the development of novel approaches for the therapeutic management of human disease. Solid evidence that the SRC and its strategic partners can effectively commercialize this technology is demonstrated by their worldwide sales and support of the Stereologer system for the past 13 years.

"Detection of Drug Effects in Small Groups Using PET    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to develop optimized image analysis pipelines for pharmaceutical evaluation based on functional neuroimaging, in particular based on positron emission tomography (PET). Strength of drug effect will be assessed using statistical measures of detection power, reproducibility of spatial activation patterns, and regional power estimates. Spatial parametric images will be computed for each of the prediction models investigated. A wide range of predictive models, including many that are new to the functional neuroimaging field, will be implemented and evaluated within a sophisticated statistical resampling framework. A grid-aware software package will be developed based on the results obtained. This software is intended to be run in-house in a distributed computing environment at Predictek to provide state-of-the-art optimized image analysis services to its customers. A scaled-down user-friendly Java implementation of some of the best- performing methods (based on evaluations performed in the project) will also be developed for distribution to end users wishing to perform advanced analyses themselves.

"Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging tool but many important clinical applications are limited by long scan times and/or poor SNR. This proposal aims to improve the speed of MRI without losing SNR, through a Bayesian inference approach. Improvement in scan speed can enable new time-critical clinical and diagnostic MR applications, like cardiac imaging, time-resolved 4D coronary angiography, high-resolution volumetric brain imaging, dynamic contrast enhanced imaging, etc. A Bayesian framework for the reconstruction of raw MR data from multiple coils in parallel will be developed. This framework makes it possible to reduce the time taken during scanning multiple times by reducing the sampling rate of raw MR data. Our method will be generally applicable to most MR imaging modalities, targets and sampling schemes. Our method will then be validated and tested on the specific clinical application of volumetric structural brain imaging, which is an important procedure for the detection and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, tumors, white matter lesions, measuring brain atrophy and hippocampal subfields, etc. The main goal of this project is to create a set of computational tools to perform the reconstruction of accelerated MRI data on arbitrary imaging targets, modalities and acquisition schemes, including random sampling schemes. Design of models to capture prior spatial information about images will be undertaken. Finally, the method will be validated on structural brain data in terms of metrics like SNR, partial voluming, test- retest repeatability, and the performance of subsequent processing steps like image segmentation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project has the potential to make clinical MR imaging much faster than currently possible. This will make many time-critical clinical applications of MRI more feasible, for instance real-time MRI of the heart. The resolving power of MRI to image finer, clinically interesting anatomical features will also increase, making more reliable diagnosis possible.          n/a",Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S,7688029,R21EB008138,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical application', 'combinatorial', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'expectation', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'model design', 'nervous system disorder', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'tumor', 'white matter']",NIBIB,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2009,211250,0.006853908932359009
"Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Conventional ROC analysis has been widely accepted as a standard in the assessment of diagnostic techniques for binary diagnoses. Many medical diagnoses, however, involve multiple diagnostic alternatives. Examples are breast cancer diagnosis using mammography, where the diagnostic classes are normal, benign, or malignant tumor, and cardiac disease diagnosis using myocardial perfusion SPECT (MRS), where the classes are normal, reversible or fixed defect. To assess multi-class diagnostic techniques, multi-class ROC is required, but has remained an unsolved problem ever since the introduction of binary ROC analysis in the 1950s. Sparked by a practical challenge raised by MPS optimization, the candidate proposed a three- class ROC analysis method that extends and unifies the decision theoretic, linear discriminant analysis and probabilistic foundations of binary ROC in a three-class paradigm. She has conducted five preliminary studies on three-class ROC analysis: (1) deriving its decision model [He, Metz, et.al IEEE Trans Med Imag (TMI) vol. 25(5), 2006]; (2) investigating its decision theoretic foundation [He and Frey, TMI, vol. 25(8), 2006]; (3) exploring its linear discriminant analysis (LDA) foundation [He and Frey, TMI, in press, 2006]; (4) establishing its probabilistic foundation; and (5) comparing it with conventional three-class LDA and revealing the limitations of conventional three-class LDA. The candidate obtained a PhD in Biomedical Engineering in December 2005 and had intensive training on medical imaging. She increased her interest in medical image quality assessment during the development of three-class ROC analysis; her knowledge of the statistics and decision theory principals used in this research is self-taught. Further exploring new areas opened by three- class ROC analysis requires systematic understanding of the statistical principles in decision theory, statistical learning, and Bayesian modeling, etc. Thus, she requests a two-year mentored phase focusing on formal biostatistics training. The training phase will substantially enhance the candidate's career development as an interdisciplinary investigator and contribute to her independent research to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) to establish the theoretical foundations of three-class ROC analysis; (2) to develop general statistical methods for three-class ROC analysis; (3) to apply the three-class methodologies to task-based medical image quality assessment. The significance of the proposed work is two-fold. First, it provides a rigorous solution to an open theoretical problem and will open new areas of theoretical research in ROC analysis and medical decision making. Second, it enables applications of task-based assessment techniques for multi-class diagnosis. These techniques have the potential to fundamentally improve current imaging techniques for disease detection and characterization, and thus to enhance doctors' performance in disease diagnosis, which will broadly benefit public health.          n/a",Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment,7480255,K99EB007620,"['Area', 'Benign', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical assessment', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'career', 'improved', 'interest', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'statistics']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K99,2008,89733,-0.0006819240782188305
"Toward Quantitative Disease Assessment from Capsule Endoscopy Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Capsule endoscopy has recently emerged as a valuable imaging technology for the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, especially the small bowel and the esophagus. With this technology, it has become possible to directly evaluate the gut mucosa of patients with a variety of conditions, such as obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, celiac disease and Crohn's disease. Although the use of capsule endoscopy is gaining rapidly, the evaluation of capsule endoscopic imagery presents numerous practical challenges. In a typical case, the capsule acquires 50,000 or more images over an eight-hour period. The quality of these images is highly variable due to the uncontrolled motion of the capsule itself as it moves through the GI tract, the complexity of the structures being imaged, and inherent limitations of the imager itself. In practice, relatively few (often less than 100) of these images contain significant diagnostic content. As a result, it is challenging to create an effective, repeatable means for evaluating capsule endoscopic sequences. The goal of this project is create a tool for semi-automated, objective, quantitative assessment of pathologic findings in capsule endoscopic data. The clinical focus will be on quantitative assessment of lesions that appear in Crohn's disease of the small bowel. The technical approach to this problem will make use of statistical learning methods to create algorithms that perform lesion classification and assessment in a manner consistent with a trained expert. The underlying hypothesis of this project is that appropriately constructed algorithms will be able to perform assessment of lesions appearing in capsule endoscopic images with a level of consistency comparable to human observers. In proving this hypothesis, the proposed project will pursue the following three specific aims:       Aim 1: Data acquisition. To develop a substantial database of images of intestinal lesions together with an expert assessment of several attributes indicative of lesion severity.       Aim 2: Tissue classification and image enhancement. To develop algorithms for low-level classification of tissue type from image content using statistical learning techniques, and to create algorithms for registering multiple partial views of a lesion to create more complete views.       Aim 3: Automated Lesion Assessment. To apply and validate statistical learning methods that can assess the images produced by Aim 2 in a manner consistent with the expert assessments compiled in Aim 1.       The focus of this R21 is on the development of tools that have proven efficacy on a representative corpus of data. This will set the stage for subsequent technological developments leading toward the automated detection of lesions, and subsequent clinical studies addressing the development of quantitative measures for Crohn's disease severity in a more substantial clinical setting.          n/a",Toward Quantitative Disease Assessment from Capsule Endoscopy Images,7496032,R21EB008227,"['Address', 'Aggressive Clinical Course', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Body of uterus', 'Celiac Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Condition', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Eating', 'End Point', 'Endoscopy', 'Esophagus', 'Evaluation', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Healed', 'Hemorrhage', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Intestines', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Intestines', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ulcer', 'base', 'capsule', 'data acquisition', 'gastrointestinal', 'healing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'size', 'small bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,189850,0.015153388651631646
"New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging has become a standard component of modern cardiology. In SPECT research (as in medical imaging generally), it has become widely accepted that advances in imaging hardware and algorithms should be guided by so-called task-based evaluation criteria, i.e., measures that reflect how the imaging technique will impact clinical decision making. In general, a human observer study is the gold standard for measuring task-based criteria; however, the expense and complexity of such studies precludes their routine use. Therefore, numerical observers-algorithms that emulate human observer performance-are now widely used as surrogates for human observers. In SPECT, one particular numerical observer, known as the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), has come to dominate the field. The CHO is a detection algorithm that is used to approximate the human observer's performance in detecting lesions; in the case of cardiac SPECT, the lesions of interest are perfusion defects. An imaging system or algorithm can be judged by the ability of the CHO to accurately detect defects based on the images produced. SPECT researchers now rely heavily (and sometimes exclusively) on numerical observers such as the CHO, not only to validate their final results, but also as a figure of merit that guides optimization of hardware or algorithms. Because of the central role it has come to play, the CHO and its extensions have become a major research topic in their own right. In the proposed project, our goal will be to create a suite of numerical observers that will shed light on a much wider set of clinical tasks than the CHO, and we will pursue an approach that we hypothesize will be more accurate than the CHO. Therefore, the proposed research is significant because it will yield an evaluation methodology that could potentially be used very widely by the research community, underpinning the development of imaging hardware and software. We will develop a software package for image quality assessment using the proposed NO approach and distribute it freely to the research community. As a by-product of the research, the proposed project will also yield a thorough task-based evaluation of major image reconstruction algorithms, and will answer the question of which sorts of data (on the spectrum from simple phantoms to clinical data) are a sufficient foundation for numerical observers to perform as desired. The research will also yield the basis for a potential computer aided diagnostic system for cardiology. The specific aims of the research will be as follows: 1) Create a comprehensive set of imaging data and human observer scores; 2) Develop a suite of numerical observers based on our novel learning-based approach, as well as more-conventional statistical decision theory principles; 3) Compare and evaluate the numerical observers; and 4) Develop and disseminate by-products of the research program.          n/a",New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology,7355521,R01HL091017,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Play', 'Pliability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Score', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Viability', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'base', 'computer program', 'desire', 'experience', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2008,431744,0.008330658958951674
"Validation and Evaluation of a Portable Body Scanner for Determination of Obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Obesity has reached epidemic levels in the U.S., with 66% of adults overweight and 32% of adults obese. The research uses the new technique of three-dimensional  (3 D) photonic scanning to create and validate an instrument that  rapidly  assesses  obesity  in  clinical  and  field  settings.  The  first  aim  is  to develop a portable computer vision system of body imaging for 3 D surface imaging of the human body. The hardware system is designed from off-the- shelf components such as digital cameras, projectors, and personal computer. Algorithms for the 3D data are being developed and refined for calculation and system calibration for a small instrument. The second aim is to develop algorithms for surface reconstruction from 3D data in order to define a proper surface representation and to reconstruct a 3D model of the human body from incomplete and noisy data. The third aim begins the human measurement testing in 120 adults. Aim 3 is to estimate the size and shape of the reconstructed human body by a portable body imager and compare to current methods that assess obesity. Anthropometric parameters will be computed by a 3 second body scan via imaging and then compared to other methods of obesity assessment including BMI, waist circumference, sagittal abdominal diameter, bioimpedence, hydrodensitometry, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and air displacement plethysmography. The final aim is to validate body imaging as an indicator of central obesity (fat in the abdominal region, as opposed to subcutaneous depots) in a subset of 60 subjects because it is the abdominal fat that is most associated with health risks such as diabetes. Abdominal fat tissue as detected by magnetic resonance imaging scans will be compared to that calculated from 3 D body imaging. In sum, the non-contact, noninvasive nature of this new portable body scanner will produce a quick, inexpensive and objective measure of body size and type of obesity.             n/a",Validation and Evaluation of a Portable Body Scanner for Determination of Obesity,7495057,R21DK081206,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Body Image', 'Body Size', 'Body fat', 'Body measure procedure', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Central obesity', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Height', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Personal Computers', 'Plethysmography', 'Population Study', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Skeletal system', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Sum', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Validation', 'abdominal fat', 'design', 'digital', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'photonics', 'reconstruction', 'size', 'subcutaneous', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'waist circumference']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2008,15000,0.010042439826646432

"In-vivo optical molecular imaging with Dynamic Contrast Enhancement (DyCE)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fluorescence-based molecular Imaging in small animals is having a major impact on drug development and disease research. However, a significant challenge to imaging targeted fluorescent markers in vivo remains: unless the labeled regions are located superficially; localization, quantitation and host organ identification are impeded by the effects of light scattering and absorption. Orthotopic tumor and disease models are increasingly preferred over less biologically relevant subcutaneous xenografts. In such studies, substantial difficulties are encountered in longitudinal studies where animals are growing and are positioned differently for each measurement. We believe that a single imaging advance could address many of these issues, and advance the utility of in-vivo molecular imaging: an exact anatomical co-registration technique that does not rely on multimodal techniques. This proposal describes dynamic molecular imaging (DMI), an approach that can provide co-registered anatomical information by exploiting in-vivo pharmacokinetics of dyes in small animals in a simple and inexpensive way. We demonstrate that by acquiring a time-series of optical images during injection of an inert dye, we can repeatably and accurately delineate the major internal organs of mice using optical imaging alone. This is possible because each major organ is ""illuminated"" by the kinetics of dye passing through it in such a manner as to make it distinguishable from other structures. Spatiotemporal analysis can exploit these characteristic time courses to allow the body-surface representation of each organ to be visualized. These in- vivo anatomical maps can be overlaid onto simultaneously acquired images of a targeted molecular probe (detected and distinguished from the mapping dye via multispectral imaging techniques, if necessary) to significantly aid in identification of the probe's anatomical and physical location. Using CRi's existing and prototype 2D, ""2.5D"" and true 3D multispectral mouse imaging systems, we propose to test and refine a DMI approach. Based on our findings to date, we will examine and exploit in-vivo pharmacokinetics of the near-infrared dye, indocyanine green, to generate delineated surface projections of individual organs. Co-registering this surface map with surface projections of detected targeted labels will allow the targeted probe's 3D spatial location to be inferred. This information can further be used to improve quantitative accuracy in longitudinal molecular imaging studies of deep targets.           n/a",In-vivo optical molecular imaging with Dynamic Contrast Enhancement (DyCE),7485551,R43EB008627,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Body Surface', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Depth', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Dyes', 'Fluorescence', 'General Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Indocyanine Green', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Animal Imaging Systems', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Visualization software', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'Xenograft procedure', 'absorption', 'base', 'blind', 'data acquisition', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'instrumentation', 'light scattering', 'longitudinal animal study', 'millimeter', 'molecular imaging', 'novel strategies', 'optical imaging', 'photonics', 'prototype', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'subcutaneous', 'tumor']",NIBIB,CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH AND INSTRUMENTATION,R43,2008,167462,0.0038185258102161174
"Detection of Drug Effects in Small Groups Using PET    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to develop optimized image analysis pipelines for pharmaceutical evaluation based on functional neuroimaging, in particular based on positron emission tomography (PET). Strength of drug effect will be assessed using statistical measures of detection power, reproducibility of spatial activation patterns, and regional power estimates. Spatial parametric images will be computed for each of the prediction models investigated. A wide range of predictive models, including many that are new to the functional neuroimaging field, will be implemented and evaluated within a sophisticated statistical resampling framework. A grid-aware software package will be developed based on the results obtained. This software is intended to be run in-house in a distributed computing environment at Predictek to provide state-of-the-art optimized image analysis services to its customers. A scaled-down user-friendly Java implementation of some of the best- performing methods (based on evaluations performed in the project) will also be developed for distribution to end users wishing to perform advanced analyses themselves.

"National Alliance-Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC)(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The National Alliance for Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC) is a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, software engineers, and medical investigators who develop computational tools for the analysis and visualization of medical image data. The purpose of the center is to provide the infrastructure and environment for the development of computational algorithms and open source technologies, and then oversee the training and dissemination of these tools to the medical research community. This world-class software and development environment serves as a foundation for accelerating the development and deployment of computational tools that are readily accessible to the medical research community. The team combines cutting-edge computer vision research (to create medical imaging analysis algorithms) with state-of-the-art software engineering techniques (based on ""extreme"" programming techniques in a distributed, open-source environment) to enable computational examination of both basic neuroscience and neurological disorders. In developing this infrastructure resource, the team will significantly expand upon proven open systems technology and platforms. The driving biological projects will come initially from the study of schizophrenia, but the methods will be applicable to many other diseases. The computational tools and open systems technologies and platforms developed by NAMIC will initially be used to study anatomical structures and connectivity patterns in the brain, derangements of which have long been thought to play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia. The overall analysis will occur at a range of scales, and will occur across a range of modalities including diffusion MRI, quantitative EGG, and metabolic and receptor PET, but potentially including microscopic, genomic, and other image data. It will apply to image data from individual patients, and to studies executed across large populations. The data will be taken from subjects across a wide range of time scales and ultimately apply to a broad range of diseases in a broad range of organs.             n/a",National Alliance-Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC)(RMI),7479786,U54EB005149,[' '],NIBIB,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U54,2008,3534631,0.02784312282865637
"Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in imaging have revolutionized the biomedical investigation of illness. The tremendous potential that this methodology brings to advancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and in treatment of illnesses has as yet remained largely an unfulfilled promise. This potential has been limited by a number of technological impediments that could be in large part overcome by the availability of a federated imaging database and the attendant infrastructure. Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates. These broad areas of work will come together in through key collaborations that will ensure utilization promotion by facilitating data entry into the federated database and creation of database incentive functionality. Our participating sites include MGH (PI), BWH, UCI, Duke, UCLA, UCSD, John Hopkins, and newly added Washington University and MIT. We have made a concerted effort to bridge the gap that can exist between biomedical and computational sciences by recruiting to our group leaders in both of these domains. Our efforts will be coordinated with those of the entire BIRN consortium in order to insure that acquisition and database functionality, and application-based disorder queries are interoperable across sites and designed to advance the capabilities to further knowledge and understanding of health and disease.         n/a",Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network,7467385,U24RR021382,[' '],NCRR,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U24,2008,5140823,0.019528325215782624
"Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging tool but many important clinical applications are limited by long scan times and/or poor SNR. This proposal aims to improve the speed of MRI without losing SNR, through a Bayesian inference approach. Improvement in scan speed can enable new time-critical clinical and diagnostic MR applications, like cardiac imaging, time-resolved 4D coronary angiography, high-resolution volumetric brain imaging, dynamic contrast enhanced imaging, etc. A Bayesian framework for the reconstruction of raw MR data from multiple coils in parallel will be developed. This framework makes it possible to reduce the time taken during scanning multiple times by reducing the sampling rate of raw MR data. Our method will be generally applicable to most MR imaging modalities, targets and sampling schemes. Our method will then be validated and tested on the specific clinical application of volumetric structural brain imaging, which is an important procedure for the detection and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, tumors, white matter lesions, measuring brain atrophy and hippocampal subfields, etc. The main goal of this project is to create a set of computational tools to perform the reconstruction of accelerated MRI data on arbitrary imaging targets, modalities and acquisition schemes, including random sampling schemes. Design of models to capture prior spatial information about images will be undertaken. Finally, the method will be validated on structural brain data in terms of metrics like SNR, partial voluming, test- retest repeatability, and the performance of subsequent processing steps like image segmentation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project has the potential to make clinical MR imaging much faster than currently possible. This will make many time-critical clinical applications of MRI more feasible, for instance real-time MRI of the heart. The resolving power of MRI to image finer, clinically interesting anatomical features will also increase, making more reliable diagnosis possible.          n/a",Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S,7528771,R21EB008138,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blur', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pulse taking', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical application', 'combinatorial', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'expectation', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'model design', 'nervous system disorder', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'tumor', 'white matter']",NIBIB,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2008,252375,0.006853908932359009
"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: This application responds to RFA: PAR-07-249, ""Collaborations with National Centers for Biomedical Computing"". The goal of this project is to develop and widely distribute a software package for robust measurement of brain structure in MR images by using computational neuroanatomy methods. The project will collaborate with the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) to develop the software using the NA-MIC Software Engineering Process, leverage the NA-MIC engineering infrastructure, and integrate this software into the 3D Slicer, a well-architected application environment being developed in NA-MIC. The particular software package will include both a brain image registration and warping algorithm, called HAMMER, and an algorithm for the segmentation of white matter lesions (WMLs), which can arise from a variety of pathologies including vascular pathology and multiple sclerosis. HAMMER received 2006 Best Paper Award from IEEE Signal Processing Society. HAMMER has been successfully applied to many large clinical research studies and clinical trials involving over 5,000 MR brain images and has been downloaded by 318 users from 102 institutions in over 20 countries. The WML segmentation algorithm has been successfully applied to ""Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes-Memory in Diabetes"" (ACCORD-MIND) sub- study, with data acquired from 4 centers on 650 patients over a period of 8 years. Designing an easy-to-use, robust software package for these two algorithms and incorporating it into the 3D Slicer will benefit a large community of end-users that need access to advanced image analysis methods in various neuroimaging studies. To increase the robustness of the algorithms to the highly variable quality and characteristics of clinical image data, further algorithm development is necessary. To increase ease of use by non-experts in computer analysis methods and integrate this software into the Slicer platform, significant software engineering efforts are planned. Three aims will be investigated. The first aim is to further develop and extend novel image analysis methods aiming at improving the robustness and performance of HAMMER registration and WML segmentation algorithms, so that they can be easily applied to various clinical research studies. The second and third aims are to design separate software modules for these two algorithms, and to incorporate them into the 3D Slicer. These two modules will be designed (1) with consistent cross-platform interactive and scripted interfaces, (2) allowing end-users to interactively explore the suitable parameters for their data, (3) enabling developers to add new functions. The robustness of these two modules will be extensively tested and improved by both software engineering tools and various clinical research data (acquired from different centers). The final software will be freely available in both source code and pre-compiled programs.

"Spectral imaging for automated malignant blast counting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We propose to extend our successful development of an agile spectral light source for light microscopy, funded through the NCI-IMAT initiative, into FDA trials. The SpectraLamp(tm) device enables the automated and quantitative analysis of double-immunostained samples in brightfield (non-fluorescence-based) microscopy, with particular utility for hematopathology applications. A clinically compelling area is the enumeration of malignant blasts in bone marrow biopsy specimens of patients with acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myleloproliferative diseases for the purpose of staging and evaluating therapeutic responses. Current methods are inadequate due to poor sampling (typical of bone marrow aspirates) or difficulty in identifying true blasts (bone marrow biopsies and single-color immunohistochemical phenotyping). Double-immunophenotyping permits largely unambiguous detection, but such labeling strategies are not supported by standard (non-multispectral) color imaging systems. To overcome this limitation, we will combine our multispectral imaging system with a high-speed slide-scanning platform that can scan an entire bone-marrow biopsy at high resolution in under 3 minutes. Machine-learning software tools and spectral imaging will identify blasts, combining morphology parameters and double or even triple immunophenotyping to ensure accuracy and precision. After blasts are identified, flow-cytometrylike software will present the data in histograms and other modalities, allowing the user to ""gate"" on particular cellular populations and pull up panels of cell images for confirmation.      Time-line: Final equipment-related tasks will be accomplished in the first year and preliminary testing of the instrumentation and software features will occur in the second year, as will development of qualified panels of immunoreagents and staining protocols (by DAKOCytomation).

"Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Conventional ROC analysis has been widely accepted as a standard in the assessment of diagnostic techniques for binary diagnoses. Many medical diagnoses, however, involve multiple diagnostic alternatives. Examples are breast cancer diagnosis using mammography, where the diagnostic classes are normal, benign, or malignant tumor, and cardiac disease diagnosis using myocardial perfusion SPECT (MRS), where the classes are normal, reversible or fixed defect. To assess multi-class diagnostic techniques, multi-class ROC is required, but has remained an unsolved problem ever since the introduction of binary ROC analysis in the 1950s. Sparked by a practical challenge raised by MPS optimization, the candidate proposed a three- class ROC analysis method that extends and unifies the decision theoretic, linear discriminant analysis and probabilistic foundations of binary ROC in a three-class paradigm. She has conducted five preliminary studies on three-class ROC analysis: (1) deriving its decision model [He, Metz, et.al IEEE Trans Med Imag (TMI) vol. 25(5), 2006]; (2) investigating its decision theoretic foundation [He and Frey, TMI, vol. 25(8), 2006]; (3) exploring its linear discriminant analysis (LDA) foundation [He and Frey, TMI, in press, 2006]; (4) establishing its probabilistic foundation; and (5) comparing it with conventional three-class LDA and revealing the limitations of conventional three-class LDA. The candidate obtained a PhD in Biomedical Engineering in December 2005 and had intensive training on medical imaging. She increased her interest in medical image quality assessment during the development of three-class ROC analysis; her knowledge of the statistics and decision theory principals used in this research is self-taught. Further exploring new areas opened by three- class ROC analysis requires systematic understanding of the statistical principles in decision theory, statistical learning, and Bayesian modeling, etc. Thus, she requests a two-year mentored phase focusing on formal biostatistics training. The training phase will substantially enhance the candidate's career development as an interdisciplinary investigator and contribute to her independent research to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) to establish the theoretical foundations of three-class ROC analysis; (2) to develop general statistical methods for three-class ROC analysis; (3) to apply the three-class methodologies to task-based medical image quality assessment. The significance of the proposed work is two-fold. First, it provides a rigorous solution to an open theoretical problem and will open new areas of theoretical research in ROC analysis and medical decision making. Second, it enables applications of task-based assessment techniques for multi-class diagnosis. These techniques have the potential to fundamentally improve current imaging techniques for disease detection and characterization, and thus to enhance doctors' performance in disease diagnosis, which will broadly benefit public health.          n/a",Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment,7298516,K99EB007620,"['Area', 'Benign', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical assessment', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'career', 'improved', 'interest', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'statistics']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K99,2007,88539,-0.0006819240782188305
"Cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in biopsies via spectral imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This is a Fast-Track application to provide reliable, cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in cancer biopsies to assist pharmaceutical drug development and provision of patient-specific prognosis and therapy guidance (""personalized medicine""). The organizing theme is that the appropriate unit of analysis should be the individual cell as opposed to averaged tumor extracts. To this end, novel technologies will be coupled with careful methods-development. Spectral imaging and advanced image analysis tools will permit multi-target immunohistochemical (IHC) and/or immunofluorescence (IF) detection, at the cellular and subcellular level in intact tissue sections. CRi-developed image processing and machine-learning tools provide automation and sophisticated quantitation options. Multiplexed staining protocols will yield independent, potentially stoichiometric labeling with combined IHC and IF. The sensitivity of all potential markers to variations in tissue handling will be carefully assessed; some may be robust and suitable for archival tissue studies, others will be too labile. Ultrasound-assisted fixation will be tested for its ability to preserve such labile epitopes for use in prospectively acquired tissues. Four or more pathway-related proteins will be detected in tissue sections, on a cell-by-cell basis, even if co-localized and with spectrally overlapping labels. The coordinated subcellular location of the pathway molecules will be also tracked, with simultaneous assessment of cell-surface receptors (e.g., EGFR, VEGF, Her2-neu), downstream signaling proteins and phosphoproteins (e.g., pAKT, pERK), nuclear proteins (e.g., ER, Ki67), and novel players such as protein-folding mediators (e.g. BIP1).       The project will combine optimized tissue protocols, multiplexed IHC/IF reagent kits, and unique machine- learning image analysis that can be used to automate region-detection and label-quantitation. All these depend on CRi's multispectral imaging approaches for assessing multiple analytes on a cell-by-cell and cell- compartment basis in tissue sections. Our collaborators will provide small-animal tumor models for early methods development, multiplexed immunohistochemical labeling of pathway proteins in clinical cancer biopsies, access to archived and prospectively acquired tissues from pathway-targeting clinical drug trials, highly informative archival tissue microarrays, access to validated, activation-specific antibodies, ultra-fast tissue fixation, and biostatistics support. The ""deliverable"" will be a suite of products suitable for clinical use that can provide much-needed valid information on single-cell-based pathway status in an intact tissue context to support pharmaceutical drug development efforts and provide molecularly focused patient care.       Significance and lay narrative: The ability to quantitatively evaluate multiple molecular targets and pathways on a cell-by-cell basis, in a single preparation of clinical tissue, is missing from the current toolbox of personalized medicine, which lacks good means of matching novel drugs and drug candidates to specific patients. Conventional molecular pathology methods are typically limited to a single immunohistochemical (IHC) test on a given tissue section or to expensive and time-consuming proteomics or expression-array approaches (which cannot directly report out pathway activation status in cancer cell populations and subpopulations). Multiplexed IHC (including immuno-fluorescence) combined with optimized sample handling protocols to retain pathway proteins and advanced image analysis will enable the unambiguous detection of active signaling pathways, benefiting pharmaceutical research in the selection of patients for better targeted trials and in the monitoring of response, and clinical practice for diagnosis, therapy selection, and monitoring response (i.e., theranostics).          n/a",Cellularly resolved molecular pathway assessment in biopsies via spectral imaging,7298872,R44CA130026,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Avastin', 'BAY 54-9085', 'BIK gene', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'British Columbia', 'CD34 gene', 'Calibration', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Certification', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Correlative Study', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'Employment', 'Energy Transfer', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Fixatives', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Localized', 'Location', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nuclear Antigens', 'Nuclear Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Focused Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Reagent', 'Receptor Activation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Roche brand of trastuzumab', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Score', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Thick', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Tissue Fixation', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transillumination', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Weight', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'commercialization', 'day', 'design', 'drug development', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'lapatinib', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'member', 'method development', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'molecular pathology', 'mouse model', 'nanoparticle', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prospective', 'protein expression', 'protein folding', 'research study', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'statistics', 'subcutaneous', 'tissue culture', 'tissue processing', 'tissue/cell culture', 'tool', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH AND INSTRUMENTATION,R44,2007,227868,-0.026299743502101375
"Toward Quantitative Disease Assessment from Capsule Endoscopy Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Capsule endoscopy has recently emerged as a valuable imaging technology for the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, especially the small bowel and the esophagus. With this technology, it has become possible to directly evaluate the gut mucosa of patients with a variety of conditions, such as obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, celiac disease and Crohn's disease. Although the use of capsule endoscopy is gaining rapidly, the evaluation of capsule endoscopic imagery presents numerous practical challenges. In a typical case, the capsule acquires 50,000 or more images over an eight-hour period. The quality of these images is highly variable due to the uncontrolled motion of the capsule itself as it moves through the GI tract, the complexity of the structures being imaged, and inherent limitations of the imager itself. In practice, relatively few (often less than 100) of these images contain significant diagnostic content. As a result, it is challenging to create an effective, repeatable means for evaluating capsule endoscopic sequences. The goal of this project is create a tool for semi-automated, objective, quantitative assessment of pathologic findings in capsule endoscopic data. The clinical focus will be on quantitative assessment of lesions that appear in Crohn's disease of the small bowel. The technical approach to this problem will make use of statistical learning methods to create algorithms that perform lesion classification and assessment in a manner consistent with a trained expert. The underlying hypothesis of this project is that appropriately constructed algorithms will be able to perform assessment of lesions appearing in capsule endoscopic images with a level of consistency comparable to human observers. In proving this hypothesis, the proposed project will pursue the following three specific aims:       Aim 1: Data acquisition. To develop a substantial database of images of intestinal lesions together with an expert assessment of several attributes indicative of lesion severity.       Aim 2: Tissue classification and image enhancement. To develop algorithms for low-level classification of tissue type from image content using statistical learning techniques, and to create algorithms for registering multiple partial views of a lesion to create more complete views.       Aim 3: Automated Lesion Assessment. To apply and validate statistical learning methods that can assess the images produced by Aim 2 in a manner consistent with the expert assessments compiled in Aim 1.       The focus of this R21 is on the development of tools that have proven efficacy on a representative corpus of data. This will set the stage for subsequent technological developments leading toward the automated detection of lesions, and subsequent clinical studies addressing the development of quantitative measures for Crohn's disease severity in a more substantial clinical setting.          n/a",Toward Quantitative Disease Assessment from Capsule Endoscopy Images,7362843,R21EB008227,"['Address', 'Aggressive Clinical Course', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Body of uterus', 'Celiac Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Condition', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Eating', 'End Point', 'Endoscopy', 'Esophagus', 'Evaluation', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Healed', 'Hemorrhage', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Intestines', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Intestines', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ulcer', 'base', 'capsule', 'data acquisition', 'gastrointestinal', 'healing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'size', 'small bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2007,235138,0.015153388651631646
"Validation and Evaluation of a Portable Body Scanner for Determination of Obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Obesity has reached epidemic levels in the U.S., with 66% of adults overweight and 32% of adults obese. The research uses the new technique of three-dimensional  (3 D) photonic scanning to create and validate an instrument that  rapidly  assesses  obesity  in  clinical  and  field  settings.  The  first  aim  is  to develop a portable computer vision system of body imaging for 3 D surface imaging of the human body. The hardware system is designed from off-the- shelf components such as digital cameras, projectors, and personal computer. Algorithms for the 3D data are being developed and refined for calculation and system calibration for a small instrument. The second aim is to develop algorithms for surface reconstruction from 3D data in order to define a proper surface representation and to reconstruct a 3D model of the human body from incomplete and noisy data. The third aim begins the human measurement testing in 120 adults. Aim 3 is to estimate the size and shape of the reconstructed human body by a portable body imager and compare to current methods that assess obesity. Anthropometric parameters will be computed by a 3 second body scan via imaging and then compared to other methods of obesity assessment including BMI, waist circumference, sagittal abdominal diameter, bioimpedence, hydrodensitometry, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and air displacement plethysmography. The final aim is to validate body imaging as an indicator of central obesity (fat in the abdominal region, as opposed to subcutaneous depots) in a subset of 60 subjects because it is the abdominal fat that is most associated with health risks such as diabetes. Abdominal fat tissue as detected by magnetic resonance imaging scans will be compared to that calculated from 3 D body imaging. In sum, the non-contact, noninvasive nature of this new portable body scanner will produce a quick, inexpensive and objective measure of body size and type of obesity.             n/a",Validation and Evaluation of a Portable Body Scanner for Determination of Obesity,7337256,R21DK081206,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Body Image', 'Body Size', 'Body fat', 'Body measure procedure', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Central obesity', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Height', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Personal Computers', 'Plethysmography', 'Population Study', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Skeletal system', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Sum', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Validation', 'abdominal fat', 'design', 'digital', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'photonics', 'reconstruction', 'size', 'subcutaneous', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'waist circumference']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2007,15000,0.010042439826646432
"Automatic Detection of Critical Dermoscopy Features for Melanoma Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malignant melanoma, with an estimated growth in incidence of about 6% per year for decades, causes considerable loss of life. Yet melanoma can be easily cured if detected early. Digital dermoscopy has shown promise for more accurate detection, particularly at an early stage. Recent conferences have highlighted a general agreement on definition of dermoscopic features and moderate agreement on the most useful structural features. Automatic detection of these specific structures that are critical for early diagnosis and are used in various dermoscopic diagnostic algorithms would be desirable. Yet little work has been published on automatic detection of any specific dermoscopic structures. Although specific colors figure prominently in the definition of the most critical dermoscopic structures, little work has been done on finding the specific regions or region combinations in the color space where colors are located, particularly with reference to the surrounding skin. The work in Phase I and after Phase I successfully segmented the border within 5% of the range of the dermatologists' borders, found several highly accurate dermoscopy features, and brought mean diagnostic accuracy on difficult early lesions to a high level. This proposal seeks to develop a digital dermosocopy system by 1) comparing classifiers 2) testing border accuracy and modifying segmentation if needed 3) developing an algorithm that uses a three-dimensional representation of a probability density function to specify single and paired melanoma colors via cluster methods and fuzzy logic techniques 4) identifying critical structural features including brown globules, abrupt border cutoff, granularity, regression, and pigment asymmetry with high accuracy 5) developing a clinical interface for acquisition of images within the clinic 6) testing the new algorithms in six dermatology clinics including two pigmented lesion clinics with both EpiLight and DermLite II Pro dermoscopy images taken in the clinic. Key features of the research include dermatopathology confirmation of specific structures and the use of relative color analysis. If successful, software will be marketed to the growing number of dermatologists with digital dermoscopy capability. The commercial software package will be ready for marketing as a diagnostic adjunct for digital camera dermoscopy attachments. Malignant melanoma, with an estimated growth in incidence of about 6% per year for decades, causes considerable loss of life. Melanoma can be easily cured if detected early, and this project seeks to develop a digital dermoscopy device that can detect very early melanomas. The project goal is to develop inexpensive melanoma detection software and test it in multiple dermatology clinics.          n/a",Automatic Detection of Critical Dermoscopy Features for Melanoma Diagnosis,7284886,R44CA101639,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Am 80', 'Amelanotic Melanoma', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Borderline Lesion', 'Boxing', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Cicatrix', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Count', 'Decision Trees', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermatology', 'Dermoscopy', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease regression', 'Dysplastic Nevus', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Hair', 'Hair Removal', 'Head', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Lentigo', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'N(delta)-acetylornithine, -isomer', 'N-dodecanoylglutamic acid, -isomer, sodium salt', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Physicians', 'Pigments', 'Precancerous melanosis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'ROC Curve', 'Radial', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Score', 'Series', 'Skin', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Work', 'alpha-difluoromethyl-DOPA, -isomer', 'alpha-methylornithine dihydrochloride, -isomer', 'base', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'melanoma', 'reconstruction', 'software development', 'software systems', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool development', 'vector']",NCI,STOECKER & ASSOCIATES,R44,2007,494442,-0.010686931287253412

"Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in imaging have revolutionized the biomedical investigation of illness. The tremendous potential that this methodology brings to advancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and in treatment of illnesses has as yet remained largely an unfulfilled promise. This potential has been limited by a number of technological impediments that could be in large part overcome by the availability of a federated imaging database and the attendant infrastructure. Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates.

"RESEARCH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA-- RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY DESCRIPTION: (adapted from the applicant?s abstract): Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are common problems in the general population. The Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for TMD were developed to establish specific operationalized examination procedures and diagnostic criteria for 8 Axis I biomedical diagnoses of TMD, as well as Axis II biobehavioral assessment procedures. Procedural reliability testing has been established for the RDC Axis I examination items, but full acceptance of the RDC requires confirmation of the temporal stability, validity, generalizability and clinical utility of the examination items, biomedical diagnoses, biobehavioral assessments, and general protocol. In order to accomplish these overall goals, a multi-center project is proposed that will first reassess at the University of Minnesota the reliability of 6 examiners (2 examiners each from 3 participating universities) to collect clinical Axis I examination data using the RDC operational definitions. In a second step, reliable blinded examiners will collect clinical examination data and formulate RDC diagnoses, which will be compared to criterion diagnoses made by an expert imaging. New clinical exam items will also be assessed. Subject to expert consensus, they will be added to yield a final exam protocol that will include all current RDC examination items as well as the new items. With this new protocol, the 6 examiners will continue examining normal and TMD subjects at their respective centers in order to test the temporal stability and diagnostic validity of the new and existing examination items, patient history items, and TMJ imaging by plain film and MRI. Discriminant analyses and decision tree analyses will be used to determine the best diagnostic algorithms for rendering RDC diagnoses. Masticatory muscle biopsies and TMJ synovial fluid will be collected from subjects at the University of Minnesota to evaluate biological markers for their role as potential mediators underlying the biomedical diagnoses. Simultaneously, Axis II biobehavioral assessment procedures will be tested for temporal reliability, compared with other accepted self-report instruments for concurrent validity, and, at two centers, evaluated for criterion validity against highly structured psychiatric interviews. The clinical and health services utility of adding Axis II biobehavioral assessments, imaging and biopsy results to Axis I clinical examination findings will be appraised. Advancement in our understanding of the prevalence, etiologies, natural progression, and treatment of TMD is dependent on having reliable and valid diagnostic criteria for these disorders. n/a",RESEARCH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA-- RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY,7072754,U01DE013331,"['biomarker', 'biopsy', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', 'facial muscles', 'gas chromatography mass spectrometry', 'human subject', 'inflammation', 'interview', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'mastication', 'musculoskeletal disorder diagnosis', 'oral facial pain', 'pain threshold', 'psychobiology', 'questionnaires', 'radioimmunoassay', 'sign /symptom', 'statistics /biometry', 'synovial fluid', 'temporomandibular joint syndrome', 'tissue /cell culture']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TWIN CITIES,U01,2006,371497,0.017694830464870005
"Spectral imaging for automated malignant blast counting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We propose to extend our successful development of an agile spectral light source for light microscopy, funded through the NCI-IMAT initiative, into FDA trials. The SpectraLamp(tm) device enables the automated and quantitative analysis of double-immunostained samples in brightfield (non-fluorescence-based) microscopy, with particular utility for hematopathology applications. A clinically compelling area is the enumeration of malignant blasts in bone marrow biopsy specimens of patients with acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myleloproliferative diseases for the purpose of staging and evaluating therapeutic responses. Current methods are inadequate due to poor sampling (typical of bone marrow aspirates) or difficulty in identifying true blasts (bone marrow biopsies and single-color immunohistochemical phenotyping). Double-immunophenotyping permits largely unambiguous detection, but such labeling strategies are not supported by standard (non-multispectral) color imaging systems. To overcome this limitation, we will combine our multispectral imaging system with a high-speed slide-scanning platform that can scan an entire bone-marrow biopsy at high resolution in under 3 minutes. Machine-learning software tools and spectral imaging will identify blasts, combining morphology parameters and double or even triple immunophenotyping to ensure accuracy and precision. After blasts are identified, flow-cytometrylike software will present the data in histograms and other modalities, allowing the user to ""gate"" on particular cellular populations and pull up panels of cell images for confirmation.      Time-line: Final equipment-related tasks will be accomplished in the first year and preliminary testing of the instrumentation and software features will occur in the second year, as will development of qualified panels of immunoreagents and staining protocols (by DAKOCytomation).

"Tomographic Imaging of Cochlear Micromechanical Motions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cochlea is a remarkable sensor: a living cochlea can reliably detect sounds that cause motions of the stapes on the order of picometers, is capable of high-quality frequency analysis (Q10dB > 600), and compresses the large dynamic range (120 dB) of hearing into the considerably smaller dynamic range (20- 50 dB) of neurons. It is now widely accepted that an active mechanical amplification process underlies these remarkable properties. However, there is considerable debate about the nature of the amplifier. While information on the cellular and molecular basis of hearing is increasing rapidly, there is still little understanding of how the components interoperate to generate the remarkable properties of hearing.       To date, the most successful experimental studies of cellular motions in living cochleae have used optical methods. However, current methods, such as laser Doppler vibrometry and video microscopy are limited by the low reflectivities of cochlear structures and the limited optical access provided by the intact cochea. The objective of this grant is to develop and apply a new tomographic imaging and motion measurement technique capable of determining the three-dimensional motions of all structures in a living, intact cochlea. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be used to obtain high-resolution images of the cochlea. Images will be acquired through a narrow opening similar to that used in laser Doppler vibrometry methods, or possibly directly through bone. Sequences of stroboscopic images will be generated with synchronous demodulation of the OCT detector signal during acoustic stimulation. Computer vision algorithms (similar to those used in video microscopy methods) will be used to determine motions with nanometer resolution. This technique will be applied to image and measure three-dimensional motions of the internal microstructure of an intact cochlea, including the basilar membrane, reticular lamina, tectorial membrane, and outer hair cells. n/a",Tomographic Imaging of Cochlear Micromechanical Motions,6985366,R21DC007111,"['animal tissue', 'auditory stimulus', 'biomechanics', 'cochlea', 'computer program /software', 'ear hair cell', 'guinea pigs', 'image processing', 'measurement', 'neuroimaging', 'optical tomography', 'organ of Corti', 'retina', 'technology /technique development', 'three dimensional imaging /topography', 'vibration', 'video microscopy']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2006,183324,0.02049525878986218

"Reconstruction Hardware for Real-Time Moving Tabel MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall goal of this project is to design and integrate instrumentation allowing the next generation of real-time image formation in MRI. The motivation comes from an existing project for forming MR images during continuous motion of the patient table. When applied to peripheral MR angiography the target is the formation of a moving table angiogram in which the table motion is precisely matched to the transit of the contrast bolus through the patient. However, implementation of this requires that a number of mathematical processes be done at high speed, including: (i) time-resolved 3D MRI of an extended field of view (FOV); (ii) determination of localized time-dependent parameters such as bolus arrival time and bolus velocity; (iii) variable ordering of phase encodings over the course of an MRI scan, allowing optimized local resolution; (iv) gradient warping correction for MR acquisition done using a moving patient table; (v) multi-coil reconstruction using the SENSE technique, allowing improved lateral resolution for a given acquisition time; (vi) MR acquisition done using a variable table velocity When implemented, these methods will allow the formation of peripheral MR angiograms with optimized, patient-specific table motion, maximum efficiency, and high spatial resolution. Specific aims are: 1. Construction of the Next Generation Real-Time Image MR Reconstruction System. The funding will allow the construction of a system enabling the real-time performance of the mathematical algorithms which perform the above processes. System design will allow the data acquisition and reconstruction to be modified in real time. 2. Incorporation of the New System into the Project of Moving Table MRA.

"Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Microscopy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will further develop and refine an innovative digital auto-focus technology for automated microscopy. Auto-focusing is essential to automated microscope imaging. Currently available techniques rely on various algorithms of focus computation at a single image resolution and suffer from inherent performance limitations, which affect their success and utilization in clinical and research applications. Auto-focusing for fluorescence microscopy, for example, represents a serious challenge to existing methods for desired accuracy, reliability and speed since in this case the images have very low signal-to-noise ratio and narrow depth-of-fields while specimen exposure to fluorescent excitation must be minimized to avoid photo-bleaching and formation of undesirable substances such as free radicals and singlet oxygen. We propose a novel multi-resolution image analysis approach to microscope auto-focusing, based on the recently developed mathematical theory of wavelet transform. The new approach overcomes a number of inherent limitations of currently available techniques, and holds the promise to make the measurement of the microscope focus function and the detection of best-focus imaging position considerably more accurate, reliable, and fast. This innovative technology will significantly increase the ability and efficacy of automated microscope instruments for a wide range of clinical and research applications where a large number of specimens need to be imaged and quantitatively analyzed on a routine basis. During the Phase 1 project we investigated the feasibility of the proposed technology for fluorescence microscopy. We developed software to implement the algorithms for multi-resolution focus function measurements and for in-focus imaging position search. We evaluated the new approach in software simulation on a variety of sample image stacks of cytogenetic FISH specimens, and compared it with all current best-performing methods for microscope auto-focusing using the criteria of (1) accuracy, (2) range, (3) robustness, and (4) speed. The Phase 1 results suggest that, by using a proper wavelet-based auto-focus function, the new multi-resolution method significantly outperforms all competing methods in each of the aforementioned performance categories, and clearly exceeds the Phase 1 feasibility criteria. In the Phase 2 project, we will further develop, refine, integrate, and validate the new technology in real-time operation environment. We plan to build a prototype system with multi-resolution auto-focusing capabilities for both fluorescence and bright-field microscope imaging. We will evaluate the system extensively for a variety of applications including genetics, pathology, and cytology. We will beta test the new system and technology in routine clinical laboratory environment and optimize the technology as end user input and feedbacks are gathered. Once fully developed and qualified, this new technology will be patented and incorporated into future IRIS automated imaging cytometry instruments. It will also be made commercially available to Applied Imaging Corporation and other manufacturers of automated microscope instruments through licensing agreements and partnerships.           n/a",Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Microscopy,6951446,R44RR016817,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'digital imaging', 'flow cytometry', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'fluorescent in situ hybridization', 'human data', 'image enhancement', 'image processing', 'mathematical model']",NCRR,"ADVANCED DIGITAL IMAGING RESEARCH, LLC",R44,2005,318350,0.038202142794623785
"Computer Imaging to Diminish Alopecia Distress    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The goal of the research proposed herein is to develop a low-cost, user-friendly, computer-based imaging system for use by women to reduce anxiety and distress relating to alopecia (hair loss) prior to or following chemotherapy. It has been reported that 47 percent to 58 percent of women with cancer cite the likelihood of alopecia as the most disturbing anticipated aspect of receiving chemotherapy; 8 percent stated that they seriously considered refusing treatment due to this possibility. Utilizing advanced graphical processing techniques, the proposed ""Help for Alopecia through Image Representations"" (HAIR) system will permit cancer patients of all races and ethnicities to interactively visualize, using their own image, the process of hair loss, accessorization options (e.g., wigs, head scarves, hats, etc.), and the corresponding stages of hair regrowth. ""Scripting"" (i.e., rehearsing) the side effects of chemotherapy and potential patient responses will significantly reduce the anxiety caused by the prospect of alopecia. This will serve to desensitize women to alopecia, allow them to make better informed treatment decisions, and facilitate coping when it occurs.            n/a",Computer Imaging to Diminish Alopecia Distress,6935840,R44CA099873,"['Internet', 'alopecia', 'anxiety', 'artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'breast neoplasms', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'coping', 'desensitization psychotherapy', 'drug adverse effect', 'female', 'human subject', 'imaging /visualization /scanning', 'neoplasm /cancer chemotherapy', 'patient oriented research', 'psychological aspect of cancer', 'quality of life', 'women&apos', 's health']",NCI,"BARRON ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2005,399984,-0.014742133106468288
"RESEARCH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA-- RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY DESCRIPTION: (adapted from the applicant?s abstract): Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are common problems in the general population. The Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for TMD were developed to establish specific operationalized examination procedures and diagnostic criteria for 8 Axis I biomedical diagnoses of TMD, as well as Axis II biobehavioral assessment procedures. Procedural reliability testing has been established for the RDC Axis I examination items, but full acceptance of the RDC requires confirmation of the temporal stability, validity, generalizability and clinical utility of the examination items, biomedical diagnoses, biobehavioral assessments, and general protocol. In order to accomplish these overall goals, a multi-center project is proposed that will first reassess at the University of Minnesota the reliability of 6 examiners (2 examiners each from 3 participating universities) to collect clinical Axis I examination data using the RDC operational definitions. In a second step, reliable blinded examiners will collect clinical examination data and formulate RDC diagnoses, which will be compared to criterion diagnoses made by an expert imaging. New clinical exam items will also be assessed. Subject to expert consensus, they will be added to yield a final exam protocol that will include all current RDC examination items as well as the new items. With this new protocol, the 6 examiners will continue examining normal and TMD subjects at their respective centers in order to test the temporal stability and diagnostic validity of the new and existing examination items, patient history items, and TMJ imaging by plain film and MRI. Discriminant analyses and decision tree analyses will be used to determine the best diagnostic algorithms for rendering RDC diagnoses. Masticatory muscle biopsies and TMJ synovial fluid will be collected from subjects at the University of Minnesota to evaluate biological markers for their role as potential mediators underlying the biomedical diagnoses. Simultaneously, Axis II biobehavioral assessment procedures will be tested for temporal reliability, compared with other accepted self-report instruments for concurrent validity, and, at two centers, evaluated for criterion validity against highly structured psychiatric interviews. The clinical and health services utility of adding Axis II biobehavioral assessments, imaging and biopsy results to Axis I clinical examination findings will be appraised. Advancement in our understanding of the prevalence, etiologies, natural progression, and treatment of TMD is dependent on having reliable and valid diagnostic criteria for these disorders. n/a",RESEARCH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA-- RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY,6901098,U01DE013331,"['biomarker', 'biopsy', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', 'facial muscles', 'gas chromatography mass spectrometry', 'human subject', 'inflammation', 'interview', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'mastication', 'musculoskeletal disorder diagnosis', 'oral facial pain', 'pain threshold', 'psychobiology', 'questionnaires', 'radioimmunoassay', 'sign /symptom', 'statistics /biometry', 'synovial fluid', 'temporomandibular joint syndrome', 'tissue /cell culture']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TWIN CITIES,U01,2005,1520994,0.017694830464870005
"Spectral imaging for automated malignant blast counting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We propose to extend our successful development of an agile spectral light source for light microscopy, funded through the NCI-IMAT initiative, into FDA trials. The SpectraLamp(tm) device enables the automated and quantitative analysis of double-immunostained samples in brightfield (non-fluorescence-based) microscopy, with particular utility for hematopathology applications. A clinically compelling area is the enumeration of malignant blasts in bone marrow biopsy specimens of patients with acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myleloproliferative diseases for the purpose of staging and evaluating therapeutic responses. Current methods are inadequate due to poor sampling (typical of bone marrow aspirates) or difficulty in identifying true blasts (bone marrow biopsies and single-color immunohistochemical phenotyping). Double-immunophenotyping permits largely unambiguous detection, but such labeling strategies are not supported by standard (non-multispectral) color imaging systems. To overcome this limitation, we will combine our multispectral imaging system with a high-speed slide-scanning platform that can scan an entire bone-marrow biopsy at high resolution in under 3 minutes. Machine-learning software tools and spectral imaging will identify blasts, combining morphology parameters and double or even triple immunophenotyping to ensure accuracy and precision. After blasts are identified, flow-cytometrylike software will present the data in histograms and other modalities, allowing the user to ""gate"" on particular cellular populations and pull up panels of cell images for confirmation.      Time-line: Final equipment-related tasks will be accomplished in the first year and preliminary testing of the instrumentation and software features will occur in the second year, as will development of qualified panels of immunoreagents and staining protocols (by DAKOCytomation).

"National Alliance-Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC)(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The National Alliance for Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC) is a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, software engineers, and medical investigators who develop computational tools for the analysis and visualization of medical image data. The purpose of the center is to provide the infrastructure and environment for the development of computational algorithms and open source technologies, and then oversee the training and dissemination of these tools to the medical research community. This world-class software and development environment serves as a foundation for accelerating the development and deployment of computational tools that are readily accessible to the medical research community. The team combines cutting-edge computer vision research (to create medical imaging analysis algorithms) with state-of-the-art software engineering techniques (based on ""extreme"" programming techniques in a distributed, open-source environment) to enable computational examination of both basic neuroscience and neurological disorders. In developing this infrastructure resource, the team will significantly expand upon proven open systems technology and platforms. The driving biological projects will come initially from the study of schizophrenia, but the methods will be applicable to many other diseases. The computational tools and open systems technologies and platforms developed by NAMIC will initially be used to study anatomical structures and connectivity patterns in the brain, derangements of which have long been thought to play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia. The overall analysis will occur at a range of scales, and will occur across a range of modalities including diffusion MRI, quantitative EGG, and metabolic and receptor PET, but potentially including microscopic, genomic, and other image data. It will apply to image data from individual patients, and to studies executed across large populations. The data will be taken from subjects across a wide range of time scales and ultimately apply to a broad range of diseases in a broad range of organs.             n/a",National Alliance-Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC)(RMI),6950028,U54EB005149,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'bioinformatics', 'clinical research', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'cooperative study']",NIBIB,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U54,2005,3800000,0.02784312282865637
"Tomographic Imaging of Cochlear Micromechanical Motions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cochlea is a remarkable sensor: a living cochlea can reliably detect sounds that cause motions of the stapes on the order of picometers, is capable of high-quality frequency analysis (Q10dB > 600), and compresses the large dynamic range (120 dB) of hearing into the considerably smaller dynamic range (20- 50 dB) of neurons. It is now widely accepted that an active mechanical amplification process underlies these remarkable properties. However, there is considerable debate about the nature of the amplifier. While information on the cellular and molecular basis of hearing is increasing rapidly, there is still little understanding of how the components interoperate to generate the remarkable properties of hearing.       To date, the most successful experimental studies of cellular motions in living cochleae have used optical methods. However, current methods, such as laser Doppler vibrometry and video microscopy are limited by the low reflectivities of cochlear structures and the limited optical access provided by the intact cochea. The objective of this grant is to develop and apply a new tomographic imaging and motion measurement technique capable of determining the three-dimensional motions of all structures in a living, intact cochlea. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be used to obtain high-resolution images of the cochlea. Images will be acquired through a narrow opening similar to that used in laser Doppler vibrometry methods, or possibly directly through bone. Sequences of stroboscopic images will be generated with synchronous demodulation of the OCT detector signal during acoustic stimulation. Computer vision algorithms (similar to those used in video microscopy methods) will be used to determine motions with nanometer resolution. This technique will be applied to image and measure three-dimensional motions of the internal microstructure of an intact cochlea, including the basilar membrane, reticular lamina, tectorial membrane, and outer hair cells. n/a",Tomographic Imaging of Cochlear Micromechanical Motions,6850297,R21DC007111,"['animal tissue', 'auditory stimulus', 'biomechanics', 'cochlea', 'computer program /software', 'ear hair cell', 'guinea pigs', 'image processing', 'measurement', 'neuroimaging', 'optical tomography', 'organ of Corti', 'retina', 'technology /technique development', 'three dimensional imaging /topography', 'vibration', 'video microscopy']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2005,172385,0.02049525878986218
"Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in imaging have revolutionized the biomedical investigation of illness. The tremendous potential that this methodology brings to advancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and in treatment of illnesses has as yet remained largely an unfulfilled promise. This potential has been limited by a number of technological impediments that could be in large part overcome by the availability of a federated imaging database and the attendant infrastructure. Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates. These broad areas of work will come together in through key collaborations that will ensure utilization promotion by facilitating data entry into the federated database and creation of database incentive functionality.

"Sub-millimeter Simultaneous SPECT-CT for Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We are proposing to develop a single, bench-top animal scanner that will acquire both functional SPECT images and anatomical CT images with sub-millimeter spatial resolution for both imaging modalities. The sub-mm SPECT-CT will provide a technique for noninvasive functional imaging in mice for a wide range of applications, including the development of new radio-pharmaceuticals, assessment of new therapeutic approaches, and investigation of fundamental biological processes in transgenic and knockout mice. This would allow investigators to perform serial imaging studies in the same animal at multiple time points to investigate tumor growth, tissue pathology, the effects of therapy, and the mechanism of action of new diagnostic agents. The system will have wide applicability and significant impact in research that uses small animals to advance our understanding of human disease processes.

In addition, we acquired outstanding dual SPECT-CT images of euthanized mice.

We propose a novel multi-resolution image analysis approach to microscope auto-focusing, based on the recently developed mathematical theory of wavelet transform. The new approach overcomes a number of inherent limitations of currently available techniques, and holds the promise to make the measurement of the microscope focus function and the detection of best-focus imaging position considerably more accurate, reliable, and fast. This innovative technology will significantly increase the ability and efficacy of automated microscope instruments for a wide range of clinical and research applications where a large number of specimens need to be imaged and quantitatively analyzed on a routine basis. During the Phase 1 project we investigated the feasibility of the proposed technology for fluorescence microscopy. We developed software to implement the algorithms for multi-resolution focus function measurements and for in-focus imaging position search. We evaluated the new approach in software simulation on a variety of sample image stacks of cytogenetic FISH specimens, and compared it with all current best-performing methods for microscope auto-focusing using the criteria of (1) accuracy, (2) range, (3) robustness, and (4) speed. The Phase 1 results suggest that, by using a proper wavelet-based auto-focus function, the new multi-resolution method significantly outperforms all competing methods in each of the aforementioned performance categories, and clearly exceeds the Phase 1 feasibility criteria. In the Phase 2 project, we will further develop, refine, integrate, and validate the new technology in real-time operation environment. We plan to build a prototype system with multi-resolution auto-focusing capabilities for both fluorescence and bright-field microscope imaging. We will evaluate the system extensively for a variety of applications including genetics, pathology, and cytology. We will beta test the new system and technology in routine clinical laboratory environment and optimize the technology as end user input and feedbacks are gathered. Once fully developed and qualified, this new technology will be patented and incorporated into future IRIS automated imaging cytometry instruments. It will also be made commercially available to Applied Imaging Corporation and other manufacturers of automated microscope instruments through licensing agreements and partnerships.           n/a",Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Microscopy,6833120,R44RR016817,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'digital imaging', 'flow cytometry', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'fluorescent in situ hybridization', 'human data', 'image enhancement', 'image processing', 'mathematical model']",NCRR,"ADVANCED DIGITAL IMAGING RESEARCH, LLC",R44,2004,427818,0.038202142794623785

"RESEARCH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA-- RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY DESCRIPTION: (adapted from the applicant?s abstract): Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are common problems in the general population. The Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for TMD were developed to establish specific operationalized examination procedures and diagnostic criteria for 8 Axis I biomedical diagnoses of TMD, as well as Axis II biobehavioral assessment procedures. Procedural reliability testing has been established for the RDC Axis I examination items, but full acceptance of the RDC requires confirmation of the temporal stability, validity, generalizability and clinical utility of the examination items, biomedical diagnoses, biobehavioral assessments, and general protocol. In order to accomplish these overall goals, a multi-center project is proposed that will first reassess at the University of Minnesota the reliability of 6 examiners (2 examiners each from 3 participating universities) to collect clinical Axis I examination data using the RDC operational definitions. In a second step, reliable blinded examiners will collect clinical examination data and formulate RDC diagnoses, which will be compared to criterion diagnoses made by an expert imaging. New clinical exam items will also be assessed. Subject to expert consensus, they will be added to yield a final exam protocol that will include all current RDC examination items as well as the new items. With this new protocol, the 6 examiners will continue examining normal and TMD subjects at their respective centers in order to test the temporal stability and diagnostic validity of the new and existing examination items, patient history items, and TMJ imaging by plain film and MRI. Discriminant analyses and decision tree analyses will be used to determine the best diagnostic algorithms for rendering RDC diagnoses. Masticatory muscle biopsies and TMJ synovial fluid will be collected from subjects at the University of Minnesota to evaluate biological markers for their role as potential mediators underlying the biomedical diagnoses. Simultaneously, Axis II biobehavioral assessment procedures will be tested for temporal reliability, compared with other accepted self-report instruments for concurrent validity, and, at two centers, evaluated for criterion validity against highly structured psychiatric interviews. The clinical and health services utility of adding Axis II biobehavioral assessments, imaging and biopsy results to Axis I clinical examination findings will be appraised. Advancement in our understanding of the prevalence, etiologies, natural progression, and treatment of TMD is dependent on having reliable and valid diagnostic criteria for these disorders. n/a",RESEARCH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA-- RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY,6773915,U01DE013331,"['biomarker', 'biopsy', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', 'facial muscles', 'gas chromatography mass spectrometry', 'human subject', 'inflammation', 'interview', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'mastication', 'musculoskeletal disorder diagnosis', 'oral facial pain', 'pain threshold', 'psychobiology', 'questionnaires', 'radioimmunoassay', 'sign /symptom', 'statistics /biometry', 'synovial fluid', 'temporomandibular joint syndrome', 'tissue /cell culture']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TWIN CITIES,U01,2004,1637046,0.017694830464870005

The purpose of the center is to provide the infrastructure and environment for the development of computational algorithms and open source technologies, and then oversee the training and dissemination of these tools to the medical research community. This world-class software and development environment serves as a foundation for accelerating the development and deployment of computational tools that are readily accessible to the medical research community. The team combines cutting-edge computer vision research (to create medical imaging analysis algorithms) with state-of-the-art software engineering techniques (based on ""extreme"" programming techniques in a distributed, open-source environment) to enable computational examination of both basic neuroscience and neurological disorders. In developing this infrastructure resource, the team will significantly expand upon proven open systems technology and platforms. The driving biological projects will come initially from the study of schizophrenia, but the methods will be applicable to many other diseases. The computational tools and open systems technologies and platforms developed by NAMIC will initially be used to study anatomical structures and connectivity patterns in the brain, derangements of which have long been thought to play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia. The overall analysis will occur at a range of scales, and will occur across a range of modalities including diffusion MRI, quantitative EGG, and metabolic and receptor PET, but potentially including microscopic, genomic, and other image data. It will apply to image data from individual patients, and to studies executed across large populations.

"Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in imaging have revolutionized the biomedical investigation of illness. The tremendous potential that this methodology brings to advancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and in treatment of illnesses has as yet remained largely an unfulfilled promise. This potential has been limited by a number of technological impediments that could be in large part overcome by the availability of a federated imaging database and the attendant infrastructure. Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates. These broad areas of work will come together in through key collaborations that will ensure utilization promotion by facilitating data entry into the federated database and creation of database incentive functionality. Our participating sites include MGH (PI), BWH, UCI, Duke, UCLA, UCSD, John Hopkins, and newly added Washington University and MIT. We have made a concerted effort to bridge the gap that can exist between biomedical and computational sciences by recruiting to our group leaders in both of these domains. Our efforts will be coordinated with those of the entire BIRN consortium in order to insure that acquisition and database functionality, and application-based disorder queries are interoperable across sites and designed to advance the capabilities to further knowledge and understanding of health and disease.         n/a",Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network,6909355,U24RR021382,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'bioinformatics', 'clinical research', 'computational biology', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'cooperative study', 'data management', 'human subject', 'imaging /visualization /scanning', 'information systems', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'method development', 'molecular biology information system', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychology']",NCRR,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U24,2004,3821536,0.019528325215782624

The workshop format for the last decade has                generally involved three days of high-quality presentations and investigator         interaction, both formally and informally at evening meeting receptions held         at the Cosmos Club.  The 30th meeting will be held from October 10-12, 2001,         and focus on Time-Varying Imagery.  This has particular relevance to medical         imaging, as it is increasingly being used to describe intrinsically-varying          physiologic phenomena (e.g., blood flow, intra-operative conditions).  The           goals of the meeting are the following: to provide technology transfer among         the three groups and to demonstrate the complementary capabilities of the            groups.  This is especially important in the area of validation of algorithms,       and the consequent need for databases that permit that validation.  Among the        specific topics to be covered at this meeting are: Real-time event                   understanding,  Extraction of information from video, video compression and          decompression, and hand and body gesture recognition.

"Sub-millimeter Simultaneous SPECT-CT for Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We are proposing to develop a single, bench-top animal scanner that will acquire both functional SPECT images and anatomical CT images with sub-millimeter spatial resolution for both imaging modalities.

This would allow investigators to perform serial imaging studies in the same animal at multiple time points to investigate tumor growth, tissue pathology, the effects of therapy, and the mechanism of action of new diagnostic agents. The system will have wide applicability and significant impact in research that uses small animals to advance our understanding of human disease processes.

"Rapid Cancer-Treatment Efficacy Monitoring System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evaluating cancer therapy efficacy by studying symptomatic improvement in patient condition is a popular practice due to the lack of rapid, reliable and robust quantitative evaluation protocols for routine clinical measurement of cancer therapy efficacy. Reducing time required for arriving at decisions and reducing cost without compromising accuracy could provide potentially improved treatments especially for patients with advanced leukemia of various types. This proposal focuses on rapid quantitative assessment of cancer treatment efficacy for leukemia. The proposed approach is based on quantifying apoptosis (programmed cell death) and has been shown to be one of the most reliable and one of the earliest indicators for assessing anticancer efficacy of a drug. Several other techniques are available to detect apoptosis (Agarose gel electrophoresis, Caspase-3, TUNEL assay, Morphological estimation, Annexin V assays etc). However, these techniques are inaccurate, expensive or time consuming.      A recently developed a two stage DNA diffusion assay holds promise to be an accurate, relatively inexpensive and rapid methodology for quantitative apoptosis measurement via the apoptotic index. The two stages are:(1) slide preparation and microscopy imaging, which requires approximately 1.5 hrs and (2) image analysis, which is tedious, and takes approximately 2 hours of additional intensive manual labor leading to errors in categorization of the cells. We propose to fully automate the second stage with the goal to minimize manual effort and there by reduce the human errors. This would also make the procedure more reproducible. Phase I work will involve: (1) segmentation and classification algorithm development for automatic apoptotic index calculation, and (2) characterizing the algorithm performance by inducing apoptosis in leukemia cells in culture using known apoptosis inducing agents. n/a",Rapid Cancer-Treatment Efficacy Monitoring System,6643057,R43CA101292,"['apoptosis', ' artificial intelligence', ' automated health care system', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical automation', ' computer program /software', ' fluorescence microscopy', ' image processing', ' leukemia', ' patient care management', ' prognosis', ' technology /technique development', ' tissue /cell culture']",NCI,INSIGHTFUL CORPORATION,R43,2003,99644,-0.014101028074859944
"Vessel Segmentation/Registration from Ultrasound Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Ultrasound is widely used for imaging of blood vessels as it is non-invasive, real-time, and relatively inexpensive. This proposal focuses on segmentation of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) from ultrasound images with extension to other vascular imaging applications in the long term. Reliable quantitative evaluation of AAAs plays a pivotal role in diagnoses and frequent follow-up studies needed to avoid life-threatening rupture. These studies require vessel segmentation (for size analysis) and registration between serial studies (for monitoring the progression of the disease before and/or after vascular repair). AAA evaluation is routinely carried out for both high-risk patient populations and those treated with endovascular repair. Currently, AAA management is primarily based on measurements from two-dimensional (2-D) slices in CT scans. AAA monitoring and follow-up could be improved by 1) measurement from 3-D reconstructions, and 2) use of ultrasound imaging to minimize radiation exposure and reduce costs. 3-D ultrasound reconstructions provide accuracy comparable to that of CT. However, large inter-observer variability and long processing times preclude routine clinical use of 3-D image information. This research aims to develop software solutions for improved ultrasound-based AAA monitoring and other vascular diseases (in the long term). The tools used will be based on advanced image segmentation and registration algorithms involving curvature-driven image processing techniques and deformable models. The goal of the Phase I study is to establish feasibility of the proposed methods by demonstrating an improvement in the repeatability and accuracy of measurements and reduction in delineation time.         n/a",Vessel Segmentation/Registration from Ultrasound Images,6641019,R43HL069540,"['abdomen', ' aorta aneurysm', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' gastrointestinal circulation disorder', ' gastrointestinal imaging /visualization', ' human data', ' mathematics', ' three dimensional imaging /topography']",NHLBI,INSIGHTFUL CORPORATION,R43,2003,99621,0.036454637247926865
"Automated Quantitation of 3D Echocardiograms In Phase I we developed a method for automated border detection (ABD) of echocardiographic scans that is feasible for clinical application. The accuracy of our processes provides exceeds Phase I goals and is comparable to interobserver variability in measuring volume and ejection fraction, and in border location. For a diverse set of patients, we have achieved an accuracy of 10 ml for endocardial volume, 4% for ejection fraction, and ,2.0 mm for border position. Our processes operates in 4 min. In Phase II we propose to continue research and development to move our ABD technology closer to clinical user. Our first specific aim is to reduce the amount of manual input required even further. Our second aim is to develop a prototype system suitable for clinical evaluation. Our third aim is to perform a pilot trial to evaluate the performance of our ABD process, as a preparation for a more formal, multi-center clinical trial planned for Phase III.

"Novel Methods for Automated Key Image Selection    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Significant new knowledge about human behavior and the brain has come to light in recent years, due in part to rapid technical developments in imaging. As the role of imaging becomes increasingly important in neurosciences, effective methods for managing and retrieving images will become even more critical; without such advances, further progress will be hindered. The goal of this proposal is the automated summarization of large imaging sets. Image summarization proffers a method to compress imaging studies by selecting only pertinent image slices that objectively document a patient's condition; as such, its applications include multimedia electronic medical records, telemedicine, and teaching files. In Phase I, development is focused on a customizable brain atlas used for registering patient imaging studies in order to select key images. This phase addresses selection of images from ""normal"" studies and studies with only subtle morphological changes, as typical of most patients with psychiatric disorders. Automatic techniques for customizing the atlas to imaging study acquisition parameters are developed, in addition to registration methods for mapping the atlas to the patient's original study. Building from this initial work, Phase II expands to encompass selection of images from ""abnormal"" studies that exhibit gross morphological changes through principle component analysis, further customization of the atlas for different age groups (e.g., pediatric), and incorporation of structured data entry (SDE) and natural language processing (NLP) of medical reports to help guide automatic selection of key images. The resultant product will be a fully automated software system that can select relevant images from any imaging study.

Procedural reliability testing has been established for the RDC Axis I examination items, but full acceptance of the RDC requires confirmation of the temporal stability, validity, generalizability and clinical utility of the examination items, biomedical diagnoses, biobehavioral assessments, and general protocol. In order to accomplish these overall goals, a multi-center project is proposed that will first reassess at the University of Minnesota the reliability of 6 examiners (2 examiners each from 3 participating universities) to collect clinical Axis I examination data using the RDC operational definitions. In a second step, reliable blinded examiners will collect clinical examination data and formulate RDC diagnoses, which will be compared to criterion diagnoses made by an expert imaging. New clinical exam items will also be assessed. Subject to expert consensus, they will be added to yield a final exam protocol that will include all current RDC examination items as well as the new items. With this new protocol, the 6 examiners will continue examining normal and TMD subjects at their respective centers in order to test the temporal stability and diagnostic validity of the new and existing examination items, patient history items, and TMJ imaging by plain film and MRI. Discriminant analyses and decision tree analyses will be used to determine the best diagnostic algorithms for rendering RDC diagnoses. Masticatory muscle biopsies and TMJ synovial fluid will be collected from subjects at the University of Minnesota to evaluate biological markers for their role as potential mediators underlying the biomedical diagnoses.

"Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop   DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant):                                                 The Applied Imagery, Pattern Recognition (AIPR) Workshop is held annually in         Washington, D.C., at the Cosmos Club.  This workshop brings together 60-80           members of academia, industry, and other federal agencies, with a particular         history of involvement with the broader intelligence community in image              processing and analysis.  The workshop format for the last decade has                generally involved three days of high-quality presentations and investigator         interaction, both formally and informally at evening meeting receptions held         at the Cosmos Club.  The 30th meeting will be held from October 10-12, 2001,         and focus on Time-Varying Imagery.  This has particular relevance to medical         imaging, as it is increasingly being used to describe intrinsically-varying          physiologic phenomena (e.g., blood flow, intra-operative conditions).  The           goals of the meeting are the following: to provide technology transfer among         the three groups and to demonstrate the complementary capabilities of the            groups.  This is especially important in the area of validation of algorithms,       and the consequent need for databases that permit that validation.  Among the        specific topics to be covered at this meeting are: Real-time event                   understanding,  Extraction of information from video, video compression and          decompression, and hand and body gesture recognition.  A five-year period of         support is requested, to enable the meeting to grow in participation and             breadth of disciplines attracted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              n/a",Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop,6522796,R13CA093819,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer human interaction', ' videotape /videodisc', ' workshop']",NCI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R13,2002,5000,0.011285167254859578
"Ultrasonic Registration of Knee Anatomy to MRI Images  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will investigate the feasibility of using intra-operative ultrasound (US) images to noninvasively register the bone surfaces of the knee to preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) images. A surgical navigation system, KneeNav, is being developed by CASurgica for intraoperatively planning the proper location of ligament attachment sites and drill tunnel locations and then guiding the surgeon to execute the plan. Despite agreement on the correct points of insertion, great variability exists in tunnel placement among surgeons and the rate of misplaced tunnels in ACL reconstruction surgery has been reported to be between 10-40 percent. Malpositioning of the bone tunnels is the main reason for revision surgery. The proposed research would increase the accuracy of the procedure versus current videoscopic techniques or versus competitive image guidance systems. The research plan is to establish a ""gold standard"" for registration accuracy using reconstructed CT scans, point-based surface matching algorithms, and optical tracking. Reconstructed MR models will be substituted for CT models and the accuracy reassessed. The US probe will then be calibrated and US surface collection will then be substituted for point based collection and the accuracy reassessed. Finally, registration of US directly to MR without reconstruction will be assessed.

"Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Cytogenetics The goal of this project is to develop innovative digital microscope autofocusing techniques for automated cytogenetics applications.  We propose a novel multi-resolution image analysis approach to focus measurement and detection, based on the recently developed mathematical theory of wavelet transform.  In comparison to currently available single-resolution techniques, the proposed method overcomes their fundamental limitations and promises considerably more accurate, reliable and faster means to compute and determine in-focus image position for image acquisition.  This will significantly increase the ability and efficacy of automated scanning microscope instruments for clinical and cancer cytogenetics applications. In Phase 1 we will investigate the feasibility of the proposed method based on its utilization in fluorescence microscopy.  We will develop and implement the algorithm and software for multi-resolution focus function computation and in-focus position determination.  We will test and evaluate the new method against the current best-performing algorithms by comparing (1) Accuracy; (2)  Range; (3)  Insensitivity to other parameters; and (4)  Speed. If the new approach achieves superior performance, in Phase 2 the technique will be further developed and extended to bright-field microscopy applications.  When fully developed, the new technology will be made available to Applied Imaging (AIC) for integration into the PowerGene cytogenetics automation products. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: As soon as the new techniques are developed and qualified for routine application, they will be made available to AIC for incorporation into the PowerGene product line of cytogenetics automation equipment, both in new systems sold and as an upgrade to existing systems already in use in cytogenetics labs, thus commercializing the technology quickly. n/a",Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Cytogenetics,6443502,R43RR016817,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical automation', ' clinical research', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' cytogenetics', ' digital imaging', ' fluorescence microscopy', ' fluorescent in situ hybridization', ' human data', ' image enhancement', ' image processing', ' mathematical model']",NCRR,"ADVANCED DIGITAL IMAGING RESEARCH, LLC",R43,2002,91727,0.021369903096542655
"Automated Quantitation of 3D Echocardiograms In Phase I we developed a method for automated border detection (ABD) of echocardiographic scans that is feasible for clinical application. The accuracy of our processes provides exceeds Phase I goals and is comparable to interobserver variability in measuring volume and ejection fraction, and in border location. For a diverse set of patients, we have achieved an accuracy of 10 ml for endocardial volume, 4% for ejection fraction, and ,2.0 mm for border position. Our processes operates in 4 min. In Phase II we propose to continue research and development to move our ABD technology closer to clinical user. Our first specific aim is to reduce the amount of manual input required even further. Our second aim is to develop a prototype system suitable for clinical evaluation. Our third aim is to perform a pilot trial to evaluate the performance of our ABD process, as a preparation for a more formal, multi-center clinical trial planned for Phase III. The proposed research is important because quantitative 3D echo provides greater accuracy and reproducibility and more comprehensive information on cardiac status than currently available imaging techniques. The significant advantages of 3D echo are not currently available for clinical practice because it is impractical without automation. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Automation of echocardiogram border detection enables physicians to obtain accurate, reproducible and comprehensive measurements of the heart's size, shape and function. This technology can be included in ultrasound systems or provided in workstations.

"Deployment Framework for Medical Imaging Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are many reasons for the relatively slow proliferation of advanced medical image processing methods but a significant reason is the present paradigm for providing access: most applications are still tied to proprietary software and hardware environments that carry significant up-front costs. The ultimate intent of this work is leverage commodity computing technologies to develop an open, extensible framework for deploying medical image processing applications in the heterogeneous, networked computing environment of today. The framework will provide clinicians and researchers access to state-of-the-art image processing applications regardless of their particular computing platform or locally available computing resources connecting them with federated database resources, with high-end computing resources, or even with their colleagues in a peer-to-peer computing environment. The aims for Phase I of this project are: (1) Demonstrate that the framework provides access to image processing applications to an extent that is largely independent of local computing resources. (2) Demonstrate that the framework is general in that the same components can be reused for deploying a wide variety of medical imaging applications. (3) Demonstrate that the framework is customizable both by third-party developers and by end-users allowing power-users to both create and deploy new applications. Work in Phase II will extend the framework and develop two-demonstration applications--computer aided diagnosis (CAD) for mammography and multimodality image fusion. The ultimate goal is to obtain key partnerships and the private equity investment necessary for commercialization, which will proceed by launching revenue-generating versions of the CAD and image fusion applications. n/a",Deployment Framework for Medical Imaging Applications,6494576,R44EB000149,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' clinical research', ' computed axial tomography', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer human interaction', ' computer network', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' human data', ' image processing', ' mammography', ' mathematics', ' positron emission tomography', ' telemedicine']",NIBIB,"FRONTIER MEDICAL, LLC",R44,2002,143577,-0.004460999465020997

"ENERGY RESOLVED DIGITAL HPGE X OR Y-RAY IMAGING DETECTOR Imaging detectors for 10 to 150 keV photons have many uses in medical technology, including tumor imaging, SPECT, and radiography. Digital output is particularly useful since it allows image enhancement, analysis, transmission and storage. In Phase I we proposed a new technology that could capture images with 100 microm spatial resolution and 1 keV energy resolution or better. This capability would facilitate entirely new classes of medical diagnostic procedures, particularly for transgenic small animal imaging. Our Phase I work demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In this Phase II effort, collaborating with Paul Luke at LBNL, we will construct 1 cm thick crossed-strip HPGe detectors having 10 x 10 strips, each 2 mm x 20 mm. We will develop cooled FET preamplifiers having low noise and large bandwidth properties specifically required by this approach. We will also develop analog filtering electronics to condition the detector's novel signals and employ digital pulse processing electronics to acquire these signals at rates up to 10/6 cps. Finally, we will devise procedures to test the detector's linearity and develop processing algorithms to perfect this quality. Phase II will conclude with a working and tested prototype. Phase III will entail primarily production engineering efforts. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: As an energy resolved digital detector with 100 microm spatial resolution, the proposed detector technology could find many medical applications, including SPECT, energy resolved angiography for small mammals, bone densitometry on rodent bones, and small, hand-held gamma cameras. Non-medical applications would include non-destructive testing, astrophysical gamma imaging, nuclear cleanup uses, and x-ray diffraction detectors.  n/a",ENERGY RESOLVED DIGITAL HPGE X OR Y-RAY IMAGING DETECTOR,6376544,R44CA075844,"['X ray', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' cadmium', ' clinical biomedical equipment', ' digital imaging', ' gamma radiation', ' tellurium', ' zinc']",NCI,X-RAY INSTRUMENTATION ASSOCIATES,R44,2001,373949,0.016734782082499452
"COMPUTER-ASSISTED CHEST RADIOGRAPH READER The long term objective of this phase is to provide a means for reducing inter- and intra- reader variability in diagnosing interstitial lung diseases in chest radiographs through a computer-based system for analyzing digital images. The Computer-assisted Chest Radiograph Reader System (CARRS) applies recognized principles in the psychophysics of human vision, incorporates neural network-based image analysis and integrates these with a graphical user interface. Advances in digital image processing, and classification techniques have made CARRS feasible for meeting screening, research arid development, and clinical requirements. CARRS will implement the International Labor Organization (ILO) classification procedures. The specific aims of this project are to implement enhancements to  the CARRS prototype developed in Phase I and to validate the advanced version with several hundred chest radiographs. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Today, there exists a need for an automated chest radiograph diagnostic system to screen the thousands of images collected daily at radiological service centers and hospitals worldwide and throughout the United States. A computer-based system that eliminates or reduces inter- and intra-reader variability significantly is required to improve the management and early diagnosis of the disease.

"Shearography for Non-Invasive Dental Health Evaluation   DESCRIPTION: Optical holography has been applied to non-invasive clinical            diagnosis and monitoring of Dental and oral/facial pathology, but has been           sharply limited in its usefulness by its requirements of high laser coherence.       absolute stability of setup. and wet processing of holograms. Physical Optics        Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a shearographic micro-optic camera as a        novel means of non-invasive Dental evaluation and characterization based on          shearing speckle interferometry, miniature camera imaging, and proprietary           neural network image processing. The innovation in this concept is the use of        shearography to avoid the need for high stability, high temporal coherence, and      wet processing. Nearfield shearography will have high spatial resolution, and        the neural network will perform real-time data processing and display.                                                                                                    The unique high resolution. real-time operation. low cost. and miniaturization       will make this device attractive to a large commercial market in Dental and          clinical applications.

It will be capable of distinguishing among tooth enamel, cementum,           dentine, pulp, and soft tissue.

"MAX-ENTROPY CONTROL FOR HIGH QUALITY DIGITAL IMAGING   A low-cost, high-resolution, high-contrast color digital camera optimized        for ophthalmology will be demonstrated. The maximum entropy camera         will be tested for its effectiveness in meeting the image quality requirements       for telemedicine and for remote screening of pre-proliferative and                   proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The proposed device exploits recent              technological advances in high sensitivity CCD cameras and digital signal            processing electronics. Today's low cost 8-bit CCD cameras do not have the           dynamic range to image the human retina, which is characterized by regions of        high reflectivity (20-40 percent), such as the optic disc, and very low              reflectivity (<2 percent), such as the macula and fovea.

"IMPROVING VIRTUAL COLONOSCOPY WITH COMPUTER DETECTION Colorectal carcinoma is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the         United States today.  In an effort to reduce mortality, Congress                 recently included a provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to              support screening colonoscopy as a means for early detection and removal         of colorectal polyps, the precursors to cancer.  In this country alone,          more than 68 million people are eligible for colorectal screening, but           the majority are unlikely to comply with screening recommendations               because of the costs, risks, discomfort, and inconvenience associated            with traditional endoscopy.  Furthermore, even if a small fraction of            eligible persons are examined, the number of available                           gastroenterologists would be insufficient to perform so many procedures.                                                                                          We have developed a new technique, called virtual colonoscopy (VC), as           an alternative to screening diagnostic colonoscopy (DC). The procedure           consists of cleansing a patient's colon, inflating the colon with air,           scanning the abdomen with helical computed tomography (CT), and                  generating a rapid sequence of three-dimensional (3D) images of the              colon by means of virtual reality computer technology.  Although VC              makes possible the visualization of 3D images of the colon in a manner           similar to that of DC, a correct diagnosis depends upon a physician's            ability to identify small and sometimes subtle polyps within hundreds            of 3D images.  The absence of visual cues that normally occur with DC            makes VC interpretation tedious and susceptible to error.                                                                                                         With support from a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant, we have             developed a computer-assisted polyp detection (CAPD) system that                 calculates areas of abnormal colon wall thickness in helical CT image            data in order to highlight potential polyps in the 3D images.  A                 physician ultimately determines if each detected lesion represents a             true abnormality.  Although we have found CAPD to be sensitive for               finding subtle abnormalities, poor specificity can be attributed to              several obstacles, including imprecise image segmentation, limited               feature analysis, and suboptimal bowel preparation prior to helical CT           scanning.  With these challenges in mind, we propose research to perfect         CAPD. Our specific aims are as follows: 1. To develop an image                   segmentation algorithm that accurately isolates the colon from helical           CT image data; 2. To improve our polyp detection algorithm with expanded         feature analysis and artificial intelligence methods; 3. To optimize             bowel preparation with digital subtraction of opacified feces and                controlled gas distention; and 4. To validate the accuracy of VC, with           the modifications achieved in the stated aims, by comparing the results          of VC and DC in 200 patients undergoing usual-care colonoscopy.                                                                                                   If VC with CAPD proves accurate and efficient in the diagnosis of                colorectal polyps, it could evolve into a simple laboratory test,                thereby meeting the demand for worldwide colorectal cancer screening.             n/a",IMPROVING VIRTUAL COLONOSCOPY WITH COMPUTER DETECTION,6376842,R01CA078485,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' colon neoplasms', ' colon polyp', ' computed axial tomography', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer simulation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' endoscopy', ' gastrointestinal imaging /visualization', ' human subject', ' image enhancement', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis']",NCI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY,R01,2001,607399,-0.01741453874776924
"RESEARCH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA-- RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY DESCRIPTION: (adapted from the applicant?s abstract): Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are common problems in the general population. The Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for TMD were developed to establish specific operationalized examination procedures and diagnostic criteria for 8 Axis I biomedical diagnoses of TMD, as well as Axis II biobehavioral assessment procedures. Procedural reliability testing has been established for the RDC Axis I examination items, but full acceptance of the RDC requires confirmation of the temporal stability, validity, generalizability and clinical utility of the examination items, biomedical diagnoses, biobehavioral assessments, and general protocol. In order to accomplish these overall goals, a multi-center project is proposed that will first reassess at the University of Minnesota the reliability of 6 examiners (2 examiners each from 3 participating universities) to collect clinical Axis I examination data using the RDC operational definitions. In a second step, reliable blinded examiners will collect clinical examination data and formulate RDC diagnoses, which will be compared to criterion diagnoses made by an expert imaging. New clinical exam items will also be assessed. Subject to expert consensus, they will be added to yield a final exam protocol that will include all current RDC examination items as well as the new items. With this new protocol, the 6 examiners will continue examining normal and TMD subjects at their respective centers in order to test the temporal stability and diagnostic validity of the new and existing examination items, patient history items, and TMJ imaging by plain film and MRI. Discriminant analyses and decision tree analyses will be used to determine the best diagnostic algorithms for rendering RDC diagnoses. Masticatory muscle biopsies and TMJ synovial fluid will be collected from subjects at the University of Minnesota to evaluate biological markers for their role as potential mediators underlying the biomedical diagnoses. Simultaneously, Axis II biobehavioral assessment procedures will be tested for temporal reliability, compared with other accepted self-report instruments for concurrent validity, and, at two centers, evaluated for criterion validity against highly structured psychiatric interviews. The clinical and health services utility of adding Axis II biobehavioral assessments, imaging and biopsy results to Axis I clinical examination findings will be appraised. Advancement in our understanding of the prevalence, etiologies, natural progression, and treatment of TMD is dependent on having reliable and valid diagnostic criteria for these disorders. n/a",RESEARCH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA-- RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY,6286594,U01DE013331,"['biomarker', ' biopsy', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', ' facial muscles', ' gas chromatography mass spectrometry', ' human subject', ' inflammation', ' interview', ' magnetic resonance imaging', ' mastication', ' musculoskeletal disorder diagnosis', ' oral facial pain', ' pain threshold', ' psychobiology', ' questionnaires', ' radioimmunoassay', ' sign /symptom', ' statistics /biometry', ' synovial fluid', ' temporomandibular joint syndrome', ' tissue /cell culture']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TWIN CITIES,U01,2001,1222618,0.017694830464870005

"METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF TAGGED MR CARDIAC IMAGES DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract):  The aim of this proposal       is to further develop and validate algorithms for analysis of SPAMM MR           cardiac images based on novel spline methods.  MRI is unique in its ability      to non-invasively and selectively alter tissue magnetization, and create         tagged patterns within the deforming tissue such as the heart muscle.  The       resulting pattern defines a time-varying curvilinear coordinate system on        the underlying tissue, allowing for precise and quantitative measurement of      tissue motion and deformation.  The investigators are developing two             frameworks for analysis of SPAMM tagged images, both of these aimed at           providing a more automated and reproducible approach to analysis of SPAMM        data, as well as providing dense 3-D displacement information at all points      within the LV myocardium.  The investigators propose to (a) further develop      and extend our analyses techniques.  The extensions considered will all be       related and based on currently developed computer vision-based techniques        for regional LV wall motion analysis, that operates either on a sequence of      SA slice stacks or on a time sequence of single slice.  (b) The                  investigators will validate the motion tracking methods by comparing ""true""      and algorithm-estimated motion trajectories:  1) on dense field of points        derived from 3-D tagged computer models of objects that simulate the moving      LV, 2) on dense field of points derived from Finite Element Model                simulations of the constitutive equations of LV deformations (once again tag     planes will be superimposed on the time course of simulated geometries), 3)      on selected points in the LV myocardium of the in vivo heart using a porcine     model.  Here, ""true"" motion will be determined by tracking implanted image       distinguishable markers.  (c) The investigators will test whether regions of     postmortem myocardial injury imply similar-sized and locate regions of           altered deformations (as measured by parameters developed in (a)).  The          algorithm-derived LV function assessment based on the analysis of in vivo        tagged MRI sequences will be compared with postmortem myocardial injury          assessment determined by myocardial staining techniques.  The validated          parameters will also be use to examine the time-course of change in the          ischemic areas of the chronic animal models.                                      n/a",METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF TAGGED MR CARDIAC IMAGES,6389619,R01HL057628,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cardiography', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer simulation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' heart motion', ' histopathology', ' human subject', ' image processing', ' magnetic resonance imaging', ' myocardial ischemia /hypoxia', ' swine']",NHLBI,BARNES-JEWISH HOSPITAL,R01,2001,122402,0.0025782407054251773
"ENERGY RESOLVED DIGITAL HPGE X OR Y-RAY IMAGING DETECTOR Imaging detectors for 10 to 150 keV photons have many uses in medical technology, including tumor imaging, SPECT, and radiography. Digital output is particularly useful since it allows image enhancement, analysis, transmission and storage. In Phase I we proposed a new technology that could capture images with 100 microm spatial resolution and 1 keV energy resolution or better. This capability would facilitate entirely new classes of medical diagnostic procedures, particularly for transgenic small animal imaging. Our Phase I work demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In this Phase II effort, collaborating with Paul Luke at LBNL, we will construct 1 cm thick crossed-strip HPGe detectors having 10 x 10 strips, each 2 mm x 20 mm. We will develop cooled FET preamplifiers having low noise and large bandwidth properties specifically required by this approach. We will also develop analog filtering electronics to condition the detector's novel signals and employ digital pulse processing electronics to acquire these signals at rates up to 10/6 cps. Finally, we will devise procedures to test the detector's linearity and develop processing algorithms to perfect this quality. Phase II will conclude with a working and tested prototype. Phase III will entail primarily production engineering efforts. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: As an energy resolved digital detector with 100 microm spatial resolution, the proposed detector technology could find many medical applications, including SPECT, energy resolved angiography for small mammals, bone densitometry on rodent bones, and small, hand-held gamma cameras.

"IMAGE PATTERN BASED WAVELET COMPRESSION FOR RADIOLOGY DESCRIPTION:  The research and development of teleradiology and telemedicine     systems has progressed through many technical and clinical endeavors.  When      dealing with large volume image transmission and storage, image data             compression is an outstanding issue in medical applications to which current     techniques were not designed to address.  The technical objectives of this       project are to develop optimized error-free as well as error-controllable        methods for medical image compression based on wavelet transform and             associated methods.  In this project, we employ both advanced artificial         intelligent and compression techniques to achieve these goals.                                                                                                    Our recent research outcomes include:  (a) development of a mathematics          approach to unify prediction, subband, and wavelet transforms, (b)               development of convolution neural network training methods to obtain             optimized wavelet kernel, (c) development of a data splitting technique to       improve edge accuracy and to provide error-control methods, and (d)              development of an integer implementation method for all wavelet transforms,      etc.  Based on the above technical advances, we propose to use integer form      of an adaptive (optimized) wavelets in conjunction with newly developed          coding methods such as ""partitioning in hierarchical trees"" (PHT) for            lossless compression.  For error-controllable approaches, we propose to use      adaptive wavelets coupled with optimized neural network prediction methods       in this study.  Since lossless compression is a part of the error -              controllable method, both systems can be implemented in the same scheme          which is a breakthrough approach in the field.  We will compare the              compression results (i.e., compression ratio and speed) of the proposed          compression methods with those of the current wavelet techniques using the       embedded zero-tree coding method.  At the end of the project, we will            deliver a software package for the radiological society.  Hence, the             evaluation for various clinical applications using the proposed methods can      be performed by the investigators.                                                                                                                                As the field of telemedicine is rapidly growing, we believe that development     of a dedicated compression module for economical storage and fast                communication of patient data (particularly for patient images) is               necessary.  This project is designed to address the related technical issues     with a strong clinical consideration.                                             n/a",IMAGE PATTERN BASED WAVELET COMPRESSION FOR RADIOLOGY,6173899,R01CA079139,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' charge coupled device camera', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' digital imaging', ' human data', ' image processing', ' radiology', ' telemedicine']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,176034,0.01707296320137784
"DEVELOPMENT OF A KNOWLEDGE-BASED IMAGE REPORTING SYSTEM We have constructed a prototype structured reporting system that replaces conventional dictation and transcription for medical image reporting. Key design features include reporting speed, generation of graphical reports, structured storage of imaging findings, and the use of existing lexicons. Pilot timing data suggest that a radiologist using our system can generate a report more rapidly than with conventional reporting methods or speech recognition systems. Support is sought to refine the prototype, and to conduct feasibility testing. The specific aims are (1) to augment and refine a hierarchical test lexicon of imaging terms (2) to develop methods for the representation and reporting of imaging findings and their logical relationships, (3) to evaluate the system's performance on clinical imaging reports, and (4) to assess the completeness of existing lexicons for imaging. The project is supported by a Technical Advisory Committee comprised of experts in key methodological areas. A successful Phase I will lead (in Phase II) to testing of the approach for cross-sectional imaging, to adoption, augmentation, and use of an existing lexicon, to construction of real-time decision support techniques based on the knowledge base of imaging findings generated by the system, and to system evaluation in a clinical setting. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Our structured reporting system is appealing to radiologists because it speeds up the reporting process compared to conventional dictation/transcription or speech recognition. In addition, the system eliminates the costs, delays, inaccuracies, and other organizational problems associated with transcription services, thereby improving patient care. Therefore, time-efficient, speech-augmented structured reporting systems will likely capture a significant segment of the $1.2 billion annual market for radiology transcription services.  n/a",DEVELOPMENT OF A KNOWLEDGE-BASED IMAGE REPORTING SYSTEM,6073984,R43LM006837,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' imaging /visualization /scanning', ' information systems', ' vocabulary', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,"EDICT SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2000,98563,-0.007546910791869346
"WAVELET ENHANCEMENT OF CHROMOSOME BANDING PATTERNS This project aims to develop and commercialize significantly improved software for digital enhancement of the detail of chromosome banding patterns in microscopic images. These investigators have developed an innovative technique for this application, based upon wavelet transforms and multiresolution image analysis. Used with modern computerized chromosome analysis the proposed technique promises significantly improved enhancement of chromosome banding patterns and more effective visual detection of subtle rearrangements. This will help clinicians and researchers detect previously invisible or sub-visible band pattern alterations in conventional and high resolution banding. It will significantly increase the ability of automated instruments to assist the evaluation of chromosome alterations in clinical samples and in normal and neoplastic mammalian cells. During Phase I we implemented and tested three wavelet transforms with desirable mathematical properties. We developed a prototype multiresolution image processing system for chromosome enhancement. We obtained extremely encouraging results, strongly suggesting that these techniques offer considerably improved enhancement capability over conventional methods. and clearly demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. In Phase II we will complete the implementation and refinement of the software. We will implement several wavelet design approaches and evaluate many wavelet transform basis function sets that potentially can bring out relevant detail in chromosome banding patterns.

COMPUTER AIDED CARDIAC MEASUREMENT The objective of the proposed research is to develop a method for providing fast and accurate measurements of volume and ejection fraction from 3D echo images. Our Computer Aided Measurement System will reconstruct the LV endocardium using a few user selected points on oriented echocardiographic images together with prior shape and size knowledge. The Specific Aims for Phase I are: 1. To improve the accuracy of quantitative echo while minimizing manual labor. 2. To improve the ease of use of the prototype system for application in a clinical setting. 3. To expand the catalog representing our knowledge base by acquiring additional large volume and abnormally shaped LV's in order to enhance fitting accuracy for atypical shapes. Previously described methods of analyzing echocardiograms in 3D require so much manual labor that this modality has been limited to research applications. The advantages of our proposed approach are that it makes the superior accuracy and reproducibility of 3D echo available for clinical practice. Furthermore this process will be applicable to other imaging modalities.

"KNOWLEDGE BASED SYSTEMS FOR DIAGNOSTIC HISTOPATHOLOGY DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract):  Knowledge-guided, fully        automated image analytic procedures will be applied, and further developed       for the extraction of diagnostic and prognostic information from                 histopathologic sections.  It is proposed to develop knowledge files for the     grading of solar lesions, for the analysis of prostatic intraepithelial          neoplastic lesions (PIN), for benign proliferative epithelial lesions of the     breast, and for kidney tumors.  Quantitative progression indices will be         derived from histometric measurements.  These may serve to identify patients     at high risk to develop infiltrating disease, to measure rate of lesion          progression, and to allow a numeric assessment of the efficacy of                chemopreventive intervention.

"IMPROVING VIRTUAL COLONOSCOPY WITH COMPUTER DETECTION Colorectal carcinoma is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the         United States today.  In an effort to reduce mortality, Congress                 recently included a provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to              support screening colonoscopy as a means for early detection and removal         of colorectal polyps, the precursors to cancer.  In this country alone,          more than 68 million people are eligible for colorectal screening, but           the majority are unlikely to comply with screening recommendations               because of the costs, risks, discomfort, and inconvenience associated            with traditional endoscopy.  Furthermore, even if a small fraction of            eligible persons are examined, the number of available                           gastroenterologists would be insufficient to perform so many procedures.                                                                                          We have developed a new technique, called virtual colonoscopy (VC), as           an alternative to screening diagnostic colonoscopy (DC). The procedure           consists of cleansing a patient's colon, inflating the colon with air,           scanning the abdomen with helical computed tomography (CT), and                  generating a rapid sequence of three-dimensional (3D) images of the              colon by means of virtual reality computer technology.  Although VC              makes possible the visualization of 3D images of the colon in a manner           similar to that of DC, a correct diagnosis depends upon a physician's            ability to identify small and sometimes subtle polyps within hundreds            of 3D images.  The absence of visual cues that normally occur with DC            makes VC interpretation tedious and susceptible to error.                                                                                                         With support from a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant, we have             developed a computer-assisted polyp detection (CAPD) system that                 calculates areas of abnormal colon wall thickness in helical CT image            data in order to highlight potential polyps in the 3D images.  A                 physician ultimately determines if each detected lesion represents a             true abnormality.  Although we have found CAPD to be sensitive for               finding subtle abnormalities, poor specificity can be attributed to              several obstacles, including imprecise image segmentation, limited               feature analysis, and suboptimal bowel preparation prior to helical CT           scanning.  With these challenges in mind, we propose research to perfect         CAPD. Our specific aims are as follows: 1. To develop an image                   segmentation algorithm that accurately isolates the colon from helical           CT image data; 2. To improve our polyp detection algorithm with expanded         feature analysis and artificial intelligence methods; 3. To optimize             bowel preparation with digital subtraction of opacified feces and                controlled gas distention; and 4. To validate the accuracy of VC, with           the modifications achieved in the stated aims, by comparing the results          of VC and DC in 200 patients undergoing usual-care colonoscopy.                                                                                                   If VC with CAPD proves accurate and efficient in the diagnosis of                colorectal polyps, it could evolve into a simple laboratory test,                thereby meeting the demand for worldwide colorectal cancer screening.             n/a",IMPROVING VIRTUAL COLONOSCOPY WITH COMPUTER DETECTION,6173999,R01CA078485,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' colon neoplasms', ' colon polyp', ' computed axial tomography', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer simulation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' endoscopy', ' gastrointestinal imaging /visualization', ' human subject', ' image enhancement', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis']",NCI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,563099,-0.01741453874776924
"METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF TAGGED MR CARDIAC IMAGES DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract):  The aim of this proposal       is to further develop and validate algorithms for analysis of SPAMM MR           cardiac images based on novel spline methods.  MRI is unique in its ability      to non-invasively and selectively alter tissue magnetization, and create         tagged patterns within the deforming tissue such as the heart muscle.  The       resulting pattern defines a time-varying curvilinear coordinate system on        the underlying tissue, allowing for precise and quantitative measurement of      tissue motion and deformation.  The investigators are developing two             frameworks for analysis of SPAMM tagged images, both of these aimed at           providing a more automated and reproducible approach to analysis of SPAMM        data, as well as providing dense 3-D displacement information at all points      within the LV myocardium.  The investigators propose to (a) further develop      and extend our analyses techniques.  The extensions considered will all be       related and based on currently developed computer vision-based techniques        for regional LV wall motion analysis, that operates either on a sequence of      SA slice stacks or on a time sequence of single slice.  (b) The                  investigators will validate the motion tracking methods by comparing ""true""      and algorithm-estimated motion trajectories:  1) on dense field of points        derived from 3-D tagged computer models of objects that simulate the moving      LV, 2) on dense field of points derived from Finite Element Model                simulations of the constitutive equations of LV deformations (once again tag     planes will be superimposed on the time course of simulated geometries), 3)      on selected points in the LV myocardium of the in vivo heart using a porcine     model.  Here, ""true"" motion will be determined by tracking implanted image       distinguishable markers.  (c) The investigators will test whether regions of     postmortem myocardial injury imply similar-sized and locate regions of           altered deformations (as measured by parameters developed in (a)).  The          algorithm-derived LV function assessment based on the analysis of in vivo        tagged MRI sequences will be compared with postmortem myocardial injury          assessment determined by myocardial staining techniques.  The validated          parameters will also be use to examine the time-course of change in the          ischemic areas of the chronic animal models.                                      n/a",METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF TAGGED MR CARDIAC IMAGES,6184044,R01HL057628,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cardiography', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer simulation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' heart motion', ' histopathology', ' human subject', ' image processing', ' magnetic resonance imaging', ' myocardial ischemia /hypoxia', ' swine']",NHLBI,BARNES-JEWISH HOSPITAL,R01,2000,119129,0.0025782407054251773
"TOPIC #411 - PHASE I SBIR CONTRACT - DE-IDENTIFICATION SOFTWARE TOOLS FOR CANCER IMAGING RESEARCH Developing artificial intelligence technology for medical imaging applications requires training models on large and diverse datasets.  Currently, aggregation of large data repositories, including radiology and pathology images, is limited by concerns around patient privacy.  In order to successfully share medical images, an institution must be able to quickly and accurately de-identify large numbers of images in batches.  This process is currently manual and time-consuming. We propose a pipeline to remove PHI from both radiology DICOM images and pathology whole slide images by leveraging machine learning, natural language processing, and compartmentalized workflow techniques to significantly reduce the human intervention needed to anonymize medical images.  In addition to examining header data in the images, we will use optical character recognition and computer vision algorithms to detect text in any location or orientation in the image, then automatically record and subsequently purge these regions. These techniques will be configured to work on a variety of image types (CT, MRI, radiograph, etc) and cover multiple OEM vendors for both radiology and pathology images. This phase I statement of work will construct the software tools, methods, and datasets necessary to facilitate a phase II where the complex algorithms needed for autonomous deidentification will be developed.

"Integrative Predictors of Temporomandibular Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This application proposes the development of efficient web-based data management, mining, and analytics, to integrate and analyze clinical, biological, and high dimensional imaging data from TMJ OA patients. Based on our published results, we hypothesize that patterns of condylar bone structure, clinical symptoms, and biological mediators are unrecognized indicators of the severity of progression of TMJ OA. Efficiently capturing, curating, managing, integrating and analyzing this data in a manner that maximizes its value and accessibility is critical for the scientific advances and benefits that such comprehensive TMJ OA patient information may enable. High dimensional databases are increasingly difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional processing applications, creating a continuing demand for innovative approaches. Toward this end, the DCBIA at the Univ. of Michigan has partnered with the University of North Carolina, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Kitware Inc. Through high-dimensional quantitative characterization of individuals with TMJ OA, at molecular, clinical and imaging levels, we will identify phenotypes at risk for more severe prognosis, as well as targets for future therapies. The proposed web-based system, the Data Storage for Computation and Integration (DSCI), will remotely compute machine learning, image analysis, and advanced statistics from prospectively collected longitudinal data on patients with TMJ OA. Due to its ubiquitous design in the web, DSCI software installation will no longer be required. Our long-term goal is to create software and data repository for Osteoarthritis of the TMJ. Such repository requires maintaining the data in a distributed computational environment to allow contributions to the database from multi-clinical centers and to share trained models for TMJ classification. In years 4 and 5 of the proposed work, the dissemination and training of clinicians at the Schools of Dentistry at the University of North Carol, Univ. of Minnesota and Oregon Health Sciences will allow expansion of the proposed studies.

"Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study PROJECT SUMMARY Road traffic injuries are a major contributor to the burden of disease globally with nearly 1.3 million deaths globally and as many as 50 million injured annually with pedestrians and cyclists in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) among the most affected. Road infrastructure of the built environment (e.g., sidewalks), neighborhood design (e.g., street connectivity) and urban development (e.g., urban sprawl) are key determinants of the risk of pedestrian injuries. In LMICs, poor road infrastructure and neighborhood design are acknowledged as being important contributors to rising numbers of road traffic injuries and deaths, but there are few studies systematically identifying and quantifying what specific features of the built environment are contributing to motor vehicle collisions in these settings. Within LMIC cities, there are often large disparities where infrastructure is improved that reflect socioeconomic characteristics, leading to health inequities in road traffic injury. The paucity of georeferenced data on the built environment in LMICs has made research on road traffic injuries more difficult, though recent advances in computer vision and image analysis combined with Big Data of publicly available, georeferenced, images of roads worldwide (e.g., Google Street View, GSV) can help overcome the paucity of data and the cost and time limitations of collecting and analyzing data on the built environment in LMICs. Automated image analysis has largely been made possible via deep learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning and relies on training neural networks to detect and label specific objects within images. These methods can drastically reduce the barriers to citywide built environment and traffic safety research in LMIC cities, thus substantially increasing research capacity and generalizability. My career goal is to become an independent investigator in global urban health with a focus on road safety and the built environment in LMICs. I propose undertaking research and training in deep learning methods applied to public health in the setting of Bogota, Colombia: 1) Develop neural networks to create a database of BE features of the road infrastructure from image data and to create neighborhood typologies from those features; 2) Assess the association between neighborhood-level BE features and typologies and pedestrian collisions and fatalities and road safety perceptions; 3) Assess the association of neighborhood social environment characteristics with pedestrian collision and fatalities, perceptions, and BE features and typologies. I am seeking additional training in 1) developing competency in deep learning methods applied to public health; 2) creating neighborhood indictors and typologies of health and the built environment; 3) applying Bayesian spatiotemporal models to understand how neighborhood characteristics and typologies influence health; 4) develop skills in multi-country collaboration, grant writing and overseeing research projects in LMICs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Roads and neighborhoods with a built environment that support safe and active transportation are a major priority in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to 90% of road traffic deaths occurring in these locations, especially to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, yet data on key built environment features at a large scale are not always readily available in these settings. My career goal is to improve population health by examining the effects of the built environment and transportation on health through the adoption and use of methods that can leverage Big Data sources and answer complex, multilevel research questions by overcoming the lack of built environment data in LMICs. The proposed research uses deep learning and advanced statistical methods to create a citywide dataset of built and social environment features in Bogota, Colombia that will provide crucial data to answer questions of their impact on pedestrian injuries and deaths, as well as assessing the presence of health inequities in their distribution and that will lay the groundwork to expand these efforts to more cities in Latin America and other LMICs.","Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study",10123391,K01TW011782,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Colombia', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Education', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Label', 'Latin America', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Social Environment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Typology', 'Urban Developments', 'Urban Health', 'Vehicle crash', 'Writing', 'automated image analysis', 'built environment', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data infrastructure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'neighborhood association', 'neural network', 'pedestrian injury', 'population health', 'skills', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'spatiotemporal', 'virtual']",FIC,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,138024,0.0056109569877133055

"Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is a leading reversible cause of death after blunt trauma. Prediction of arterial bleeding risk is difficult, and currently determined using subjective criteria, often based on qualitative results of admission computed tomography (CT). Segmented hematoma and contrast extravasation (CE) volumes predict need for angioembolization, major transfusion, and mortality but cannot be applied in real-time. The ill-defined multi-focal nature of pelvic hematomas and CE prevents reliable estimation using diameter-based measurements. Dr. Dreizin is a trauma radiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. His early work has focused on improving the speed and reliability of volumetric analysis of pelvic hematomas using semi-automated techniques, and derivation of a logistic regression-based prediction tool for major arterial injury after pelvic fractures. Dr. Dreizin’s goal for this four- year K08 mentored career development award proposal is to gain the skills needed to 1) implement deep learning architectures for automated hematoma volume segmentation and 2) develop computational models for outcome prediction after pelvic trauma. These tools could greatly improve the speed and accuracy of clinical decision making in the setting of life-threatening traumatic pelvic bleeding. Fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have emerged as the most robust and scalable method for automated medical image segmentation. Intuitive software platforms for training FCN implementations and generating multivariable machine learning models have been developed in the Python programming environment. The training objectives and research activities of this proposal are necessary to provide Dr. Dreizin with new skills and practical experience in Python programming, deep learning software, and computational modeling software. By understanding the principles and computational infrastructure behind modern machine learning, Dr. Dreizin will be able to train and validate state-of-the-art algorithms independently and effectively lead a team of researchers in this area. To achieve his goals, Dr. Dreizin has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors, advisors, and collaborators with world-leading expertise in computer vision in medical imaging, probability theory, data science, and comparative effectiveness research. Dr. Dreizin will focus on two specific aims. In Aim 1, he will train and validate deep learning architectures for segmentation of traumatic pelvic hematomas and CE by computing the Dice metric, time effort, and correlation with clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, he will generate and test quantitative models for predicting major arterial bleeding after pelvic trauma based on a rich multi-label dataset of segmented features. The training and pilot data will be necessary for Dr. Dreizin’s long- term goal of research independence and R01 support to develop automated segmentation algorithms for the spectrum of clinically important imaging features after pelvic trauma, as well as fully automated multivariable clinical prediction tools with potential for translation to industry and as an FDA-cleared product. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is common after motor vehicle collisions, falls, and crush injuries, with mortality rates that range from 5-54%. The volume of hemorrhage, as measured on computed tomography (CT) scans, predicts the need for rapid intervention or transfusion, and is a strong predictor of mortality, but no automated image-processing methods exist for real-time hemorrhage volume measurement. We propose to develop automated software for hemorrhage-detection, and real-time risk prediction software for major arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures.",Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures,9955253,K08EB027141,"['Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arterial Injury', 'Award', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Caliber', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Crush Injury', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Extravasation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hematoma', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maryland', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Predictive Value', 'Probability Theory', 'Process', 'Programming Languages', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shorthand', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Vehicle crash', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'artificial neural network', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer infrastructure', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'fall injury', 'hemodynamics', 'heuristics', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'muscle form', 'neural network architecture', 'outcome prediction', 'pelvis fracture', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'radiologist', 'random forest', 'real time model', 'secondary outcome', 'segmentation algorithm', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'support vector machine', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K08,2020,186183,0.011733348938578206
"Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Abstract The microscopic examination of stained tissue is a fundamental component of biomedical research and for the understanding of biological processes of disease which leads to improved diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response prediction. Ranging from cancer diagnosis to heart rejection and forensics the subjective interpretation of histopathology sections forms the basis of clinical decision making and research outcomes. However, it has been shown that such subjective interpretation of pathology slides suffers from large interobserver and intraobserver variability. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning has enabled the objective and automated analysis of images. These methods have been applied with success to histology images which have demonstrated potential for development of objective image interpretation paradigms. However, significant algorithmic challenges remain to be addressed before such objective analysis of histology images can be used by clinicians and researchers. Leveraging extensive experience in developing and decimating research software based on deep learning the PI will pioneer novel algorithmic approaches to address these challenges including but not limited to: (1) training data-efficient and interpretable deep learning models with gigapixel size microscopy images for classification and segmentation using weakly supervised labels (2) fundamental redesign of data fusion paradigms for integrating information from microscopy images and molecular profiles (from multi-omics data) for improved diagnostic and prognostic determinations (3) developing visualization and interpretation software for researchers and clinical workflows to improve clinical and research validation and reproducability. The system will be designed in a modular, user-friendly manner and will be open-source, available through GitHub as universal plug-and-play modules ready to be adapted to various clinical and research applications. We will also develop a web resource with pretrained models for various organs, disease states and subtypes these will be accompanied with detailed manuals so researchers can apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Overall, the laboratory’s research will yield high impact discoveries from pathology image analysis, and its software will enable many other NIH funded laboratories to do the same, across various biomedical disciplines. Project Narrative The microscopic examination of stained tissue is a fundamental component of biomedical research, disease diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response prediction.

"Can machines be trusted? Robustification of deep learning for medical imaging Machine learning algorithms have become increasing popular in medical imaging, where highly functional algorithms have been trained to recognize patterns or features within image data sets and perform clinically relevant tasks such as tumor segmentation and disease diagnosis. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning, by leveraging massive datasets and immense computing power to extract features from data. Deep learning is ideally suited for problems in medical imaging, and has enjoyed success in diverse tasks such as segmenting cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues. However, research in machine learning has also shown that deep learning is fragile in the sense that carefully designed perturbations to an image can cause the algorithm to fail. These perturbations can be designed to be imperceptible by humans, so that a trained radiologist would not make the same mistakes. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation, it is therefore crucial to develop a better understanding of the performance of neural networks. Specifically, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data. The goal of this project is to explore these questions in the context of medical imaging—to better identify strengths, weaknesses, and failure points of deep learning algorithms. We posit that malicious perturbations, of the type studied in theoretical machine learning, may not be representative of the sort of noise encountered in medical images. Although noise is inevitable in a physical system, the noise arising from sources such as subject motion, operator error, or instrument malfunction may have less deleterious effects on a deep learning algorithm. We propose to characterize the effect of these perturbations on the performance of deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, we will study the effect of random labeling error introduced into the data set, as might arise due to honest human error. We will also develop new methods for making deep learning algorithms more robust to the types of clinically relevant perturbations described above. In summary, although the susceptibility of neural networks to small errors in the inputs is widely recognized in the deep learning community, our work will investigate these general phenomena in the specific case of medical imaging tasks, and also conduct the first study of average-case errors that could realistically arise in clinical studies. Furthermore, we will produce novel recommendations for how to quantify and improve the resiliency of deep learning approaches in medical imaging. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning by achieving superhuman performance on many tasks. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation in assisting radiologists for tasks such as segmentation of cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data.

"A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney Project Summary  Despite the widespread prevalence of ultrasound imaging in hospitals today, the clinical utility of ultrasound guidance is severely hampered by clutter and reverberation artifacts that obscure structures of interest and com- plicate anatomical measurements. Clutter is particularly problematic in overweight and obese individuals, who account for 78.6 million adults and 12.8 million children in North America. Similarly, interventional procedures of- ten require insertion of one or more metal tools, which generate reverberation artifacts that obfuscate instrument location, orientation, and geometry, while obscuring nearby tissues, thus additionally hampering ultrasound im- age quality. Although artifacts are problematic, ultrasound continues to persist primarily because of its greatest strengths (i.e., mobility, cost, non-ionizing radiation, real-time visualization, and multiplanar views) in comparison to existing image-guidance options, but it would be signiﬁcantly more useful without problematic artifacts.  Our long-term project goal is to use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to provide interventional radiologists with artifact-free ultrasound-based images. We will initially develop a new framework alternative to the ultrasound beamforming process that removes needle tip reverberations and acoustic clutter caused by multipath scattering in near-ﬁeld tissues when guiding needles to the kidney to enable removal of painful kidney stones. Our ﬁrst aim will test convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that input raw channel data and output human readable images with no artifacts caused by multipath scattering and reverberations. A secondary goal of the CNNs is to learn the minimum number of parameters required to create these new CNN-based images. Our second aim will validate the trained algorithms with ultrasound data from experimental phantom and ex vivo tissue. Our third aim will extend our evaluation to ultrasound images of in vivo porcine kidneys. This work is the ﬁrst to propose bypassing the entire beamforming process and replacing it with machine learning and computer vision techniques to remove traditionally problematic noise artifacts and create a fundamentally new type of artifact-free, high-contrast, high-resolution, ultrasound-based image for guiding interventional procedures.  This work combines the expertise of an imaging scientist, a computer scientist, and an interventional ra- diologist to explore an untapped, understudied area that is only recently made feasible through improvements in computing power, advances in computer vision capabilities, and new knowledge about dominant sources of image degradation. Translation to in vivo cases is enabled by our clinical collaboration with the Department of Radiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to develop these tools and capabilities to eliminate noise artifacts in interventional ultrasound, opening the door to a new paradigm in ultrasound image formation, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients with clearer, easier-to-interpret ultrasound images. Subsequent R01 funding will customize our innovation to addi- tional application-speciﬁc ultrasound procedures (e.g., breast biopsies, cancer detection, autonomous surgery). Project Narrative Artifacts in ultrasound images, speciﬁcally artifacts caused by multipath scattering and acoustic reverberations (which occur when imaging through the abdominal tissue of overweight and obese patients or visualizing metallic surgical tools), remain as a major clinical challenge. There are no existing solutions to eliminate these artifacts based on today's signal processing techniques. The goal of this project is to step away from conventional signal processing models and instead learn from raw data examples with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that differentiate artifacts from true signals, and thereby deliver clearer, easier-to-interpret images.",A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney,9913520,R21EB025621,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Biopsy', 'Breast biopsy', 'Bypass', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Fatty Liver', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interventional Ultrasonography', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver diseases', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Needles', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'North America', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Readability', 'Resolution', 'Retroperitoneal Space', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surgical Instruments', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fetal', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'imaging scientist', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'signal processing', 'tool']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,235027,0.0011218153430150068
"Improving cardiovascular image-based phenotyping using emerging methods in artificial intelligence Summary / Abstract Objective — The goal of this proposal is to develop and optimize novel deep learning (DL) assisted approaches to improve diagnosis and clinical decision-making for congenital heart disease (CHD). This will be achieved by using DL, machine learning (ML), and related methods to extract diagnosis, biometric characterizations, and other information from fetal ultrasound imaging. Notably, this work includes a clinical translational evaluation of these methods in a population-wide imaging collection spanning two decades, tens of thousands of patients, and several clinical centers. Background — Despite clear and numerous benefits to prenatal detection of CHD and an ability for fetal ultrasound to detect over 90% of CHD lesions in theory, in practice the fetal CHD detection rate is closer to 50%. Prior literature suggests a key cause of this startling diagnosis gap is suboptimal acquisition and interpretation of fetal heart images. DL is a novel data science technique that is proving excellent at pattern recognition in images. DL models are a function of the design and tuning of a neural network architecture, and the curation and processing of the image data used to train the network. Preliminary Studies — We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of experts in echocardiography and CHD (Drs. Grady, Levine, and Arnaout), DL and data science (Drs. Keiser, Butte and Arnaout), and statistics and clinical research (Drs. Arnaout and Grady) and secured access to tens of thousands of multicenter (UCSF and six other centers), multimodal fetal imaging studies. We have created a scalable image processing pipeline to transform clinical studies into image data ready for computing. We have designed and trained DL models to find key cardiac views in fetal ultrasound, calculate standard and advanced fetal cardiac biometrics from those views, and distinguish between normal hearts and certain CHD lesions. Hypothesis — While DL is powerful, much work is still needed to adapt it for clinical imaging and to translate it toward clinically relevant performance in patient populations. We hypothesize that an integrated ensemble DL/ML approach can lead to vast improvements in fetal CHD diagnosis. Aims — To this end, the main Aims of this proposal are (1) to develop and optimize neural network architectures and efficient data inputs to relieve key performance bottlenecks for DL in fetal CHD; and (2) to deploy DL models population-wide to evaluate their ability to improve diagnosis, biometric characterization, and precision phenotyping over the current standard of care. Our methods include DL/ML algorithms and retrospective imaging analysis. Environment and Impact — This work will be supported in an outstanding environment for research at the crossroads of data science, cardiovascular and fetal imaging, and translational informatics. The work proposed will provide valuable tools and insight into designing and evaluating both the data and the algorithms for DL on imaging for clinically relevant goals, and will lay important groundwork for DL-assisted phenotyping for both clinical use and precision medicine research. Project Narrative Medical imaging is critical to almost every type of diagnostic and management decision, but human interpretation of medical images can lack accuracy and reproducibility. By developing machine learning methods for analyzing medical images, the work in our proposal can improve diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging, for both clinical and research uses.",Improving cardiovascular image-based phenotyping using emerging methods in artificial intelligence,9867431,R01HL150394,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Apical', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Echocardiography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Heart', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Secure', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'computerized data processing', 'congenital heart disorder', 'cost', 'data curation', 'data harmonization', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease diagnosis', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'heart imaging', 'image guided', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning network', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'model design', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repaired', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,806128,0.018841303741227333
"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress. We will then to apply this in a prospective, adaptive validation trial against oxygen-15 water PET CBF, using simultaneous PET/MRI to minimize biological variability. Finally, we will apply this improv- ed tool to study the effects of gender on CVR and its reproducibility. Successful completion of this study will result in a validated methodology to assess CVR in cerebrovascular disease patients without the use of radiation or contrast. As such, it will provide solid, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians developing new paradigms and interventions in patients with impaired CVR.

"Advancing Ulcerative Colitis Monitoring with Deep Learning Models Project Summary/Abstract The number of practicing pathologists around the world is expected to decrease by as much as 30% over the next two decades, with some of the world’s poorest countries having a ratio of only one pathologist to many hundreds of thousands of people. At the same time, the diagnostic caseload that requires their expertise in clinical trials and hospital settings will continue to grow. The digitization of pathology data, coupled with the use of machine learning techniques for analyzing and scoring the data, provides exciting opportunities to make the field of pathology more efficient and scalable, even as the workforce continues to evolve. Deep learning in particular provides the potential to enhance the interpretation of medical images by improving the detection of image-based biomarkers for a broad range of diseases. Image interpretation plays an important role in patient eligibility and endpoint determination during the course of clinical trials. For patients with ulcerative colitis, the development of trained and reliable algorithms that can help pathologists identify disease progression and response to treatment in a timely and effective manner can provide benefit in two important ways. First, it will help to ensure that the most appropriate score for histological disease severity is being assigned to each image using the Robarts Histopathology Index (RHI) or similar grading scale. Second, it will support a triage process by which images known to contain non- healthy tissues can be prioritized for earlier assessment. Through a unique partnership between Azavea, a geospatial technology and machine learning firm, and Robarts, a clinical trials organization, the proposed research will begin to address these needs by developing deep learning algorithms for histopathology digital image analysis, testing them on machine-readable annotations of medical imagery from previous clinical studies, and exposing them through a metadata- searchable interface that will enable the images to be categorized and quickly accessed by pathologists and others to support reader training and increase communication between multiple readers and sites. In so doing, it will not only help streamline the evaluation of new ulcerative colitis treatments that rely heavily on the image interpretation process, but also provide the foundation for the identification of additional components present in other gastrointestinal disease indications in the future. Project Narrative The proposed research will contribute critical new insights on the reliability, sensitivity, and practicality of machine learning to support gastrointestinal disease detection and evaluation in a clinical trials setting. In pathology, where manual interpretation of images using a microscope has remained relatively unchanged for decades, machine learning provides particular potential to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnoses by reducing the subjectivity that is often inherent in the process.",Advancing Ulcerative Colitis Monitoring with Deep Learning Models,10081185,R43EB030441,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Endoscopy', 'Endpoint Determination', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning Skill', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Software Design', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Validation', 'base', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'gastrointestinal', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging detection', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'learning network', 'prototype', 'software development', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIBIB,"AZAVEA, INC",R43,2020,150000,0.028355498427626545
"Artificial Intelligence for Assessment of Stargardt Macular Atrophy Project Abstract Stargardt disease is the most frequent form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) is a widely available imaging technique which may aid in the diagnosis of Stargardt disease and is commonly used to monitor its progression. FAF imaging provides an in vivo assay of the retinal layers, but is only an indirect measure. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), in contrast, provides three-dimensional visualization of the retinal microstructure, thereby allowing it to be assessed directly and individually in eyes with Stargardt disease. At a retinal disease endpoints meeting with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November of 2016, a reliable measure of the anatomic status of the integrity of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) in the retina, was proposed to be a potential suitable regulatory endpoint for therapeutic intervention clinical trials. Manual segmentation/identification of the EZ band, particularly in 3-D OCT images, has proven to be extremely tedious, time-consuming, and expensive. Automated objective segmentation techniques, such as an approach using a deep learning - artificial intelligence (AI) construct, would be of significant value. Moreover, Stargardt disease may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials. Thus, this proposal develops an AI-based approach for automated Stargardt atrophy segmentation and the prediction of atrophy progression in FAF and OCT images. More specifically, we first register the longitudinal FAF and OCT enface images respectively, and register the cross-sectional FAF to OCT image. We then develop a 2-D approach for Stargardt atrophy segmentation from FAF images using an AI approach and a 3-D approach for EZ band segmentation from OCT images using a 3-D graph-based approach. Finally, an AI-based approach is developed to predict subsequent development of new Stargardt atrophy or progression of existing atrophy from the OCT EZ band thickness and intensity features of the current patient visit. Project Narrative Stargardt disease is an inherited juvenile-onset macular dystrophy that may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults, thereby causing enormous morbidity with economic, psychological, emotional, and social implications. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials.

"Low- and Zero-dose Contrast-enhanced MRI Using Deep Learning Project Summary Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are used in approximately a third of all MRI scans. The unique relaxation parameters of GBCAs create indispensable image contrast for a wide range of clinical applications, such as angiography and tumor detection. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF can be painful, cause severe disability, and even death. The risk of developing NSF prevents millions of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams. The recent identification of gadolinium deposition within the brain and body has raised additional safety concerns about the usage of GBCAs. Studies have demonstrated increased signal intensity on the unenhanced T1-weighted MR images that is correlated with previous GBCA exposure, and this gadolinium retention is independent of renal function. While initial reports focused on linear GBCAs, more recent reports show that gadolinium deposition occurs with macrocyclic GBCAs as well, albeit at lower levels. FDA has recently issued warnings about gadolinium retention following contrast-enhanced MRI, and required GBCA manufacturers to conduct human and animal studies to further assess the safety of these contrast agents. This project addresses these concerns by developing low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI using artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL). Approach: This fast-track project has two phases and three aims. Aim 1 (Phase I) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using pre-contrast images and contrast-enhanced images acquired with only 10% of standard GBCA dose. A software infrastructure will be constructed to seamlessly integrate the DL software between MR scanners and PACS. Aim 2 (Phase II) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using GBCA-free acquisitions with different image contrast. In Aim 3 (Phase II), we will clinically validate and evaluate both low-dose and zero-dose DL methods, including on patients with mild- to-moderate CKD. Non-inferiority tests and diagnostic performance of the synthesized full-dose images compared to the true full-dose images will be performed. Significance: This work will lead to safer contrast-enhanced MRI. The low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI method will benefit not only millions of patients with advanced CKD, who cannot currently undergo contrast-enhanced MRI, but many more patients with normal kidney function, who are at the risk of gadolinium retention after contrast-enhanced MRI. Project Narrative Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in MRI exams to create indispensable image contrast for monitoring treatment and investigating pathology and function. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, preventing patients with advanced chronic kidney disease from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams, as well as potential gadolinium deposition in the body and brain for patients with normal kidney function.

"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,9997914,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Step training', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'patient population', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,498014,0.04527851426141638

"Improving Melanoma Pathology Accuracy through Computer Vision Techniques - the IMPACT Study ABSTRACT  This proposal will help to improve the accuracy of diagnosing melanoma and melanocytic lesions. The incidence of melanoma is rising faster than any other cancer, and ~1 in 50 U.S. adults will be diagnosed with melanoma this year alone. Our research team has noted substantial diagnostic errors in interpreting skin biopsies of melanocytic lesions; pathologists disagree in up to 60% of cases of invasive melanoma, which can lead to substantial patient harm. Our proposal uses computer technology to analyze whole-slide digital images of glass slides in order to improve the diagnosis of melanocytic lesions. Using data from an ongoing NIH study, we will digitize and study a set of 240 skin biopsy cases that includes a full spectrum of benign to invasive melanoma diagnoses. Each biopsy case has a reference consensus diagnosis developed by a panel of three international experts in dermatopathology and new data will be available from 160 practicing U.S. community pathologists, providing a uniquely rich clinical database that is the largest of its kind. This project will include novel computational techniques, including the detection of both cellular-level and architectural entities, and the use of a combination of feature-based and deep neural network classifiers. Our specific aims are: 1. To detect cellular-level entities in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions. 2. To detect structural (architectural) entities in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions. 3. To develop an automated diagnosis system that can classify digitized slide images into one of five possible diagnostic classes: benign; atypical lesions; melanoma in situ; invasive melanoma stage T1a; and invasive melanoma stage ≥T1b. In our proposed study, we are innovatively using computer image analysis algorithms and machine learning. This technology has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of pathologists by providing an analytical, undeviating review to assist humans in this difficult task. Project Narrative Diagnosis of melanoma and melanocytic skin biopsy lesions is among the most challenging areas of pathology and our preliminary data shows concerning levels of errors among pathologists. Our ultimate goal is to use innovative computer image analysis and machine learning techniques to reduce diagnostic errors and save patients' lives. The first step towards this goal is a correct diagnosis of melanoma.",Improving Melanoma Pathology Accuracy through Computer Vision Techniques - the IMPACT Study,9976466,R01CA200690,"['Adult', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Caring', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Dermatopathology', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mitotic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Precancerous melanosis', 'Process', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Skin', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinical database', 'deep neural network', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'feature detection', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maltreatment', 'melanocyte', 'melanoma', 'neural network classifier', 'novel', 'skin lesion', 'stem', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,385010,-0.0012755469640195576
"Deep-learning-based prediction of AMD and its progression with GWAS and fundus image data Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Successful genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AMD have identified many disease-susceptibility genes. Through great efforts from international GWAS consortium and large-scale collaborative projects, massive datasets including high-quality GWAS data and well-characterized clinical phenotypes are now available in public repositories such as dbGaP and UK Biobank. Clinically, color fundus images have been extensively used by ophthalmologists to diagnose AMD and its severity level. The combination of wealthy GWAS data and fundus image data provides an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to test new hypotheses that are beyond the objectives of original projects. Among them, predictive models for AMD development and its progression based on both GWAS and fundus image data have not been explored. Most existing prediction models only focus on classic statistical approaches, often regression models with a limited number of predictors (e.g., SNPs). Moreover, most predictions only give static risks rather than dynamic risk trajectories over time, of which the latter is more informative for a progressive disease like AMD. Recent advances of machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, have been proven to significantly improve prediction accuracy by incorporating multiple layers of hidden non-linear effects when large-scale training datasets with well-defined phenotypes are available. Despite its success in many areas, deep learning has not been fully explored in AMD and other eye diseases. Motivated by multiple large-scale studies of AMD development or progression, where GWAS and/or longitudinal fundus image data have been collected, we propose novel deep learning methods for predicting AMD status and its progression, and to identify subgroups with significant different risk profiles. Specially, in Aim 1, we will construct a novel local convolutional neural network to predict disease occurrence (AMD or not) and severity (e.g., mild AMD, intermediate AMD, late AMD) based on (1a): a large cohort of 35,000+ individuals with GWAS data and (1b): a smaller cohort of 4,000+ individuals with both GWAS and fundus image data. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel deep neural network survival model for predicting individual disease progression trajectory (e.g., time to late-AMD). In both aims, we will use the local linear approximation technique to identify important predictors that contribute to individual risk profile prediction and to identify subgroups with different risk profiles. In Aim 3, we will validate and calibrate our methods using independent cohorts and implement proposed methods into user-friendly software and easy-to-access web interface. With the very recent FDA approval for Beovu, a novel injection treatment for wet AMD (one type of late AMD) by inhibiting VEGF and thus suppressing the growth of abnormal blood vessels, it makes our study more significant, as it will provide most cutting-edge and comprehensive prediction models for AMD which have great potential to facilitate early diagnosis and tailored treatment and clinical management of the disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this proposal is to develop new analytic methods and software tools to facilitate novel prediction of AMD development and its progression. The successful completion of the project will generate the first comprehensive set of deep-learning-based prediction models and web-based interfaces, which jointly analyzes large-scale GWAS and fundus image data and has the great potential to enhance the early diagnosis and current clinical management of AMD.

"Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this project is to determine whether optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) might lead more accurate and objective diagnosis, earlier intervention, and improved outcomes in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). International consensus and National Institute of Health (NIH) funded clinical trials over the last 30 years have defined the phenotypic classifications, natural history, prognosis, and management of ROP. However, it is well established that due to the subjectivity of the ophthalmoscopic examination, and systematic bias between examiners, there is significant variation in treatment of the most severe forms of ROP in the real world. This leads to both under-treatment (and poor outcomes due to retinal detachment) and over-treatment (exposing neonates to the ocular and systemic risks of treatment). Roughly 20,000 babies per year develop retinal detachments (RD) due to ROP and there is strong evidence that most of these are preventable. In adult retinal vascular diseases, most notably diabetic retinopathy (DR), OCT and OCTA can detect and quantify disease features such as diabetic macular edema (DME) and retinal neovascularization (NV) before they are noted clinically, enabling earlier treatment and reducing the risk of blindness from RD. However, evaluating the use of this technology in neonates requires high speed and portable technology, and the commercially available handheld OCTs are too slow for ultra-widefield (UWF) OCT and OCTA imaging. Several groups (including our own) have published preliminary results using prototype 100 to 200 kHz swept- source (SS) OCT systems, however consistent data acquisition remains challenging due to the lack of fixation and subsequent motion in an awake neonate, which has limited the evaluation of the potential benefits of the technology in this population. Recently, there has been much interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) (specifically deep learning), which relies on high speed graphics processing units (GPUs) to provide real time OCT image processing, segmentation, and tracking. This application addresses 2 fundamental gaps in knowledge: (1) Can we overcome the technical challenges through the development of a faster ultrawide-field view SS-OCT system coupled with a GPU-enabled DL software system to enable consistent data acquisition in neonates? (2) Would quantitative objective metrics of ROP improve objectivity of ROP diagnosis and detect subclinical signs of disease progression which may enable earlier intervention and improved outcomes in the future. By leveraging our institution’s OCT, AI, and ROP expertise, we will address these questions in three specific aims: (1) Develop an ultra-high speed, handheld, panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA system. (2) Develop real time GPU accelerated intelligent image acquisition software. (3) Evaluate the clinical significance OCT derived biomarkers. Successful translation of this technology to the ROP population could improve the accuracy and objectivity of ROP diagnosis, and lead to earlier intervention and improved outcomes in patients with severe ROP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) have proven the ability to detect subclinical disease, provide quantitative evaluation of disease progression, and improve outcomes in the leading causes of blindness in adults, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Technological and practical limitations have limited the application of this technology in routine use for non-sedated children undergoing routine screening for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), the leading cause of blindness in children. The proposed project will develop an ultra-high speed, handheld OCT system with graphics processing unit (GPU) enabled real-time processing to improve the feasibility of panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA imaging in non-sedated neonates and evaluate the clinical utility of OCT-derived biomarkers in ROP.",Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity,9943875,R01EY031331,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyes', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Natural History', 'Neonatal', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Retina', 'Retinal Detachment', 'Retinal Neovascularization', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visualization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'disorder of macula of retina', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'macular edema', 'neonate', 'neovascularization', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'overtreatment', 'parallel computer', 'portability', 'prototype', 'real-time images', 'research clinical testing', 'routine screening', 'sample fixation', 'software systems', 'standard of care', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,341800,-0.03385188084841692
"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features.

"Robust AI to develop risk models in retinopathy of prematurity using deep learning ROP is a retinal neovascular disease affecting preterm infants, and is a leading cause of childhood blindness worldwide. Known clinical risk factors include preterm birth, low birthweight and use of supplemental oxygen but improved risk models are needed to identify infants that progress to treatment requiring disease and blindness. Deep learning techniques have been used to successfully identify “plus” disease in multi- institutional cohorts and to provide a continuous measure of disease severity. A major limitation of deep learning, however, is the need for large amounts of well curated datasets. Other limitations include overfitting and “brittleness” that can cause model performance to drop on external data. There are, however, numerous barriers to building and hosting these large central repositories with multi-institutional data required for robust deep learning including concerns about data sharing, regulations costs, patient privacy and intellectual property. In this project, we aim to demonstrate the utility of distributed/federated deep learning approaches where the data are located within institutions, but model parameters are shared with a central server. A major challenge thwarting this research, however, is the requirement for large quantities of labeled image data to train deep learning models. Efforts to create large public centralized collections of image data are hindered by barriers to data sharing, costs of image de-identification, patient privacy concerns, and control over how data are used. Current deep learning models that are being built using data from one or a few institutions are limited by potential overfitting and poor generalizability. Instead of centralizing or sharing patient images, we aim to distribute the training of deep learning models across institutions with computations performed on their local image data. Specifically, we seek to build robust risk models for predicting treatment requiring disease. Two large cohorts will be used to validate the hypothesis that the performance of the risk models using distributed learning approaches that of centrally hosted and is more robust than models built on single institutional datasets.

"Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement ABSTRACT This proposal aims to develop deep learning methods to automate the extraction of morphological imaging features relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA), and total knee replacement. While, quantitative evaluation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in OA research in the clinical setting MR reports often tend to be subjective, qualitative, and the grading schemes utilized in epidemiological research are not used because they are extraordinarily time consuming and do not lend themselves to the demands of todays changing healthcare scenario. The “Big Data” challenge and opportunity facing us makes it necessary to build enabling tools (i) to automate the extraction of morphological OA imaging features, with the aim of evaluating disease progression prediction capabilities on larger sample sizes that have never been explored before; (ii) to discover latent patterns by uncovering unexplored data-driven imaging features by the application of state of the art deep learning approaches (1); (iii) combine multi-modality imaging with clinical, functional, activity, and other data to define the trajectory of joint degeneration in OA. Leveraging the power of these state of the art techniques, and with the extraordinary availability of a large datasets of annotated images; in this project, we propose to develop an automatic post-processing pipeline able to segment musculoskeletal tissues and identify morphological OA features in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), as defined by commonly used MRI grading systems. Automation of morphological grading of the tissues in the joint would be a significant breakthrough in both OA research and clinical practice. It would enable the analysis of large sample sizes, assist the radiologist/clinician in the grading of images, take a relatively short amount of time, reduce cost, and could potentially, improve classification models. The availability of automatic pipelines for the identification of morphological abnormities in MRI would drastically change clinical practice, and include semi-quantitative grades, rather than subjective impressions in radiology clinical reports. In this study, we also aim to develop a complete supervised deep learning approach to obtain data-driven representations as non-linear and semantic aggregation among elementary features able to exploit the latent information hidden in the complexity of a 3D MR images, eliminating the need for nominal grades of selected features. This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning is revolutionizing medical imaging by solving challenging problems in disease classification, progression and therapeutic response. In this project, we focus on using deep learning methodology on magnetic resonance images of the knee to study osteoarthritis prevalence, and progression. The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,10193990,R33AR073552,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cartilage', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Models', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Subchondral Cyst', 'Supervision', 'Synovitis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'automated segmentation', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disease classification', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'joint destruction', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R33,2020,403748,0.03795525611768727
"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation. This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning.

"Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy Project Summary/Abstract Diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy (LR) currently relies on a qualitative interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and lacks standardization. This has led to inconsistent treatment and rising costs, while quality of life metrics have remained stagnant. To standardize the diagnosis of LR, the subjective and qualitative radiologic assessment needs to be augmented with accurate measurements of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas, two anatomical structures that are critical to the etiology of LR. However, precise measurements will require manual delineations of these regions on MRI. This is a tedious and time-consuming process that is not feasible on a daily, large-scale basis in the clinic. Deep Learning (DL) is a relatively new machine learning technique, which holds the promise of automating NF and CC segmentation. None the less, there remain several challenges to making DL-based segmentation routine in clinical practice. First, training and validating a DL model for segmentation of a given anatomical structure requires a large amount of expert annotated training data. Expert annotated data is expensive and time consuming to obtain, thus thwarting the development of quantitative imaging diagnostics for LR. To address this, we propose an expert-led manual delineation of NF and CC using de-identified MRI data extracted from UCLA's picture archiving and communications system (PACS). We expect the resulting database to contain data from over 35,000 lumbar MRI scans, with associated clinical history, demographics, and patient outcomes data. In a subset (1000) of these data, NFs and CCs will be annotated by multiple human expert raters. The consensus of these delineations will be used as ground truth segmentations to train, validate and improve our understanding of DL models. Secondly, as a part of this proposal, we aim to address several technical challenges that limit the deployment of automated image segmentation techniques to the clinic. Chief amongst these challenges is the failure of automated methodologies in the face of variation due to factors such as pathology, scanner protocol alterations, and general demographic variation. Additionally, our current understanding of DL does not allow us to categorically state the total number of expert annotated data that will be needed to train a model with a specified level of accuracy. Finally, we do not currently understand how selection of training cases for expert delineation affects generalization accuracy. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose experiments to define the relationship between DL algorithms and the cardinality of training data. We will also explore the use of unsupervised machine learning strategies, namely clustering and reinforcement learning, to understand how training data selection influences algorithmic accuracy. In summary, we propose to address data availability and technical knowledge gaps to the development of accurate DL-based techniques for automated NF and CC delineation, with a broader view to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of LR. Project Narrative Basing radiological diagnoses on a quantitative characterization of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas would greatly improve the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar radiculopathy (LR). Manual measurement of this anatomy on every clinical study is not feasible; however, deep learning- (DL) based automated methods can reliable perform this task if 1) expert annotations to train DL algorithms are available and 2) we can train DL models to work accurately despite image heterogeneity. We address these knowledge gaps by developing 1) a database containing spine MR images with expert annotation of NFs and CCs and 2) intelligent training data selection frameworks to train DL algorithms and assess their robustness to heterogeneity.",Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy,9928429,R21EB026665,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Central cord canal structure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Intelligence', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural History', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiculopathy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Diseases', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'segmentation algorithm', 'software infrastructure', 'theories', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment optimization', 'unsupervised learning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2020,195000,0.019026412983861315
"A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a massive amount of clinical three-dimensional (3D) cardiac image data available today in numerous hospitals, but such data has been considerably underutilized in both clinical and engineering analyses of cardiac function. These 3D data offers unique and valuable information, allowing researchers to develop innovative, personalized approaches to treat diseases. Furthermore, using these 3D datasets as input to computational models can facilitate a population-based analysis that can be used to quantify uncertainty in treatment procedures, and can be utilized for virtual clinical trials for innovative device development. However, there are several critical technical bottlenecks preventing simulation-based clinical evaluation a reality: 1) difficulty in automatic 3D reconstruction of thin complex structures such as heart valve leaflets from clinical images, 2) computational models are constructed without mesh correspondence, which makes it challenging to run batch simulations and conduct large patient population data analyses due to inconsistencies in model setups, and 3) computing time is long, which inhibits prompt feedback for clinical use.  A potential paradigm-changing solution to the challenges is to incorporate machine learning algorithms to expedite the geometry reconstruction and computational analysis procedures. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to develop a novel computing framework, using advanced tissue modeling and machine learning techniques, to automatically process pre-operative clinical image data and predict post-operative clinical outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) intervention will serve as a testbed for the modeling methods. In Aim 1, we will develop novel shape dictionary learning (SDL) based methods for automatic reconstruction of TAVR patient aortic valves. Through the modeling process, mesh correspondence will be established across the patient geometric models. The distribution and variation of TAVR patient geometries will be described by statistical shape models (SSMs). In Aim 2, population-based FE analysis of the TAVR procedure will be conducted on thousands of virtual patient models generated by the SSMs (Aim 1). A deep neural network (DNN) will be developed and trained to learn the relationship between the TAVR FE inputs and outputs. Successful completion of this study will result in a ML-FE surrogate for TAVR analysis, combining the automated TAVR patient geometry reconstruction algorithms and the trained DNN, to provide fast TAVR biomechanics analysis without extensive re-computing of the model. Furthermore, the algorithms developed in this study can be generalized for other applications and devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current clinical image modalities can be utilized to develop patient-specific computational models to pre-operatively plan transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. However, the computational modeling and simulation processes are time-consuming, which limits clinical translatability. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to develop algorithms using machine learning techniques to rapidly process and predict TAVR computational simulation outcomes directly from clinical image data.",A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes,9973167,R01HL142036,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Extravasation', 'Feedback', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Valves', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Postoperative Period', 'Problem Sets', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Response Elements', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stents', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm training', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'calcification', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'population based', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing', 'simulation', 'speech recognition', 'time resolved data', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual clinical trial']",NHLBI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,383601,0.014605433351118231

"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",9886248,R01EB028146,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Fibrosis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Iron', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'body system', 'deep learning', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'magnetic field', 'magnetohydrodynamic', 'mathematical model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'time use', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,628575,0.002498144315302887
"Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research Project Summary Deep learning methods are showing great promise for advancing cancer research and could potentially improve clinical decision making in cancers such as primary brain glioma, where deep learning models have recently shown promising results in predicting isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and survival in these patients. A major challenge thwarting this research, however, is the requirement for large quantities of labeled image data to train deep learning models. Efforts to create large public centralized collections of image data are hindered by barriers to data sharing, costs of image de-identification, patient privacy concerns, and control over how data are used. Current deep learning models that are being built using data from one or a few institutions are limited by potential overfitting and poor generalizability. Instead of centralizing or sharing patient images, we aim to distribute the training of deep learning models across institutions with computations performed on their local image data. Although our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, there are three key challenges to translating these methods into research practice: (1) data is heterogeneous among institutions in the amount and quality of data that could impair the distributed computations, (2) there are data security and privacy concerns, and (3) there are no software packages that implement distributed deep learning with medical images. We tackle these challenges by (1) optimizing and expanding our current methods of distributed deep learning to tackle challenges of data variability and data privacy/security, (2) creating a freely available software system for building deep learning models on multi- institutional data using distributed computation, and (3) evaluating our system to tackle deep learning problems in example use cases of classification and clinical prediction in primary brain cancer. Our approach is innovative in developing distributed deep learning methods that will address variations in data among different institutions, that protect patient privacy during distributed computations, and that enable sites to discover pertinent datasets and participate in creating deep learning models. Our work will be significant and impactful by overcoming critical hurdles that researchers face in tapping into multi-institutional patient data to create deep learning models on large collections of image data that are more representative of disease than data acquired from a single institution, while avoiding the hurdles to inter-institutional sharing of patient data. Ultimately, our methods will enable researchers to collaboratively develop more generalizable deep learning applications to advance cancer care by unlocking access to and leveraging huge amounts of multi-institutional image data. Although our clinical use case in developing this technology is primary brain cancer, our methods will generalize to all cancers, as well as to other types of data besides images for use in creating deep learning models, and will ultimately lead to robust deep learning applications that are expected to improve clinical care and outcomes in many types of cancer. Project Narrative We develop technology that will enable researchers to tap into the enormous amount of imaging data in multiple institutions to create deep learning models for cancer applications without requiring sharing of patient data. Our work will thus enable development of more robust deep learning models to improve clinical decision making in cancer than models currently built on data from single institutions. Although our focus is improving decision making in the primary brain cancer, our methods and tools are generalizable and will be broadly applicable to all cancers, with the potential for improvement in clinical care and patient health.",Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research,10018827,U01CA242879,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Brain', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Glioma', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Information Networks', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Privacy', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer type', 'care outcomes', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data privacy', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'learning strategy', 'molecular marker', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient privacy', 'radiologist', 'research to practice', 'software systems', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,394824,-0.012101219575282452
"Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT In the U.S., more than 600,000 knee osteoarthritis (OA)-related total knee joint replacement (TKR) cases are reported every year, exceeding $17 billion estimated direct costs annually. There is a growing need for disease- modifying therapies that prevent or delay the need for TKR. However, development of such therapies remains challenging due to the lack of objective and measurable OA biomarkers for disease progression. The course of the OA is highly variable between individuals and the OA progresses too slowly, making it difficult to identify sensitive OA biomarkers capable of capturing minor changes on the knee joint. This has slowed development of effective therapies and prevents physicians from providing the most effective advice about minimizing the need for TKR. In this project, our goal is to develop imaging biomarkers to monitor minor OA-related changes in knee joint health that lead to TKR. To achieve this goal, we will combine novel deep learning algorithms with clinical and imaging data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). The OAI dataset includes clinical data, biospecimens, radiographs, and magnetic resonance (MR) images collected over 8 years. The proposed project has three Specific Aims: (i) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from the bilateral posteroanterior fixed-flexion knee radiographs using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); (ii) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from structural and compositional MR images using 3D CNNs with RNNs combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); and (iii) to determine whether deep learning–based imaging biomarkers can act as surrogates to predict the OA progression using a subject cohort (n = 296) independent of the cohort used to identify imaging biomarkers. The proposed project will couple deep learning with diagnostic radiology to unveil key combinations of OA-relevant features directly from images with minimal user interaction. This will facilitate fast individualized assessment of OA progression using whole knee joint images directly. If successful, this study will bring new insights into the development of imaging biomarkers for OA progression and more broadly into our understanding and treatment of OA. The knowledge gained in this project will help to advance close monitoring of OA progression by opening new perspectives on the regions and parameters for potential inclusion in both intervention studies and clinical practice. NARRATIVE Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disorder of joints and is the most common reason leading to total knee joint replacement. Our proposed study aims to develop a novel automated OA-relevant imaging biomarker identification system based on radiographs, magnetic resonance images, and deep learning methods to study knee OA progression. We will address whether combining deep learning algorithms with medical images will determine the key combinations of features relevant to knee OA that are required to accurately predict the OA progression outcome.",Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis,9970413,R01AR074453,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Visit', 'arthropathies', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effective therapy', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'tool']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,497020,0.02352617060947144
"Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning Project Summary Positron-emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality that allows clinicians and researchers to study the physiological or pathological processes of the human body, and in particular the brain via the use of specific tracers. For brain PET imaging, patient head movement during scanning presents a challenge for accurate PET image reconstruction and subsequent quantitative analysis. Problems due to head motion are exacerbated by the long duration of the scans, with scan times commonly over one hour. Furthermore, some PET studies specifically involve subjects that either have trouble staying still due to psychological variations, e.g. patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, or psychological variations, e.g. subjects with anxiety disorders, or are required to participate in tasks that involve movement, e.g. smoking cigarettes while scanning. In brain scans, the average head motion can vary from 7 mm in clinical scans to triple this amount for longer research scans. Quantitatively, a 5 mm head motion can produce biases of up to ~35% in regional intensities and ∼15% in volume of distribution estimates, which could much larger than the difference observed in regional intensities or binding potential that distinguish different demographic groups being studied. The ability to track and correct head motion, therefore, would be of high utility in both clinical and research PET studies. In the past, many motion correction methods have been proposed. However, except for hardware-based approaches, there has been no method that can track frequent head motion on-the-fly during the PET acquisition. Hardware-based approaches are not readily available for clinical translation or used by other research facilities due to highly-customized software/hardware setup. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a data-driven methodology using deep learning to track and estimate rigid head motion using PET raw data, and incorporate both tracer type and time as conditional variables into this deep neural network design in order to handle diverse PET tracer types and their dynamic behavior. Overall, these solutions will provide for a data-driven motion estimation methodology to improve the quality of PET imaging. Specifically, we will start with the development and testing of our methodology for rigid head motion estimation using single-tracer PET raw data. Then we will perform evaluation of our multi-tracer motion estimation methodology applied to real PET data with a diverse range of tracers. Finally, in the exploratory phase, we will integrate time-of-flight information into deep learning-based motion prediction. The significance of this proposal is that it will allow for improved quality of PET imaging in real time and potentially allow for its use in clinical PET systems that do not have special motion tracking hardware. This work will serve as a first step towards developing data-driven motion estimation algorithms for full body PET imaging. The innovation lies in the development of what is a data-driven solution to the problem of real time motion estimation. Project Narrative Positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain is a highly useful tool for biomedical research and clinical practice. Head motion during scanning degrades PET image quality and introduces image artifacts. We propose to develop new data-driven methods, based on PET raw data, to estimate head motion using deep learning, which can be used for real time motion estimation in PET imaging.",Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning,9877261,R21EB028954,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology)', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological Processes', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Smoking', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neural network', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'research facility', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,243150,0.018401260663766406
"Task-aware and Autonomous Robotic C-arm Servoing for Flouroscopy-guided Interventions Project Summary Fluoroscopy guidance using C-arm X-ray systems is used in more than 17 million procedures across the US and constitutes the state-of-care for various percutaneous procedures, including internal ﬁxation of pelvic ring injuries. To infer procedural progress from 2D radiographs, well-deﬁned views onto anatomy must be achieved and restored multiple times during surgery. This process, known as ”ﬂuoro hunting”, is associated with 4.7 s of excessive ﬂuoroscopy time per C-arm position (c. f. 120 s total per ﬁxation), yielding radiographs that are never interpreted clinically, but drastically increasing procedure time and radiation dose to patient and surgical staff.  Our long-term project goal is to use concepts from machine learning and active vision to develop task-aware algorithms for autonomous robotic C-arm servoing that interpret intra-operative radiographs and autonomously adjust the C-arm pose to acquire ﬂuoroscopic images that are optimal for inference. We have three speciﬁc aims: 1) Detecting unfavorable K-wire trajectories from monoplane ﬂuoroscopy images: We will extend a physics-based sim- ulation framework for ﬂuoroscopy from CT that enables fast generation of structured and realistic radiographs documenting procedural progress. Based on this data, we will train a state-of-the-art convolutional neural net- work that interprets ﬂuoroscopic images to infer procedural progress. 2) Developing and validating a task-aware imaging system in silico: Using the autonomous interpretation tools and simulation pipeline available through Aim 1, we will train an artiﬁcial agent based on reinforcement learning and active vision. This agent will be capable of analyzing intra-operative ﬂuoroscopic images to autonomously adjust the C-arm pose to yield task- optimal views onto anatomy. 3) Demonstrating feasibility of our task-aware imaging concept ex vivo: Our third aim will establish task-aware C-arm imaging in controlled clinical environments. We will attempt internal ﬁxation of anterior pelvic ring fractures and our task-aware artiﬁcial agent will interpret intra-operatively acquired ra- diographs to infer procedural progress and suggest optimal C-arm poses that will be realized manually with an optically-tracked mobile C-arm system.  This work combines the expertise of a computer scientist, a surgical robotics expert, and an orthopedic trauma surgeon to explore the untapped, understudied area of autonomous imaging enabled by advances in machine learning in ﬂuoroscopy-guided procedures. This development has only recently been made feasible by innovations in fast ﬂuoroscopy simulation from CT to provide structured data for training that is sufﬁciently realistic to warrant generalization to clinical data. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to investigate autonomous and task-aware C-arm imaging systems, paving the way for a new paradigm in medical image acquisition, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients by task-oriented image acquisition on a patient-speciﬁc basis. Subsequent R01 funding will customize this concept to other high-volume procedures, such as vertebroplasty. Project Narrative Fluoroscopy guidance using C-arm X-ray systems is the state-of-care for percutaneous fracture ﬁxation, and requires surgeons to achieve and reproduce well deﬁned views onto anatomy to infer procedural progress. This requirement alone is estimated to contribute 4.7 s of ﬂuoroscopy time per C-arm repositioning (c. f. 120 s total per ﬁxation), drastically increasing procedure time and radiation dose to patient and surgical team.

"Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before heart attacks occur and is currently used to predict risk in millions of patients annually. Under the current grant, we have established a unique collaborative multicenter registry including over 23,000 imaging datasets (REFINE SPECT) with both prognostic (major adverse cardiovascular events) and diagnostic (invasive catheterization) outcomes. Using this registry, we have demonstrated that a combination of MPS image analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) tools achieved superior predictive performance compared to visual assessment by experienced readers or current state-of-the-art quantitative techniques. In the renewal, we plan to expand REFINE SPECT with now-available enhanced datasets (adding CT and myocardial blood flow information) and leverage latest AI advances to provide a personalized decision support tool for patient-specific cardiovascular risk assessment and estimation of benefit from revascularization following MPS. The overall aim is to optimize the clinical capabilities of MPS in risk prediction and treatment guidance by integrating all available imaging and clinical data with state-of-the-art AI methods. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: (1) To expand and enhance our REFINE SPECT registry including CT and MPS flow data, (2) To develop fully automated techniques for all MPS and CT image analysis, (3) To apply explainable deep learning time-to-event AI models for optimal prediction of MACE and benefit from revascularization from all image and clinical data. This work will result in an immediately deployable clinical tool, which will optimally predict risk of adverse events and establish the relative benefits from specific therapies, beyond what is possible by subjective visual analysis and mental integration of all imaging (MPS, CT, flow), and clinical data by physicians. Such quantitative integrative methods are not yet available, leaving the current practice for assessing risk and recommending therapy highly subjective. The precise quantitative results will be presented to clinicians in easy to understand terms (e.g., % risk per year, or relative risk of one therapy vs. the alternative) for a specific patient. Additionally, our methods to make AI conclusions more tangible will improve adoption of this technology. All results will be derived fully automatically thus eliminating any variability. Our approach will fit into current MPS practice and will be immediately translatable to clinics worldwide. Most importantly, this research will allow patients to benefit from increased precision and accuracy in risk assessment, thereby optimizing the use of imaging in guiding patient management decisions and ultimately improving outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myocardial perfusion imaging with SPECT is often used to predict who is at risk of heart attack and should undergo treatment such as coronary bypass or stenting; however, physicians read images visually and report results with wide variability.

"Machine learning for fast motion compensated quantitative abdominal DCE-MRI Project Summary: Functional imaging with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) provides important physiological markers of permeability, perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), a measure of kidney function, without exposing patients to ionizing radiation. DCE-MR images are at the same time used for evaluation of anatomy. Functional markers from DCE-MRI, if computed accurately, would play a critical role in diagnosing and assessing the progression of a number of pediatric diseases including those compromising kidney function, liver diseases, tumors, and Crohn's disease. One of the most important applications of DCE-MRI is assessing kidney function (GFR) in hydronephrosis patients with obstruction. In the absence of GFR information, children who stand to benefit from immediate surgical reconstruction might be overlooked or delayed in receiving treatment, and those who might benefit from a more conservative approach (i.e., “watchful waiting”) might receive an unnecessary surgical intervention. While the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3), yields some useful diagnostic information, it is slow, provides low resolution, does not offer anatomic detail, and delivers potentially harmful ionizing radiation. There is a clinical need for accurate computation of quantitative functional markers. Unfortunately, current methods of DCE-MRI in neonates and children are less than optimal, and therefore, DCE-MRI is underutilized in clinical practice. The technical challenges include insufficient temporal resolution to capture fast arterial input function (AIF) dynamics (which are required for accurate computation of quantitative markers), unavoidable respiratory motion and bulk motion (which reduce image quality and significantly lower the accuracy of parameter estimates), and a lack of robust, fast, automated post processing techniques for accurate computation of markers. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need to develop a motion-compensated, high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI method addressing these challenges. The primary objective of this exploratory, three-year study, is three-fold: first, to develop and evaluate a new bulk and respiratory motion-compensated, high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI technique for accurate estimation of functional markers; second, to further improve the robustness and speed of DCE-MRI using a fast, deep learning (DL) technique with integrated temporal prior for the reconstruction of motion-compensated, higher quality, high temporal resolution images; and third, to develop an automatic quantitative analysis pipeline including segmentation and tracer kinetic model-fitting using DL techniques for fast, robust and accurate quantification of functional markers. The successful completion of these aims will provide new, clinically important abdominal imaging capabilities, with real-time, motion-compensated image reconstruction and reliable real-time parameter estimation from high temporal and spatial resolution DCE-MRI. This work will extend the usefulness of DCE-MRI to pediatric patients who are unable to remain still in the scanner, and eliminate the need for repeated scans and sedation in infants. ! !

"Lymph Node Quantification System for Multisite Clinical Trials Project Summary / Abstract In patients with lymphomas and other cancers, quantitative evaluation of the extent of tumor burden is im- portant for staging, restaging, and assessment of therapeutic response or relapse; yet measurement of overall tumor burden is challenging with current tools, particularly when lymph nodes are confluent or difficult to fully differentiate from surrounding structures. Precision medicine and novel therapeutics are emphasizing the need to introduce a risk-adapted approach to tailor appropriate treatment strategies for cancer patients. The ability to quantitatively assess cancer phenotypes with functional and anatomical imaging that could efficiently and ac- curately map patients to gene expression profiling, clinical information, matching cohorts, and novel treatment regimens could potentially result in more optimal management of patients with cancer.  This Academic-Industry Partnership aims to translate recently developed technologies for semi- automated image segmentation and quantification of lymph nodes into robust tools and integrate them into an existing cloud-based system for management of multicenter oncology clinical trials. The ability to semi- automatically segment lymph node pathology with computed tomography (CT), as well as quantify nodal me- tabolism with positron emission tomography (PET) will enable comprehensive tracking of morphological and functional changes related to disease progression and treatment response.  Since 2004, the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center's (DF/HCC) Tumor Imaging Metrics Core (TIMC) has developed the Precision Imaging Metrics, LLC (PIM) platform to manage clinical trial image assessment workflows. Currently, there are nearly 50,000 consistently measured lymph node measurements in the TIMC database. The PIM system is used to make over 20,000 time point imaging assessments per year at eight NCI- designated Cancer Centers and aims to grow quickly by transitioning to a fully cloud-hosted system.  Given sufficient training data, state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technolo- gies can meet or even exceed human performance on specific imaging analysis tasks. Recent studies have indicated that AI-based lymph node segmentation from CT scans is nearing human performance levels, and we will extend and translate this work into a commercial tool. Specifically, our aim is to translate recent ad- vancements in AI-based segmentation into deployable services, and integrate these services into the clinical trial workflow. The proposed system will be designed to incorporate expert feedback provided by image ana- lysts and radiologists back into the ground truth dataset, allowing for continuous improvement in accuracy and clinical acceptance. We will extend our semi-automatic CT segmentation technologies to quantify lymph node metabolism in PET/CT, using lymphoma as the model disease. Integration of these technologies with PIM will provide an ongoing source of consistently measured quantitative data across a network of cancer centers. Project Narrative Advanced quantitative imaging is underutilized in oncologic clinical practice and research because the time investment entailed in manual lesion segmentation remains prohibitive. This partnership proposes to integrate machine learning based quantitative imaging tools into the existing Precision Imaging Metrics, LLC clinical trial image management system. We will use data from the centralized Tumor Imaging Metrics Core at the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center to produce ground truth training data and develop semi-automated multimodali- ty lesion analysis for patients with cancer.",Lymph Node Quantification System for Multisite Clinical Trials,10003193,R01CA235589,"['Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Goals', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Informatics', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'NCI-Designated Cancer Center', 'Nodal', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Services', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Burden', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anatomic imaging', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'glucose metabolism', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'lymph nodes', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'success', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,607952,-0.03912554110190645
"Plaque Risk Stratification Using Routinely Available CCTA to Optimize Therapeutic Decision-making in Patients with Known or Suspected Coronary Artery Disease Project Summary/Abstract New treatments have been revolutionary in improving outcomes over the last 30 years, yet cardiovascular disease still exerts a $320B annual burden on the US economy. Increasing evidence is showing that Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides. Currently available solutions do not overcome the barriers – a new approach is needed. Elucid Bioimaging has developed an image analysis software product vascuCAP (CAP stands for Computer Aided Phenotyping) to accurately quantify structural and morphological characteristics of plaque tissues linked to plaque rupture vulnerability. Fundamental to our approach is validated, objective quantitative accuracy; vascuCAP enjoys the most robust and well documented analytic validation of any plaque morphology software available. vascuCAP is the only system to mitigate specific issues in CT reconstruction known to effect accurate measurement of atherosclerotic plaque composition in routinely acquired CTA; it is the only system to effectively leverage objective tissue characterization validated by histology across multiple arterial beds; it achieves an effective resolution with routinely acquired CTA in the same ballpark as IVUS VH, based on solid mathematics principles that respect the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem; and it innovates by novel reporting that expresses the findings in a manner that fits efficiently into existing clinical workflows. vascuCAP has been implemented in a client-server model supporting SaaS. Working from our strong current device clearances, this research strategy is developed based on approved meeting notes from the FDA pre-submission process Phenotype classification claims to be cleared through direct De Novo pathway on the basis of accurately determining the class from in vivo CTA data relative to pathologist annotation on ex vivo specimen data. Risk prediction claims: validate ability to predict adverse events at one year, adding the IFU according to the direct De Novo pathway, One does not strictly depend on the other.This proposal is innovative in dealing with two fundamental limitations of the application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to the analysis of atherosclerosis imaging data. This proposal maximizes use of available retrospective data while putting in place the necessary structure for prospective validation and scale up. This proposal further develops vascuCAP as a tool that may reduce cost and length of clinical trials. While out of scope for this grant, it is important to also note that vascuCAP is innovative in its ability to support multi-scale modeling across cellular/molecular-level analyses and macroscopic manifestation. Also, vascuCAP’s quantitative ability makes it ideal for analysis of more advanced CT imaging protocols. These attributes complement and support the proposed objectives. Project Narrative Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides which currently available solutions do not overcome.

"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD. The developed methods respond to critical needs in the field of stone disease and will advance the ability of physicians to optimally direct patient therapy and scientists to phenotype research subjects. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will develop imaging techniques that can determine urinary stone composition and fragility in patients. The significance of this is that these advanced CT imaging techniques will allow physicians to more efficiently direct patient therapy and perform clinical research, potentially avoiding procedures associated with higher risk or cost.","Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques",9936447,R01EB028591,"['Affect', 'Alkalies', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calcium Oxalate', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Subjects', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ureteroscopy', 'Uric Acid', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'calcium phosphate', 'clinical investigation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'health management', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'photon-counting detector', 'prevent', 'risk minimization', 'statistical learning', 'treatment strategy']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,357486,0.006434135850559109
"Development of a prototype software for automated PET/CT interpretation and reporting in thoracic cancer Abstract. In cancer, body-wide FDG-PET/CT is a prime modality for diagnosis, staging, and treatment assessment. Despite its paramount importance to enable precision medicine in cancer, no method is currently available for automated disease burden estimation and standardized reporting on PET/CT images regionally and globally in anatomic organs and lymph node zones within a body region or body-wide. Automated production- mode body-wide/ body-region-wide disease measurement with standardized reporting will foster cancer research discovery and will be of great interest to oncologists, radiologists/ nuclear medicine physicians, Medicare and private health insurers, and pharmaceutical companies that conduct clinical trials of new cancer therapeutics and currently rely on manual methods of response assessment. The overarching goal of this Phase I project is, therefore, to develop, validate, and demonstrate a prototype software for disease measurement and reporting via FDG-PET/CT in the above manner in one body region, namely thorax, based on innovative algorithms that are generalizable body-wide. The project has two aims: Aim 1: Develop, implement, and validate algorithms for disease burden estimation in thoracic cancer via FDG-PET/CT. Aim 2: Develop and demonstrate a prototype software implementing the above algorithms for disease measurement and reporting. Aim 1 will be accomplished in 3 stages: Tasks 1, 2: PET/CT image data sets which are radiologically near normal for the thoracic body region will be gathered from existing whole-body scans of 100 patients. In these data sets, 7 key anatomic organs and 5 key lymph node zones in the thorax will be delineated under expert guidance. These data will be used to build population fuzzy anatomy models following our established Automatic Anatomy Recognition (AAR) methodology. An additional 100 whole-body PET/CT scans of patients with different types of cancer will be gathered to test our methods. Using available commercial clinical software, the PET uptake properties of lesions in organs and diseased lymph nodes in lymph node zones will be measured manually and used as reference ground truth of disease burden. Task 3: Deep learning (DL) algorithms anatomically guided by AAR will be developed to very accurately localize (but not delineate) organs and lymph node zones in PET/CT images using the models. Task 4: Novel methods based on fuzzy principles will be developed to automatically tag and quantify pathological regions (without explicitly delineating them) within located organs and nodal zones, and the accuracy of disease measurement will be evaluated (Task 5). Aim 2 will be accomplished by incorporating the disease measurement methodology into a prototype software named AAR-DQ (Tasks 6, 7) based on our earlier software platform CAVASS. AAR-DQ will report disease burden in a hierarchical manner – (i) at the body-region level; (ii) at each organ/ lymph node zone level; (ii) at each lesion/ lymph node level. Expected milestones. Aim 1: AAR-DQ disease measurement not to deviate more than 10% from clinical ground truth measurement. Aim 2: Disease measurement/ reporting in under 5 minutes per patient PET/CT study. Automated production-mode body-wide/ body-region-wide disease measurement has numerous potential applications in cancer and other diseases and has considerable commercial potential.

"AI platform for microscopy image restoration and virtual staining AI Platform for Microscopy Image Restoration and Virtual Staining Project Summary:  Fluorescence microscopy has enabled many major discoveries in biomedical sciences. Despite the rapid advancements in optics, lasers, probes, cameras and novel techniques, major factors such as spatial and temporal resolution, light exposure, signal-to-noise, depth of penetration and probe spectra continue to limit the types of experiments that are possible. Deep learning (DL) algorithms are well suited for image-based problems like SNR/super-resolution restoration and virtual staining, which have great enabling potentials for microscopy experiments. Previously impossible experiments could be realized such as achieving high signal-to-noise and/or spatial-temporal resolution without photobleaching/phototoxicity; simultaneously observing many image channels without interfering with native processes, etc. This could pave the way for a quantum leap forward in microscopy-based discoveries that elucidate biological functions and the mechanisms of disorders, and enable new diagnostics and therapies for human diseases.  However, these new methods have not been widely translated to new microscopy experiments. The delay is due to several practical hurdles and challenges such as required expertise, computing and trust. In order to accelerate the adoption of DL in microscopy, novel AI platform tailored for biologists are needed for training, applying and validating DL models and outputs.  The present project aims to develop an AI platform for microscopy image restoration and virtual staining called AI for Restoring and Staining (AIRS) platform. With our collaborator, Dr. Hari Shroff (National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering) we have successfully created DL models for SNR restoration, super-resolution restoration and virtual staining for a variety of imaging conditions and organelles in our preliminary studies. The AIRS platform intends to (1)provide a comprehensive suite of validated DL models for microscopy restoration and virtual staining applications including SNR restoration, super-resolution restoration, spatial deconvolution, spectral unmixing, prediction of 3d from 2d images, organelle virtual staining and analysis; (2)provide plug and play for common microscopy experiments; (3)provide semi-automatic update training to tailor DL models to match advanced microscopy experiments; (4)provide user friendly support for new DL model training for pioneering microscopy experiments; (5)provide confidence scores to assess the output results by a DL model, (6) provide DL models that avoid image artifact (hallucination) and allow continuous learning and evolution; (7) and be able to access the required computing infrastructure and database connection. Project Narrative Deep learning (DL) algorithms have great enabling potentials for microscopy experiments. Previously impossible experiments could now be realized. This could pave the way for a quantum leap forward in microscopy-based discoveries.  Powered by deep learning and DRVision innovations and collaborating with Dr. Hari Shroff and 7 additional labs, this project aims to create an AI platform for microscopy image restorations and virtual staining called AI for restoring and staining (AIRS).

"Optimization of diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, and patient throughput for cardiac SPECT via advanced and clinically practical cardiac-respiratory motion correction and deep learning Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is widely used to detect and evaluate coronary artery disease. The goal of this project is to reduce the radiation dose and/or scan time of SPECT MPI by a combined factor of 16x, while maintaining or increasing diagnostic accuracy. This would enable SPECT MPI to be performed, e.g., with 4x reduced radiation dose and 4x shorter scan time (~2.5 minutes) than typical protocols. Radiation dose in SPECT MPI has been recognized as an important issue, accounting for ~25% of all radiation exposure to patients in medical imaging. Dose reduction particularly addresses the increased prevalence of obese patients (who receive higher dose) and younger cardiac patients (whose radiation risk is higher due to longer life expectancy). Reduction in scan time would improve comfort for elderly and infirm cardiac patients, while mitigating body-motion image artifacts and reducing healthcare costs by increasing clinical throughput. We will reduce dose and scan time through innovative image reconstruction methods that involve little or no cost and require no additional patient setup steps. We will employ new respiratory and cardiac motion compensation to reduce image artifacts, as well as new deep learning techniques, which will be used for both respiratory-signal estimation and high-performance denoising. We will methodically optimize these techniques and then validate our algorithms in multicenter clinical reader studies. SA1: Develop clinically practical respiratory motion surrogates for low-count studies. T1: Perfect data- driven respiratory surrogate estimation; T2: Optimize data-driven surrogate estimation at reduced counts; T3: Develop and clinically validate depth-sensing cameras for respiratory and body-motion surrogate estimation; T4: Generalization of data-driven surrogate estimation to SPECT systems not having a CT. SA2: Develop deep-learning reconstruction methods and optimize for diagnostic accuracy and dose/scan time. T1: Post-reconstruction DL denoising algorithms for 3D perfusion images for reduced-count and standard- count studies; T2: DL denoising algorithms for 4D cardiac-gated studies; T3: 4D reconstruction with embedded DL denoising, cardiac motion estimation and correction; and T4: DL reconstruction methods with both RMC and CMC, with projection data binned using respiratory surrogate signals derived in SA1. SA3: Perform multicenter clinical reader studies (6 clinicians, 3 institutions) to validate the new algorithms and compare to current clinically-available methods based on diagnostic performance and repeatability in assessing both perfusion and wall motion defects. T1: In comparison to baseline clinical reconstruction, evaluate added benefit of: a) including attenuation and scatter correction, and b) additionally including RMC; T2: Validate DL for improvement of perfusion and function (wall motion) task performance at full-count levels; and T3: Validate DL for improvement of task performance at reduced counts. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will employ new methods of image reconstruction and processing to reduce radiation dose and scan time in cardiac SPECT imaging, which is used 15-20 million times per year to evaluate coronary artery disease. Dose reduction is important because cardiac SPECT accounts for ~25% of all radiation exposure to the public due to medical imaging; reducing scan time would make SPECT more comfortable for elderly and infirm cardiac patients, while mitigating image artifacts, as well as and reducing healthcare costs by allowing more patients to be scanned per day. Our goal will be to achieve a combined 16x reduction in dose and scan time while maintaining or improving diagnostic accuracy, thereby permitting a 4x reduction in dose while reducing scan time from ~10 minutes to ~2.5 minutes.","Optimization of diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, and patient throughput for cardiac SPECT via advanced and clinically practical cardiac-respiratory motion correction and deep learning",10072432,R01HL154687,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Cardiac', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Exposure to', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institution', 'Left Ventricular Function', 'Life Expectancy', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'heart motion', 'hemodynamics', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'perfusion imaging', 'preservation', 'prognostic', 'quantum', 'radiation risk', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,786840,-0.0017523249419060989
"Machine learning accelerated on-line adaptive replanning Abstract. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop and test a novel machine learning (ML) accelerated On-Line Adaptive Replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided radiation therapy (RT) (MRgRT). During the multi-fraction RT process, the location, shape and size of tumors and normal organs vary significantly between the fractions. These interfraction variations are among the major factors that can limit the accuracy of RT targeting. The current standard practice of image-guided RT (IGRT), developed to address the interfraction variations based on cone-beam CT (CBCT), can only correct for translational errors, and thus does not fully account for interfraction changes. To address this issue, researchers recently introduced online adaptive replanning (OLAR) that generates a new plan based on the anatomy of the day and delivers the plan for the fraction. Currently, two main obstacles affect the success of OLAR: (1) the anatomy of the day cannot be delineated accurately based on CBCT, and (2) the time required to perform OLAR is long enough to render it impractical. One way to improve the delineation accuracy is to use MRI versus CT. MRI-guided OLAR is currently being introduced into the clinics to substantially improve RT targeting. However, the bottleneck is still the impractical length of time required to segment the anatomy of the day, which can exceed 30 minutes. Furthermore, available synthetic CT (sCT) generation methods are slow or inaccurate for MRI-guided OLAR. There is no method available to quickly and objective determine when OLAR is necessary. To address these issues, we plan to develop novel techniques in the MOLAR solution. We hypothesize that the MRI-based MOLAR solution will fully account for interfraction changes, thereby substantially improving tumor targeting during RT delivery and the effectiveness of RT. Specifically, we aim to (1) develop practical ML-based solutions to quickly determine the necessity of OLAR and to rapidly generate accurate synthetic CTs; (2) develop ML-based techniques to substantially accelerate segmentation for OLAR using a progressive three-step process; and (3) verify clinical practicality and effectiveness of MOLAR by retrospectively and prospectively applying the MOLAR on MRI sets to test its speed and effectiveness in accounting for interfraction variations. We will develop this novel MOLAR solution by forging unique collaborations between clinical physicists, radiation oncologists and industry developers via an established academic-industry partnership. The successful completion of this project will enable clinicians to routinely practice “image-plan-treat”, which is the optimal solution for MRgRT. This new paradigm will fully account for interfraction variations, improve tumor targeting, reduce normal tissue toxicity, and ultimately encourage clinicians to revise the current doses and/or dose fractionations to increase therapeutic gain, enhance patient quality of life, and/or substantially save on healthcare costs. Our proposed strategy represents a drastic departure from current practice. We firmly believe that this strategy is the future of RT delivery. Project Narrative: This R01 application proposes to develop and test a novel machine learning accelerated online adaptive replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided adaptive radiation therapy through a unique academic and industry partnership. The MOLAR solution aims to fully account for interfraction variations, thereby substantially improving the accuracy and effectiveness of radiation therapy (RT) for cancer.

"Automatic analysis of 3D skin images for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) severity assessment Project Summary More than 20,000 hematopoietic stem cell transplants (including bone marrow transplants) are performed in the U.S. each year to cure a range of diseases ranging from leukemias to sickle cell anemia to autoimmune deficiencies in children. Unfortunately, most long-term non-relapse survivors will die of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), which remains a disease of steadily increasing incidence and profound unmet need. A fundamental barrier in cGVHD management and research is a lack of sensitive and objective assessment tools that permit objective and reproducible measures of disease severity and progression. Skin is the most commonly affected organ in cGVHD and automated techniques capable of measuring precisely the surface area of involved skin in photographs may provide the tools necessary for effectively evaluating patient progress. We propose to (1) create the data set necessary to develop machine learning-based methods for the automatic analysis of cGVHD images, and (2) implement and evaluate these methods. Project Narrative  Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a lethal disease that affects most long-term hematopoietic stem cell transplant (including bone marrow transplants) recipients. Skin images are used to assess disease severity and progression but the technology required to quantitatively and reproducibly analyze these images is lacking.

"An Integrated Software Platform for Accelerating Image-Driven Ophthalmic Research and Driving New Insights and Endpoints to the Clinic ABSTRACT More than 20 million patients suffer from age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or glaucoma. These degenerative eye diseases develop over decades, and their prevalence is increasing. Retinal imaging technologies such as optical coherence tomography and adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy are essential tools in the investigation and management of eye disease. New quantitative biomarkers derived from these and other imaging modalities are critical to the clinical translation of emerging ophthalmic innovations. However, biomarker development in the era of artificial intelligence requires large volumes of annotated images and transparent, reproducible processes, which places new demands on the management of living subjects research, data sharing, and algorithm development. Unfortunately, current software platforms are not effective in integrating these data in a manner that meets specific requirements in ophthalmology, Our goal in this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR, consistent with objectives of the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science, is to create an integrated platform (PaaS) for the collection, curation, analysis, and sharing of ocular images and data. We will extend the capabilities of systems developed by the Advanced Ocular Imaging Program (AOIP), Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), which include: (a) LATTICE - a software solution that reduces costs, reduces errors, and improves communications in the management of living-subjects research; (b) MOSAIC - an image processing platform and algorithm library with traditional and AI-trained algorithms; and (c) The AOIP Image Bank - a Repository that houses images and data on 1578 fully-consent human research subjects. To create the integrative platform, we will address four aims: (a) Extend LATTICE to meet the workflow requirements of academic and sponsored research in local and multisite environments, including the extensible direct integration of data relevant to ocular studies; (b) Design and implement a hybrid (local + cloud) REPOSITORY architecture, data schema, knowledge ontology, and query architecture for Owners and Readers of data.; (c) Integrate and demonstrate LATTICE, REPOSITORY and MOSAIC into a continuous ocular science workflow and (d) integrate and demonstrate Lattice, Repository and Mosaic into a continuous ocular science workflow. Our Integrated Translational Imaging platform will enable ophthalmic innovators to translate sight-saving insights and interventions to the clinic faster, with less frustration, and greater confidence. Our proposal fills an important technology gap in the field of ophthalmic data science and biomarker development. While the number and type of imaging devices continues to grow, the tools to develop and deploy new biomarkers and clinical endpoints using these exquisite imaging devices has not kept pace. With this program we will enable a new generation of image-driven innovation to find its way to the clinic. Project Narrative With more than 20 million patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or glaucoma, it is crucial to develop non-invasive biomarkers as early predictors of eye disease and reliable tests of the safety and efficacy of new preventative and restorative therapies. To meet the unmet need for rapid access and analysis of ophthalmic research data for the discovery of these biomarkers, we will create an integrated platform (PaaS) for the collection, curation, sharing, and analysis of ocular images and data. If we meet our objectives, our platform will reduce the cost of clinical research and increase the speed of translating critical research insights to saving the sight of millions of patients.",An Integrated Software Platform for Accelerating Image-Driven Ophthalmic Research and Driving New Insights and Endpoints to the Clinic,9908389,R44EY031198,"['Address', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Docking', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundations', 'Frustration', 'Funding', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Housing', 'Human Subject Research', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Mosaicism', 'Ontology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Savings', 'Science', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Wisconsin', 'adaptive optics', 'algorithm development', 'algorithm training', 'application programming interface', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'fighting', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging program', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'microsystems', 'ocular imaging', 'process repeatability', 'programs', 'repository', 'retinal imaging', 'safety testing', 'software systems', 'structured data', 'tool', 'verification and validation', 'vision science']",NEI,"TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING INNOVATIONS, INC.",R44,2020,743347,-0.027309507767668946
"Sensory Cue Integration in Melanoma Screening Imaging biomarkers are features in images that have biological implications. For example, in a picture of a person with red hair, the red hair is a feature and the implication is that there is a mutation in the MC1R gene that provides instructions for making a protein called the melanocortin 1 receptor. This feature, an imaging biomarker, can be used as a medical cue to indicate increased risk for melanoma. When used in this context, this imaging biomarker becomes an imaging biomarker cue (IBC), in the sense that it may cue the medical professional observer to alter treatment accordingly, such as recommending sunscreen use. IBCs do not individually bear the full weight of medical decision-making and instead are integrated. IBC analysis may be a process of sensory cue integration or may be a process of observation and integration by technology such as a digital camera and computer. An advantage of the latter is that computational scalability enables machine vision to compute vast permutations of IBCs that would be overwhelming to a human observer. Thus computers can try many potential diagnostic methods rapidly before picking the best one to teach back to humans. The purpose of this project is to develop a human/machine interface for bi-directional teaching so expert dermatologists can teach computers what IBCs they use to achieve accurate diagnosis and computers can teach dermatologists the best way to use current IBCs and suggest integration of new IBCs that machine learning guides them to. As an outcome, we will measure the diagnostic performance of dermatologists who undergo IBC training in detecting melanoma. It is known that early detection saves lives, but the potential of technology to improve early detection, a great need since 10,000 Americans still die each year from melanoma, is unknown. This project will help answer that unknown and if we are successful in translating IBCs with commuter vision and machine learning, more melanomas will be detected early and lives will be saved. Our long-term goal is to reduce melanoma related deaths and unnecessary biopsies by helping clinicians increase the predictive value of dermoscopy-based melanoma screening. We believe sensitivity and specificity of dermoscopy- based melanoma screening for non-expert screeners can be improved by assistive technology, which is highly desirable given the cost of false positives (patient stress and unnecessary biopsies) and the extremely high cost of false negatives (delayed melanoma treatment). This project creates a technology to help medical personnel see and integrate features of abnormal skin spots that help them determine if the spot they are looking at is a melanoma. Since melanoma is deadly if left untreated, this technology helps them guide biopsy and surgical removal of skin to potentially cut more melanomas out (saving lives) and not cut so many benign lesions out unnecessarily (leaving less scars). Our augmentation of vision and cognition uses machine learning in a way that is visually intuitive so physicians may be able to show their patients the rationale behind the choice to surgically excise abnormal skin spots or not to.",Sensory Cue Integration in Melanoma Screening,10025420,R21CA240254,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area Under Curve', 'Back', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cessation of life', 'Cicatrix', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complement Factor D', 'Computers', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermoscopy', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Hair', 'Health Personnel', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Instruction', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Melanocortin 1 Receptor', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mole the mammal', 'Mutation', 'Nevus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Screening Result', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Skin', 'Skin Abnormalities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Sunscreening Agents', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Ursidae Family', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'graphical user interface', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'melanoma', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'screening', 'success', 'vector']",NCI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,412585,-0.0013432288226407916
"Automated Detection and Classification of Laryngeal Diseases Using Deep Neural Networks PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this project is to improve the care of patients with laryngeal disorders through development of automated diagnostic support for in-office flexible laryngoscopy. To accomplish this goal, we propose developing neural network-based algorithms to detect and classify structural laryngeal lesions in laryngoscopy images. An automated diagnostic tool for in-office laryngoscopy such as we propose will have several benefits: (1) It will improve access to care for patients with symptoms of laryngeal dysfunction living in communities with limited otolaryngology resources, (2) It will improve early detection of laryngeal cancers potentially reducing the morbidity of treatment, and (3) It will prove a valuable teaching tool for students and residents first learning to interpret laryngoscopic exams. Flexible laryngoscopy is a common in-office procedure performed by otolaryngologists to evaluate the upper aerodigestive tract in patients with symptoms of laryngeal dysfunction. Subtle differences in the appearance of laryngeal lesions enable otolaryngologists to differentiate benign lesions from suspected malignant ones. The expertise and clinical acumen to correctly interpret laryngoscopic findings requires years of training and therefore laryngoscopy is largely only performed in subspecialty otolaryngology clinics. The primary objective of this project is to develop neural network-based algorithms to detect and classify structural laryngeal lesions. Our hypothesis is that these algorithms can be trained using a large dataset of laryngeal images to accurately detect and classify structural laryngeal lesions on flexible laryngoscopic exam. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: (1) Generate a dataset of high-quality, labeled endoscopic laryngeal images corresponding to normal and structural lesions of the larynx, (2) Develop a location-aware anchor-based reasoning neural network for accurate detection of laryngeal lesions, and (3) Develop an adaptive network model for classification of structural laryngeal pathologies including papilloma, polyp, leukoplakia and suspected malignancy. With expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of laryngeal disorders and computer vision, including object detection and classification, our multidisciplinary team is uniquely qualified to complete this project. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to revolutionize in-office laryngoscopy through development of a deep neural network-based automated detection and classification system for diagnosis of structural diseases of the larynx. Currently, flexible laryngoscopy is only performed by expert subspecialists with years of experience because developing the expertise and clinical acumen to correctly interpret laryngoscopic findings requires years of training. Through development of deep neural network-based algorithms to detect and classify laryngeal lesions on in- office laryngoscopy, we will improve access to care for patients living in communities without subspecialty otolaryngology care and will develop an important teaching tool for clinicians learning to interpret laryngoscopic exams.",Automated Detection and Classification of Laryngeal Diseases Using Deep Neural Networks,10043172,R03CA253212,"['Aerodigestive Tract', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Benign', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Fellowship', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hoarseness', 'Image', 'Improve Access', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Laryngeal Diseases', 'Laryngoscopes', 'Laryngoscopy', 'Larynx', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Leukoplakia', 'Location', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of larynx', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Network-based', 'Normal Range', 'Otolaryngologist', 'Otolaryngology', 'Papilloma', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plug-in', 'Polyps', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Vision research', 'Work', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'detector', 'digital', 'experience', 'feature extraction', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'neural network', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2020,154375,-0.027354366845829085
"Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC) Project Summary/Abstract The ability to access huge cohorts of patient medical records and radiology data, the emergence of ever-more detailed imaging modalities, and the availability of unprecedented computer processing power marks the pos- sibility for a new era in neuroimaging, disease understanding, and patient treatment. To unlock the full medical potential made possible by these new technologies, new algorithms and clinically-relevant techniques must be developed by close collaboration between computer scientists, physicians, and medical researchers. We are excited to propose a national resource center with the goal of finding new ways of extracting disease characteristics from advanced imaging and computation, and to make these methods available to the larger medical community through a proven methodology of world-class research, open-source software, and exten- sive collaboration. The overarching theme for this P41 renewal is the discovery and analysis of novel imaging phenotypes to characterize disease. We use the term imaging phenotypes to describe patterns or features of disease that can be detected through imaging (predominantly MRI) followed by machine learning, statistical analysis, feature detection, and correlation with other indicators of disease such as structured patient infor- mation. The three proposed Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects address this common question us- ing a variety of complementary approaches and clinical testbeds. TR&D 1 addresses microstructure of tissue, including novel imaging methods to detect tumor microstructure. TR&D 2 investigates rich spatial patterns of disease extracted from clinical imaging with a focus on cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke. Finally, TR&D 3 proposes novel image and connectivity-based features that can be correlated with a variety of diseases, with a clinical emphasis on pediatric brain development. Technical innovation will be driven by intense collaboration between the TR&Ds and key collaborators in neurosurgery, neurology, and pe- diatrics. The TR&Ds will leverage recent important developments in the fields of image acquisition, machine learning, and data science to identify and exploit novel imaging phenotypes of disease. Building on our long history of developing clinically-relevant methods, each TR&D includes a translational and clinical validation aim to ensure our work is clinically relevant and effective at meeting the driving clinical goals. NAC's proven software engi- neering, translation, and dissemination infrastructure, along with its established network of academic, medical, and industrial partners, enhance the center's value as a national resource.

"IEEE Medical Imaging Conference Abstract  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) is the leading international scientific meeting bringing together a broad community interested in the physics, engineering and mathematical aspects of medical imaging, with special emphasis on nuclear medicine and multi-modal systems. The MIC runs in conjunction with the IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS) and the Workshop on Room Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detectors (RTSD).  The purpose of the MIC is to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. While the traditional topics of primary interest are related to nuclear medicine techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), increasing space will be also given to recently evolving imaging modalities such as X-ray, CT, optical, MR, with special emphasis on their multi-modal combination with nuclear medical imaging. Recently there has also been additional interest in employing deep learning and AI to enhance the field medical imaging. The conference provides a well-established forum of scientific exchange and dialogue between researchers in academia, industry, and government as well as education of the public, with special emphasis on young generations. This is reflected by the large spectrum of educational refresher sessions and short courses. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks $10,000 in funding for each of the next three years to provide 20 trainee grants of $500 each to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration, housing and/or short course fees for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions.  We anticipate that the main impact of this grant program will be to increase attendance of students and postdocs at the 2020 meeting, especially those typically underrepresented, as well as to support their participation in educational activities. It is important to bring young generations, especially women, minorities, and those with disabilities, into the medical imaging field, where they could become main actors in the coming years. They will attend plenary and oral presentations given by many of the world leaders in the nuclear medical imaging instrumentation, image processing, and quantitative analysis fields. Moreover, they will be given the unique opportunity of direct personal interaction through the short courses and dedicated poster presentations. In turn their work will be exposed to the other participants for critical evaluation, constructive suggestions and dissemination. Furthermore, many of these trainees will likely continue in this field, thereby contributing to advancing technology with high societal relevance as being increasingly used in the clinical management of disease and therapeutic interventions. Narrative  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) has the purpose to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. The conference covers a variety of medical imaging topics including quantitative imaging, PET/SPECT techniques, image reconstruction, imaging in radiation therapy, portable imaging, multi-modality systems, new medical imaging technologies, CT/MR/optical/ultrasound, parametric/kinetic image modeling, and signal/image processing and modeling.

"Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers Project Summary Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) has been proposed as a technique to quantify tissue parameters, such as T1 and T2 relaxation times, which are biomarkers for various pathologies. One assumption of MRF is that the signal in each voxel is generated by exactly one set of tissue parameters. Due to MRI resolution at the range of millimeter in combination with the cellular structure of biological tissue, each voxel consists of multiple tissue compartments. An over-simplified single compartment model results in apparent relaxation times that are influenced by the relaxation times and the fractional proton densities of all contributing compartments. This can lead to a misinterpretation of signal changes. For example, in diseases that causes demyelination in white matter (Multiple Sclerosis, Dementia), a reduction of the myelin water fraction would result in a misleading change of the apparent relaxation time of the voxel. We propose a multi-compartment MRF method that allows to identify multiple tissue contributions within a voxel, including the fractional proton density (PD) of different compartments. Our machine learning based approach automatically identifies the number of compartments within each voxel that can be identified with the available SNR in that voxel. We will correct for partial-volume effects at the borders of two types of tissues, as well as analyze tissue microstructure. For the second case our learned model will also include chemical exchange between compartments. After an initial validation phase using numerical simulations, we will first perform MRF scans of dedicated 3D printed phantoms with multiple compartments. Our quality criterion is successful estimation of all simulated tissue compartments for all voxels with a relative error of less than 5% to the ground truth. We will then perform in-vivo MRF measurements of healthy volunteers (n=5). We will generate synthetic FLAIR and MP-RAGE contrasts from parameter maps estimated with conventional and the proposed multi-compartment MRF technique. We will compare them with currently used clinical contrasts acquired using established pulse sequences and validate the performance of our approach by measuring the cortical thickness. Further, we will validate the performance for microstructure composition in white matter. Our hypothesis is that it will be possible separate the compartments for myelin, intra- and extra-cellular water and compare the results to ex-vivo data found in literature. In summary, the methods developed in this R21 proposal will provide a novel technique to accurately and reproducibly identify biomarkers beyond the resolution of a voxel. It will allow to identify changes in tissue composition and fractional proton density at the microstructure level. Project Narrative The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish a MR imaging technique for quantifying biomarkers at the sub-voxel level. We will develop a machine learning based MR fingerprinting image reconstruction that enables the identification and characterization of multiple compartments within a voxel in terms of fractional proton density and relaxation times. We will generate accurate synthetic fluid suppressed images such as the FLAIR and MP- RAGE with accurate partial volume behavior and analyze the myelin water fraction and the corresponding relaxation times in white matter.",Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers,10016296,R21EB027241,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fingerprint', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'gray matter', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'millimeter', 'neuroimaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'physical process', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tissue biomarkers', 'white matter']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2020,252175,0.008687106524094787
"Neuroinformatics platform using machine learning and content-based image retrieval for neuroscience image data This project aims to develop NeuroManager™, an innovative neuroinformatics platform for advanced parsing, storing, aggregating, analyzing and sharing of complex neuroscience image data. A core technology that we will develop in NeuroManager will be Image Content Analysis for Retrieval Using Semantics (ICARUS), a novel, intelligent neuroimage curation system that will enable image retrieval based on visual appearance or by semantic concept. ICARUS will use machine learning applied to content-based image retrieval - (CBIR) to build and refine models that summarize microscopic and macroscopic image appearance and automatically assign semantic concepts to neuroimages. Neuroscience research generates extensive, multifaceted data that is considerably under-utilized because access to original raw data is typically maintained by the source lab. On the other hand, there are many advantages in sharing complex image data in neuroscience research, including the opportunity for separate analysis of raw data by other scientists from another perspective and improved reproducibility of scientific studies and their results. Unfortunately, none of the neuroscience data sharing options that exist today fulfill all the needs of neuroscientists. To solve this problem, NeuroManager will include the following distinct, significant innovations: (i) versatility for handling two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional neuroimaging data sets from animal models and humans; (ii) functionality to share complex datasets that extends secure, privacy-controlled paradigms from institutional, laboratory-based and even public domains; (iii) flexibility to implement NeuroManager within an institute’s IT infrastructure, or on most cloud-based virtualized environments including Azure, Google Cloud Services and Amazon Web Services; (iv) and most importantly, the ICARUS technology for CBIR in neuroimaging data sets. The benefit of NeuroManager for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be to foster collaboration between scientists and institutions, promoting innovation through combined expertise in an interdisciplinary atmosphere. This will open new horizons for better understanding the neuropathology associated with several human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions at various levels (i.e., macroscopically, microscopically, subcellularly and functionally), ultimately leading to an improved basis for developing novel treatment and prevention strategies for complex brain diseases. In Phase I we will prove feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype software that will perform CBIR on 2D whole slide images of coronal sections of entire mouse brains from ongoing research projects of our collaborators. Work in Phase II will focus on developing the commercial software product that will include all of the innovations mentioned above. A competing technology with comparable functionality, addressing the full breadth of needs for modern neuroscience research, is currently not available commercially or otherwise.

"Multi-modal and Extreme PET/MRI Reconstruction Methods Project Summary / Abstract  Hybrid PET/MRI systems are very advantageous for a variety of clinical applications by combining the soft tissue contrast of MRI with the functional and metabolic information of PET. These systems have found success for oncology studies, particularly in head and abdomen/pelvis, as well as for epilepsy, neurological diseases, heart disease, and pediatrics for dose reduction. However, the PET resolution and SNR is typically worse than MRI, and suffers from the loss of feature and data due to motion as well. PET/MRI systems offer the potential to create more accurate, higher resolution PET reconstructions, including correction of artifacts, motion, and im- proved localization, by performing synergistic reconstructions that leverage the simultaneous data acquisition. In particular, this fellowship proposes to develop novel physics-constrained machine learning models for informa- tion sharing between PET and MRI for enhanced spatial localization, estimation of attenuation and activity, and motion. We propose to develop a deep maximum-likelihood estimation of attenuation and activity (MLAA) that can compensate for artifacts and improve PET reconstruction accuracy. We also propose a motion-enhanced joint PET/MRI reconstruction to capture arbitrary motions and reduce dose requirements for chest and abdomen studies. Together, these models aim to improve the PET spatio-temporal resolution, SNR, and quantiﬁcation for a broad range of clinical applications, and will be evaluated for cancer assessment in the pelvis, liver, and lung.  This fellowship will be performed in the Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging at UCSF under the guidance of Prof. Peder Larson, who leads a research program on advanced imaging methods development, and Dr. Thomas Hope, a radiologist and nuclear medicine physician who leads multiple PET/MRI projects. The Department is one of the leading centers in biomedical imaging research, and has been at the forefront on translating PET/MRI systems into clinical practice. The UCSF PET/MRI scanner has dedicated research time, which is also available on other MRI and PET/CT research systems, and extensive computational resources to support the proposed project. The applicant, Dr. Abhejit Rajagopal, has a background in computational imaging and machine learning, will be jointly mentored by this engineer/physician team. He will be trained to become a biomedical imaging scientist by participating in formal coursework on medical imaging systems, training on the PET/MRI system, grant writing, and performing clinical research, supporting his development into a creative, independent biomedical researcher. Project Narrative  Hybrid positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) imaging systems cur- rently aid in diagnosis and prognosis of numerous types of cancer and disease, but are not always precise enough to accurately measure and track a patient’s response to therapy, particularly in organs and tissue that are sub- ject to motion. There is an unrealized potential here to synergistically combine complimentary PET-MRI data to dramatically improve the spatial resolution and SNR of PET, as well as to create motion-resolved 4D (x,y,z,t) imagery by combining information across modalities and time-frames to combat severe undersampling. These methods will be evaluated in human studies of cancer to capture ﬁne structure and micro-features on moving organs (e.g. lung nodules, liver metastases), ultimately aiding in quantitative characterization of disease.",Multi-modal and Extreme PET/MRI Reconstruction Methods,10069132,F32EB030411,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Chest', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Fellowship', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Implant', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metals', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Oncology', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Writing', 'attenuation', 'bioimaging', 'bone', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'combat', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'heart imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging modality', 'imaging scientist', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'information model', 'lung imaging', 'method development', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'programs', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'soft tissue', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'systems research', 'uptake']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2020,69426,0.022023507654817184
"Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is exceptionally common, with an estimated one hundred million afflicted people in the United States. Detection and risk stratification of this very common disease remains a major challenge. Despite recent advances, including development of numerous therapeutic agents presently in phase 2 and 3 trials, NAFLD remains a silent disease in which the vast majority of patients accumulate progressive liver damage without signs or symptoms and, undiagnosed, receive no medical care. The NAFLD patients at highest risk of cirrhosis are those with moderate or greater liver fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, a group of patients who are described as having high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH). The current reference standard for identifying people with hrNASH is liver biopsy, which is expensive, invasive, and limited by interobserver variability. The focus of this project is to develop and validate low cost non-invasive diagnostic technology to diagnose hrNASH. We propose to accomplish this in three Specific Aims. First, we will expand and annotate an existing database of patients with chronic liver disease from 328 subjects to 1,000 subjects, ~40% of whom will have NAFLD. The database will contain ~20,000 images (~10,000 ultrasound elastography images and ~ 10,000 conventional ultrasound images) and multiple demographic and clinical data points for each subject (a total of ~30,000 clinical, laboratory, and demographic data points). We have previously developed advanced image processing techniques to make ultrasound elastography more accurate and less variable. We will use this large database to develop, customize and refine our image processing techniques for NAFLD evaluation (Aim 1), with the goal of improving ultrasound elastography diagnosis of hrNASH. Second, we will combine conventional ultrasound elastography imaging, conventional ultrasound imaging, our advanced image analysis techniques, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data in a machine learning model to predict hrNASH and will compare the performance of our predictive model with the FIB4, a widely-used blood test-based prediction rule (Aim 2). Third, we will validate our predictive model in an independent prospective cohort of NAFLD subjects undergoing biopsy for NAFLD risk stratification (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the combination of image processing-enhanced elastography and conventional ultrasound imagery combined with demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will have greater predictive power for hrNASH than clinical or sonographic data alone. The proposed predictive models have the potential to (1) reduce the number of liver biopsies performed for hrNASH detection, (2) facilitate recruitment for clinical trials of NAFLD therapeutics, and (3) improve care quality for the most common liver disease in the United States. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to create low-cost non-invasive technology to diagnose people with high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH), a common liver disease that has a high risk of cirrhosis. We will accomplish this goal by improving liver ultrasound imaging and by creating a prediction tool that integrates liver ultrasound, laboratory testing and clinical information. This prediction tool has the potential to reduce the need for liver biopsies.","Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD",9850968,R01DK119860,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Caring', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II/III Trial', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective cohort', 'Quality of Care', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic liver disease', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'disorder subtype', 'elastography', 'hepatocellular injury', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'liver injury', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,442592,0.01470070804967738
"Quantitative MRI of Multiple Sclerosis - Resubmission - 1 Project Summary  In this project, we propose a novel T1 and T2 quantification method that generates quantitative T1 or T2 maps from weighted MR images. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used as a tool to diagnose Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and track lesional changes over time. Because MRI has various contrasts that display different information about the underlying tissue microstructure and physiology, it can potentially be used as a tool to predict MS disease progression and even disability. However, there is no known measure derived from MR images of MS that correlates well with clinical disability as described by the Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS). Previous efforts to correlate MRI features and EDSS have included calculating total lesion load on T1- and T2-weighted images, measuring the variations in the magnetic transfer ration of normal-appearing brain tissues, and calculating cerebral atrophy, each with a varying level of success. Yet, there has been little study of the evolution of relaxation times of the lesions over time and how it relates to disability. Because changes in the T1 (spin-lattice) and T2 (spin-spin) relaxation times of a tissue can reflect pathological changes in that tissue over time, quantitative T1 and T2 maps derived from MR images may be more indicative of microscopic changes that manifest as disability in MS patients.  The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) develop and validate novel T1 and T2 quantification method on spin-echo MR images, (2) extend the novel quantification method to common MS imaging sequences, and (3) apply the novel quantification method to MS datasets to predict EDSS using machine learning. Aim 1 will involve the validation of the quantification pipeline on both T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo MR images in vivo, resulting in a range of acceptable parameters for the novel quantification method. Aim 2 will extend the quantification pipeline to include commonly used and more complicated MS imaging sequences, again resulting in a range of acceptable parameters for the quantification method. Aim 3 will use the quantification pipeline to compare machine learning algorithms with and without quantification to determine the added value of quantification in the imaging of MS. Additionally, Aim 3 will result in a predictive machine learning model utilizing multiple imaging contrasts for the prediction of disability in MS. These results will provide a more thorough understanding of the role of MR quantification in the evaluation of neurological diseases, such as MS, and will offer a scientific foundation to extend the use of MR quantification as a potential imaging biomarker for other diseases and pathologies. Project Narrative The proposed research aims to develop and validate a T1 and T2 quantification method using internal reference values derived from T1- or T2-weighted MR images. This method will be applied to weighted images of patients who have been diagnosed Multiple Sclerosis and input into various classification algorithms to determine which method is most predictive of worsening clinical disability as described by the Expanded Disability Status Score. By doing this, we will determine the impact of this novel quantification method as a tool for both the analysis of patients with Multiple Sclerosis as well as a tool for the normalization of big MR datasets before being input into machine learning algorithms.",Quantitative MRI of Multiple Sclerosis - Resubmission - 1,10154293,F31NS118930,"['Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Attenuated', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demyelinations', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neuraxis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral atrophy', 'classification algorithm', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'data harmonization', 'digital', 'disability', 'gray matter', 'healthy volunteer', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'subcutaneous', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2020,45520,0.01883334025818071
"Optimizing Acquisition and Reconstruction of Under-sampled MRI for Signal Detection PROJECT SUMMARY Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a versatile imaging modality that suffers from slow acquisition times which is a challenge for both time sensitive applications and for patient throughput. Accelerating MRI would benefit patients both by reducing the time they need to be in the scanner and in reducing the cost of healthcare. This project is part of a larger scientific effort to accelerate MRI while maintaining the diagnostic quality. Acceleration, even by a factor of two would result in a major advance for public health. Two of the current approaches to accelerate MRI rely on collecting less data (under-sampling) and constrained or deep learning reconstruction. These approaches can lead to images with diagnostic quality with significant under-sampling but may suffer from artifacts which are hard to characterize. Specifically, this project will optimize the performance of constrained reconstruction and deep learning on detecting subtle lesions in acquiring and reconstructing under-sampled MRI. To carry out this optimization, we will first develop the methods required for detection of lesions by machine and human observer models. Then the models will be validated by psychophysical studies where humans perform the detection task. In the first aim of this project, we will optimize constrained reconstruction based on the ideal linear observer. We will consider under-sampled acquisition strategies in 2D MRI including one and two dimensional subsampling methods with constrained reconstruction using both wavelet and total variation constraints. We will perform simulations using anatomical backgrounds both for lesions which match the prior information of the constraints and those which do not to better understand how choices in acquisition and reconstruction affect ideal detection. While the ideal linear observer approximates the best possible detection, typically the signal detection is carried out by a human. In the second aim, we will optimize constrained reconstruction using human observer models and validate the models using human observer studies. A recent approach to reconstruction of under- sampled images is based on deep learning. In the third aim, this work will optimize deep learning reconstruction based on ideal and human observers. Due to the complexity of the deep learning approach, having this task-based approach to optimization is particularly relevant. This project will optimize a network using signal detection to better understand how training and architecture choices in the neural network affect detection of lesions which are not included in training images. This research project will help to strengthen the research environment at Manhattan College by involving students in biomedical research incorporating applied mathematics, statistics and data science.

"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and .

"Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) Overall Project Summary  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) pursues a mission of bringing people together to create new ways of seeing. The work of our Center has been focused on creating new paradigms for the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of biomedical images, and on implementing new collaboration models in order to translate these developments rapidly into clinical practice.  The world of biomedical imaging is changing, and CAI2R has been at the forefront of that change. Tasks that were once the sole domain of meticulously-engineered imaging hardware are now beginning to be accomplished in software, increasingly informed by diverse arrays of inexpensive auxiliary sensors. Information once pursued through the laborious acquisition of carefully separated image datasets is now being derived from newly integrated, and richly quantitative, data streams. In keeping with these themes, our Center will be organized around the following four Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects going forward: 1. Reimagining the Future of Scanning: Intelligent image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. 2. Unshackling the Scanners of the Future: Flexible, self-correcting, multisensor machines. 3. Enriching the Data Stream: MRI and PET in concert. 4. Revealing Microstructure: Biophysical modeling and validation for discovery and clinical care.  In each of these projects, we aim to push medical imaging technology to the next level, both in hardware and in software. Having made great strides in developing rapid, continuous imaging data streams, we will next aim to add key new information to those streams, both from physics-driven microstructural modeling and from data- driven machine learning. Having focused on the development of robust tools for image acquisition and reconstruction, we will extend the pipeline to image interpretation, using the results of human- or machine- derived evaluations of image content as feedback for the further improvement of acquisition strategies and sensor designs. We will also aim to close the loop between diagnostic sensing and therapeutic intervention, exploring new ways to guide therapy with continuously-acquired information about tissue bioeffects.  Our Center has an explicit translational focus, which is reflected in the day-to-day operation of TR&D projects as well as in the topics of Collaborative Projects (CPs) and Service Projects (SPs), which are focused on three general areas of high public health impact: cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and neurologic disease.  In keeping with this translational emphasis, CAI2R is also be driven by an embedded collaboration model in which basic scientists, clinicians, and industry developers sit down together regularly at the scanners for interactive technology development and assessment. With early involvement of clinical stakeholders and industry partners, we aim to make CAI2R technologies widely available, for the advancement of biomedical knowledge and for the benefit of patients and the physicians who care for them. Overall Project Narrative  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) develops novel imaging techniques and technologies for the improved diagnosis and management of cancer, musculoskeletal disease, neurological disease and other disorders with a profound impact on human health.

"Multi-Scale 3-D Image Analytics for High Dimensional Spatial Mapping of Normal Tissues PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop open-source software and algorithms for 3-D reconstruc- tion and multi-scale mapping of normal tissues. Another significant goal is to evaluate effects of aging and envi- ronmental factors on molecular and structural architecture of skin. We will leverage our mature (TRL8) technol- ogy for multiplexed 2-D imaging (Cell DIVE™), and our vast experience in 2-D image analytics and machine learning. We have selected normal skin as the organ to develop these tools for several reasons, a) clinical sam- ples from different age groups are more readily available, b) it is a good model to independently capture changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) due to age and normal exposure to environmental factors as well as a variety of pathogenic insults. While the ECM, cellular and intracellular molecular composition varies considerably among various organs, we believe many of the tools developed under this program will be applicable to reconstruct and map other organ models at high (cellular/subcellular) resolution. This proposal will focus on developing algo- rithms and a framework for multi-scale mapping of 3-D tissue images, which will address HuBMAP priorities around quantitative 3-D image analysis/mapping, including automated 3-D image segmentation, feature ex- traction, and image annotation. High-resolution (subcellular) mapping of biomolecules will be implemented us- ing 2-D multiplexed images that are used to reconstruct the 3-D tissue and linked to a lower resolution 3-D opti- cal coherence tomography (OCT) image of the normal tissue. Other cell-level omic data (e.g., RNA FISH) will be mapped in the same way. The low-resolution image is mapped back to a higher-level landmark (e.g., organ) as defined by the HuBMAP common coordinate framework (CCF). As outlined, our proposed technologies will in- clude several key features that are significant and complimentary to existing HuBMAP consortium projects and will advance the state of the art in 3-D tissue analysis. The proposed algorithms will have several key innova- tions that will advance the state of the art in 3-D multiplexed tissue image analysis. First, given the large vol- umes to be analyzed, high throughput will be a key requirement of each image analysis algorithm. This will be supported by our extensive experience in parallelizing single cell analysis pipelines. Second, the proposed algo- rithms will segment the images at multiple scales. The third area of innovation will focus on efficient multi- channel analysis. The proposed project will include creation of an easy-to-use software tool for assembling and visualizing multiscale tissue data called Tissue Atlas Navigation Graphical Overview (TANGO). PROJECT NARRATIVE Composition and organization of cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) they are embedded in, controls the function of different organs in human body. Alterations in any of these can lead to onset and progression of var- ious diseases. The proposed project will develop image analytics algorithms and open source software for high- resolution 3-D mapping of skin, the largest organ in the human body, and evaluate molecular and architectural changes due to aging and UV exposure.",Multi-Scale 3-D Image Analytics for High Dimensional Spatial Mapping of Normal Tissues,10246250,UH3CA246594,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'California', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human BioMolecular Atlas Program', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multiomic Data', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Organ Model', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Skin Aging', 'Skin Tissue', 'Software Tools', 'Solid', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'TimeLine', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age group', 'analysis pipeline', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'high dimensionality', 'image visualization', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging platform', 'innovation', 'member', 'multidimensional data', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'multiplexed imaging', 'multiscale data', 'open source', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'sample collection', 'single cell analysis', 'software development', 'task analysis', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tomography', 'tool']",NCI,GENERAL ELECTRIC GLOBAL RESEARCH CTR,UH3,2020,750000,0.029046416062609104
"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9926311,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,348620,0.0028303100120678926
"q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy Project Summary/Abstract  Ischemic heart disease remains the top cause of death in the world. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) causes regional dysfunction which places remote areas of the heart at a mechanical disadvantage resulting in long term adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and complicating congestive heart failure (CHF). The course of MI and post-MI remodeling is complex and includes vascular and myocellular injury, acute and chronic inflammation, alterations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis. Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease and myocardial injury by imaging the LV at rest and after either exercise or pharmacologically-induced stress to reveal ischemia and/or scar. In our previous effort on this project, we developed quantitative 3D differential deformation measures for stress echocardiography from 4DE-derived LV strain maps taken at rest and after dobutamine stress. These measures can localize and quantify the extent and severity of LV myocardial injury and reveal ischemic regions. We now propose that improved versions of these same measures can be used for both targeting of therapy and outcomes assessment in the treatment of adverse local myocardial remodeling following MI. We choose a particular up and coming therapeutic strategy as an exemplar: the local delivery of injectable hydrogels within the MI region that are intended to alter the biomechanical properties of the LV myocardium, as well as inflammation, and thereby help to minimize adverse remodeling. Our new, robust approach for estimating improved dense displacement and differential deformation measures is based on an innovative data-driven, deep feed-forward, neural network architecture that employs domain adaptation between data from labeled, carefully-constructed synthetic models of physiology and echocardiographic image formation (i.e. with ground truth), and data from unlabeled noisy in vivo porcine or human echocardiography (missing or very limited ground truth). Training is based on tens of thousands of four-dimensional (4D) image-derived patches from these two domains, initially based on displacements derived separately from shape-based processing of conventional B-mode data and block-mode, speckle-tracked processing of raw radio-frequency (RF) data; and later based on learning directly from B-mode and RF image intensity information. After non-rigid registration of rest and stress 4DE image sequences, quantitative 4D differential deformation parameters will be derived from porcine and human echocardiographic test data. These parameters will be derived at baseline, and at several timepoints after delivery of injectable hydrogels into the MI region. The ability of the differential deformation parameters derived from 4D stress echocardiography to guide local delivery of injectable hydrogels in a MI region and assess/predict outcomes will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic porcine model of MI and post-MI remodeling. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility and the relationship to remodeling of our new robust, deep learning-based differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Project Narrative  At the core of the proposed effort is the development and evaluation of novel 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) echocardiographic imaging, image analysis, and machine learning methods that will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation due to stress. Our methods will use this information to guide delivery and assess outcome of a promising new therapy to improve the biomechanical properties of the heart after myocardial injury based on injectable hydrogels.","q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy",9890853,R01HL121226,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dobutamine', 'Echocardiography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Family suidae', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Four-dimensional', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydrogels', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injectable', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Ischemia', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitor', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Property', 'Recombinants', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cohort', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'feedforward neural network', 'heart imaging', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'myocardial injury', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'radio frequency', 'spatiotemporal', 'synthetic construct', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,795348,-0.01619224827452677
"Deep LOGISMOS Abstract: This is a competitive continuation of a project that already yielded the highly flexible, accurate, and broadly applicable LOGISMOS framework for context-aware n-dimensional image segmentation. To substantially improve and extend its capability, we will develop Deep LOGISMOS that combines and reinforces the complementary advantages of LOGISMOS and deep learning (DL). There is growing need for quantitative failure-free 3D and higher-D image analysis for diagnostic and/or planning purposes. Examples of current use exist in radiation oncology, cardiology, ophthalmology and other areas of routine clinical medicine, many of which however still rely on manual slice-by-slice tracing. This manual nature of such analyses hinders their use in precision medicine. Deep LOGISMOS research proposed here will solve this problem and will offer routine efficient analysis of clinical images of analyzable quality. To stimulate a new phase of this research project, we hypothesize that: Advanced graph-based image segmentation algorithms, when combined with deep-learning-derived application/modality specific parameters and allowing highly efficient expert-analyst guidance working in concert with the segmentation algorithms, will significantly increase quantitative analysis performance in routinely acquired, complex, diagnostic-quality medical images across diverse application areas. The proposed research focuses on establishing an image segmentation and analysis framework combining the strengths of LOGISMOS and DL, developing a new way to efficiently generate training data necessary for learning from examples, forming a failure-free strategy for 3D, 4D, and generally n-D quantitative medical image analysis, and discovering ways for automated segmentation quality control. We will fulfill these specific aims:  1. Develop an efficient approach for building large segmentation training datasets in 3D, 4D, n-D  using assisted and suggestive annotations.  2. Develop Deep LOGISMOS, combining two well-established algorithmic strategies – deep learning  and LOGISMOS graph search.  3. Develop and validate methods employing deep learning for quality control of Deep LOGISMOS.  4. In healthcare-relevant applications, demonstrate that Deep LOGISMOS improves segmentation  performance in comparison with state-of-the-art segmentation techniques. Deep LOGISMOS will bring broadly available routine quantification of clinical images, positively impacting the role of reliable image-based information in tomorrow’s precision medicine. Narrative: Previous phases of this successful research project were devoted to the development of new graph-based methods for multi-surface and/or multi-object multi-dimensional biomedical image segmentation. Deep learning is emerging as an important new way to learn from large sets of examples. This proposal will combine deep learning and graph-based image analysis to maximize their combined strengths and overcome their individual weaknesses with the overarching goal to facilitate routine use of quantitative medical image analysis techniques in personalized medical care.",Deep LOGISMOS,10016301,R01EB004640,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Awareness', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fundus photography', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Ophthalmology', 'Organ', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Slice', 'Stroke', 'Suggestion', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Tissue', 'adjudication', 'automated analysis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'diabetic', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'macular edema', 'n-dimensional', 'precision medicine', 'response', 'segmentation algorithm', 'success', 'task analysis', 'treatment planning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2020,396286,0.04839216166419191
"mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment - Phase II 1 Project Summary NIH is increasing its investment in large, multi-center brain MRI studies via projects such as the recently announced BRAIN initiative. The success of these studies depends on the quality of MRIs and the resulting image measurements, regardless of sample size. Even though quality control of MRIs and corresponding measurements could be outsourced, most neuroscience studies rely on in-house procedures that combine automatically generated scores with manually guided checks, such as visual inspection. Implementing these procedures typically requires combining several software systems. For example, the NIH NIAAA- and BD2K- funded Data Analysis Resource (DAR) of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) uses XNAT to consolidate the structural, diffusion, and functional MRIs acquired across five sites, and has also developed their own custom software package to comply with study requirements for a multi-tier, quality control (QC) workflow. However, these custom, one-off tools lack support for the multi-site QC workflows that will come with the unified platform that MIQA represents: a design that supports collaboration and sharing, and strong cohesion between technologies. To improve the effectiveness of QC efforts specific to multi-center neuroimaging studies, we will develop a widely accessible and broadly compatible software platform that simplifies the creation of custom QC workflows in compliance with study requirements, provides core functionality for performing QC of medical images, and automatically generates documentation compliant with the FAIR principle, i.e., making scientific results findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.  Specifically, our multi-site, web-based software platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (MIQA) will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by leveraging open-source, state-of-the-art web interface technologies, such as a web-based dataset caching system and machine learning to aid in QC processes. Users will be able to configure workflows that not only reflect the specific requirements of medical imaging studies but also minimize the time spent on labor-intensive operations, such as visually reviewing scans. Issue tracking technology will enhance communication between geographically-distributed team members, as they can easily share image annotations and receive automated notifications of outstanding QC issues. The system will be easy to deploy as it will be able to interface with various imaging storage backends, such as local file systems and XNAT. While parts of this functionality have been developed elsewhere, MIQA is unique as it provides a unified, standard interface for efficient QC setup, maintenance, and review for projects analyzing multiple, independently managed data sources.  The usefulness of this unique QC system will be demonstrated on increasing the efficiency of the diverse QC team of the multi-center NCANDA study. Narrative The goal of this proposal is to develop a web-based, multi-site, open-source platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (MIQA) to address the QC needs of geographically diverse teams using small and large medical image-based studies alike. MIQA will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by levering state-of-the-art machine learning, data management, and web interface technologies. Our effort will minimize the time spent on labor-intensive reviews and analysis operations by supporting team-oriented reviewing that is guided by highly customizable workflows seamlessly interacting with existing data management systems.",mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment - Phase II,10010814,R44MH119022,"['3-Dimensional', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Alcohols', 'Archives', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Provenance', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'FAIR principles', 'Four-dimensional', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Iowa', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurosciences', 'Notification', 'Online Systems', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'Writing', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'cohesion', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dexterity', 'image archival system', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'open source', 'operation', 'quality assurance', 'research study', 'software systems', 'success', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'web interface']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R44,2020,819293,0.025080518238896395
"Next-Generation Ultrasound Localization Microscopy Project Summary/Abstract Abnormal alterations of tissue microcirculation are often associated with early stage of tissue pathology. Detection and characterization of these early microvascular abnormalities can greatly benefit clinical diagnosis and treatment monitoring as well as facilitating the creation of new therapies to counter disease development. For decades, there has been a longstanding quest for the development of a clinical imaging modality that can noninvasively and directly image such tissue microvascular variations. To date, however, such an imaging method remains elusive due to the fundamental compromise between imaging spatial resolution and depth penetration. Therefore, the long-term objective of this project is to fulfill this unmet clinical need by developing the next-generation ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM), which is an ultrasound-based imaging technique that can directly assess structural and functional tissue microvasculature in vivo in humans at a clinically relevant depth. Different from other imaging modalities, ULM is not limited by the resolution-penetration compromise: ULM can noninvasively image capillary-scale microvessels at several centimeters depth and quantitatively measure their blood flow speed (as low as 1 mm/s). Such combination of deep imaging penetration and exquisite spatial resolution and the unique functionality of measuring small vessel blood flow speed make ULM a promising technique for many clinical applications including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. At present, however, ULM is not ready for clinical use due to several key technical limitations: 1) ULM data acquisition is very slow (tens of seconds with breath holding); 2) ULM post-processing is very expensive computationally (several hours to generate a single 2D ULM image); 3) ULM is difficult to be extended to 3D imaging (which is important for comprehensive evaluation of tissue microvasculature such as in cancer applications). These limitations largely forbids ULM from being effectively used in the clinic to provide useful microvascular biomarkers. In this proposal, we will concentrate on addressing these technical barriers and transform ULM to a truly useful clinical imaging tool. Our approach synergistically combines deep learning (DL), parallel computing, and ultrafast 3D ultrasound imaging to fundamentally shorten ULM data acquisition time, substantially accelerate ULM post-processing, and enhance ULM to 3D imaging. Our first aim will develop and validate DL-based ULM data processing algorithms that would enable real-time 4D morphometric ULM and fast 3D quantitative ULM. Our method uniquely collects real labeled optical imaging data on a chicken embryo microvessel model for DL training. Our second aim will focus on realizing 3D-ULM on a 2D row-column-addressing transducer with ultrafast 3D plane wave imaging. We will develop a DL-based beamforming technique to enable high-fidelity 3D microbubble imaging for robust 3D-ULM. Our final aim will focus on validating the in vivo performance of the newly developed 3D-ULM imaging techniques on a mouse tumor model. We will be collaborating with world-renowned experts in deep learning, optical imaging, and comparative medicine at the University of Illinois to accomplish these aims of the proposal. Project Narrative Imaging-based detection and characterization of abnormal tissue microvascular variations is clinically significant for diagnosis, treatment evaluation, and therapy development in many pathologies such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases. At present, there is no viable noninvasive imaging tool that can fulfill this important clinical need. To fill this gap, we propose to develop a new ultrasound-based super-resolution microvessel imaging technique that can directly and quantitatively assess the structure and the function of tissue microcirculation in vivo in humans.",Next-Generation Ultrasound Localization Microscopy,10039725,R21EB030072,"['3-Dimensional', '3D ultrasound', '4T1', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Carcinoma', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chickens', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incentives', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbubbles', 'Microcirculation', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nutrient', 'Organ', 'Oxygen', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Transportation', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'microCT', 'microscopic imaging', 'next generation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optical imaging', 'parallel computer', 'performance tests', 'quantitative ultrasound', 'real-time images', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tumor', 'two photon microscopy']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,565346,0.014365854175607269
"Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning Abstract In 2015, 1,658,370 new cancer cases are estimated to occur in the US, where nearly two-thirds will have radiation therapy (RT). Given that there are over 2,300 RT centers in the US, and current systems for contouring organs at risk (OARs) rely mostly on manual methods, there is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour OARs in medical images at a high degree of automation and for impacting current practice of RT planning. Encouraged by our strong Phase I results in thoracic and head and neck (H&N) body regions compared to current industry systems, we seek the accuracy, efficiency, and clinical acceptance of the contours output by our software product to significantly exceed those of existing systems. Our overall aim for Phase II is to advance the algorithms and prototype software developed in Phase I into a leading commercial software product, and demonstrate its efficacy in multiple medical centers across the country with diverse populations. Phase II specific aims are three-fold: (1) Further advance the automatic anatomy recognition algorithms from Phase I using advanced deep learning techniques. (2) Develop a cloud-based software auto contouring service. (3) Perform clinical evaluation of the new software on H&N and thoracic cases. Aim 1 will be accomplished in three stages: (a) Automating the process of defining the body region on given patient CT studies, which is currently done manually in our system, via a new concept of virtual landmarks using deep learning techniques. (b) Improving object recognition/ localization accuracy from the current 2 voxels for “good” quality data sets to 1 voxel and from 4-5 voxels for “poor” quality data sets to 2-3 voxels by using virtual landmarks to learn object relationships. (c) Improving object delineation by combining object localization methods with deep learning techniques applied to the vicinity of the localized objects to bring boundary distance accuracy within 1 voxel. Aim 2 will be achieved by developing a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service model to implement the software that incorporates the algorithms. To accomplish Aim 3, an evaluation study involving four academic RT centers will be undertaken to assess the efficiency, accuracy, and acceptability of the contours output by the new software. To assess efficiency, contouring time taken by the current clinical process will be compared to the time taken by the new software method plus any manual adjustment needed. Accuracy will be assessed by comparing software output to carefully prepared ground truth contours. Acceptability will be determined by conducting a blinded reader study, where an acceptability score (1-5) is given by radiation oncologists to software produced contours, ground truth contours, and contours produced by the normal clinical process, and comparing these scores. Expected clinical outcomes are significantly improved clinical efficiency/ acceptability of contouring compared to current practice. There is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour organs at risk in medical images at a high degree of automation for impacting current practice of radiation therapy planning. Encouraged by strong competitive results from the Phase I part of this project, in this grant, further technical advances and a cloud-based software service are proposed. A multicenter clinical evaluation of the new product is also planned to assess the clinical efficacy of the system.",Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning,10241562,R42CA199735,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Blinded', 'Body Regions', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Grant', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health Personnel', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thorax', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Object Attachment', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Service delivery model', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical efficacy', 'cloud based', 'deep learning', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'neural network', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'software as a service', 'software development', 'software systems', 'treatment center', 'treatment planning', 'virtual']",NCI,"QUANTITATIVE RADIOLOGY SOLUTIONS, LLC",R42,2020,2500,0.01929432591451168
"Fast motion-robust fetal neuroimaging with MRI PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an invaluable tool for studying the early development of the brain and can resolve diagnostic ambiguities that may remain after routine ultrasound exams. Unfortunately, high levels of fetal and maternal motion (1) limit fetal MRI to rapid two-dimensional (2D) sequences and frequently introduce dramatic artifacts such as (2) image misorientation relative to the standard sagittal, coronal, axial planes needed for clinical assessment and (3) partial to complete signal loss. These factors lead to the inefficient practice of repeating ~30 s stack-of-slices acquisitions until motion-free images have been obtained. Throughout the session, technologists manually adjust the orientation of scans in response to motion, and about 38% of datasets are typically discarded. Thus, subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of MRI for answering clinical and investigational questions in the fetus. The overarching goal of this project is to overcome the challenges posed by motion by exploiting innovations in deep learning, which have enabled image-analysis algorithms with unprecedented speed and reliability. We propose to integrate these into the MRI acquisition pipeline to unlock the potential of fetal MRI. We will develop practical pulse-sequence technology for automated and dynamically motion-corrected fetal neuroimaging without the need for external hardware or calibration. We hypothesize that this will radically improve the quality and success rates of clinical and research studies, while dramatically reducing patient discomfort and cost. We propose as Aim 1 to eradicate (2) the vulnerability of acquisitions to image-brain misorientation with rapid, automated prescription of standard anatomical planes. In Aim 2, we propose to address (3) motion during the scan with real-time correction of fetal-head motion. An anatomical stack-of-slices acquisition will be interleaved with volumetric navigators. These will be used to measure motion as it happens in the scanner and to adaptively update the slice tilt/position. We propose as Aim 3 to develop a 3D radial sequence and estimate motion between subsets of radial spokes for real-time self-navigation. Adaptively updating the orientation of spokes and selectively re-acquiring corrupted subsets at the end of the scan will enable 3D imaging of the fetal brain (1). Since the applicant has a physics background, the proposed training program at MIT and HMS will focus on deep learning and fetal development/neuroscience during the K99 phase to develop the skills needed for transitioning to independence in the R00 phase. The applicant’s goal is to become a fetal image acquisition and analysis scientist acting as bridge between deep learning, MRI and clinical fetal-imaging applications to shift the boundaries of what is currently possible with state-of-the-art technology. Fulfilling the research aims will promote this, as it will result in a practical framework for automation and motion correction, applicable to a wide variety of fetal neuroimaging sequences. PROJECT NARRATIVE Subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging, as it frequently produces images with dramatic artifacts. The goal of this project is to exploit innovations in deep learning and integrate them into the acquisition pipeline to overcome the challenges posed by motion in fetal neuroimaging studies. This will be achieved by using fast, automated scan prescription of standard anatomical planes and by adaptively updating the acquisition as motion happens in the scanner, based on sub-second navigator scans interleaved with the imaging sequence.",Fast motion-robust fetal neuroimaging with MRI,9950474,K99HD101553,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Calibration', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radial', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'echo detection', 'experience', 'fetal', 'image archival system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'repaired', 'research study', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NICHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2020,108601,0.00856859698426845
"Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction Nuclear medicine imaging in children has been shown to have significant clinical value across all organ systems. In providing this significant benefit it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that of adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. The governing principle of this project will be to minimize radiation dose while methodically ensuring that lesion detection performance is fully preserved. This will be accomplished by using validations based on both numerical and physician observers measuring performance in tasks that emulate those performed clinically. We will employ two approaches in tandem to enable lowering dose while maintaining performance. First, we will use advanced image reconstruction and processing techniques. Corrections for various forms of image quality degradation will be incorporated in the reconstruction, and deep learning (DL) will be used for post-reconstruction denoising. Second, we will develop methods to correct for both body and respiratory motion, which degrade diagnostic accuracy. Correcting for body and respiratory motion will allow dose to be reduced without loss of image quality and will also offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to minimize motion when imaging children. For this investigation we have selected 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal imaging as a testbed to demonstrate our approaches. Damage to the renal cortex resulting from infection of the kidneys is a critical issue in children, including newborns and toddlers. DMSA SPECT is the “gold-standard” in the evaluation of pyelonephritis and renal scarring post- infection. The concepts we will demonstrate for reduction of radiation dose and correction of motion with DMSA will be translatable to other SPECT (and PET) studies in pediatric imaging and beyond.  Our Specific Aims are: 1. Establish infrastructure for investigating and evaluating advanced reconstruction and motion correction; 2. Determine the extent of radiation dose reduction to pediatric patients through improved reconstruction and DL denoising while maintaining optimal full-dose lesion detection accuracy; 3. Develop data-driven and depth-sensing camera methods for body and respiratory motion estimation and correction; and 4. Conduct numerical and physician observer studies to validate the level of dose reduction enabled by DL denoising and motion correction. Narrative  In nuclear medicine imaging, it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that in adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. Correcting for body and respiratory motion occurring during imaging will improve the quality of the formed three-dimensional images of the patient by reducing blurring and image artifacts and offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to reduce motion when imaging children, which can bear health risks of its own. We propose an advanced reconstruction methodology which would enable reduction in the amount of activity administered and compensate for patient motion during imaging.",Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction,9914572,R01EB029315,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'DMSA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Freedom', 'Gaussian model', 'General Anesthesia', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Newborn Infant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Pyelonephritis', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Sedation procedure', 'Societies', 'Statistical Study', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toddler', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney infection', 'molecular imaging', 'pediatric patients', 'preservation', 'reconstruction', 'renal scarring', 'respiratory', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,773763,0.02622392856333503
"Streamlining Volumetric Imaging, Analysis and Publication Using Immersive Virtual Reality Over the past 15 years, new imaging technologies and methods for high throughput imaging have revolutionized structural biology by extending the resolution and scale of collected images in 3 dimensions. The resulting image volumes are more typically hundreds of GB to even tens of TB and in some cases approach PB sizes. These file sizes pose challenges for image acquisition, image analysis, and communication of a representative set of raw data and quantification. Image acquisition runs can be lengthy and expensive, and often errors are not identified until after the completion of scanning. Large files contain many structures, and require machine learning (ML) strategies in a context that permits error correction. Scientific communication requires tools for ready access to raw data, and more efficient methods to communicate the rapidly accumulating sets of scientific information. We propose to leverage virtual reality (VR) and verbal communication within the VR environment, to streamline each of these stages of scientific work, by capitalizing on the more natural abilities for stereoscopic vision and hearing to process scenes and language. Based upon the tool base and direct volume rendering of large files that we have established in our VR software, called syGlass, we will first integrate VR into the microscope controls for tuning the microscope and then efficiently inspecting images in 3D as they are acquired (Aim 1). Next, we will introduce novel domain adaptation techniques in the ML field to scale up 3D image quantification capabilities for current acquisition sizes, by coupling them with user-optimized experiences that do not require ML expertise, and yet provide automated and accurate results (Aim 2). Finally, we will provide tools to efficiently generate narrated scientific presentations in VR for use in the lab setting, as manuscript publications, and for production of educational materials (Aim 3). In each of these activities, we will introduce paradigm shifts in the management of experiments, analysis of the resulting data, and publication of manuscripts and materials to other scientists and the general public. The goal of this project is to speed the pipeline from image acquisition to communication of analyzed data for large image files (big data). We propose to leverage virtual reality to change the way users interact with their microscope, provide new methods for more accurate quantification and make scientific data more transparent, and more accessible to specialists and the general public. These new paradigms are applicable to basic, pre-clinical and clinical research, and serve the goals of big data projects to generate more reliable and encompassing scientific conclusions.","Streamlining Volumetric Imaging, Analysis and Publication Using Immersive Virtual Reality",10011054,R44MH125238,"['3-Dimensional', '3D virtual reality', '4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Depth Perception', 'Educational Materials', 'Foundations', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Information Distribution', 'Ingestion', 'Instruction', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Lasers', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Resort', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'adaptation algorithm', 'base', 'data dissemination', 'data exploration', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feature detection', 'field study', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'movie', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical research', 'scale up', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'tool', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment']",NIMH,ISTOVISR,R44,2020,1159612,0.030649934427064384
"Accelerating Community-Driven Medical Innovation with VTK Abstract Thousands of medical researchers around the world use VTK —the Visualization Toolkit— an open-source, freely available software development toolkit providing advanced 3D interactive visualization, image processing and data analysis algorithms. They either use VTK directly in their in-house research applications or indirectly via one of the multitude of medical image analysis and bioinformatics applications that is built using VTK: Osirix, 3D Slicer, BioImageXD, MedINRIA, SCIRun, ParaView, and others. Furthermore, VTK also provides 3D visualizations for clinical applications such as BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system and Zimmer’s prosthesis design and evaluation platform. VTK has been downloaded many hundreds of thousands of times since its initial release in 1993. Considering its broad distribution and prevalent use, it can be argued that VTK has had a greater impact on medical research, and patient care, than any other open-source visualization package.  This proposal is in response to the multitude of requests we have been receiving from the VTK medical community. The aims are as follows:  1. Aim 1: Adaptive visualization framework: Produce an integrated framework that supports  visualization applications that balance server-side and client-side processing depending on data size,  analysis requirements, and the user platform (e.g., phone, tablet, or GPU-enabled desktop).  2. Aim 2: Integrated, interactive applications: Extend VTK to support a diversity of programming  paradigms ranging from C++ to JavaScript to Python and associated tools such as Jupyter Notebooks,  integrating with emerging technologies such as deep learning technologies.  3. Aim 3: Advanced rendering, including AR/VR: Target shader-based rendering systems and AR/VR  libraries that achieve high frame rates with minimal latency for ubiquitous applications that combine  low-cost, portable devices such as phones, ultrasound transducers, and other biometric sensors for  visually monitoring, guiding, and delivering advanced healthcare.  4. Aim 4: Infrastructure, Outreach, and Validation: Engage the VTK community and the proposed  External Advisory Board during the creation and assessment of the proposed work and corresponding  modern, digital documentation in the form of videos and interactive web-based content. Project Narrative The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open source, freely available software library for the interactive display and processing of medical images. It is being used in most major medical imaging research applications, e.g., 3D Slicer and Osirix, and in several commercial medical applications, e.g., BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system. VTK development began in 1993 and since then an extensive community of users and developers has grown around it. However, the rapid advancement of cloud computing, GPU hardware, deep learning algorithms, and VR/AR systems require corresponding advances in VTK so that the research and products that depend on VTK continue to deliver leading edge healthcare technologies.

"ClearScope Combined in vivo and ex vivo three-dimensional (3D) whole-brain imaging of non-transgenic and transgenic animal models holds the promise of novel insights into neural network connectivity patterns. With regard to ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole-brain datasets, the best approach is brain clearing followed by whole-brain light sheet microscopy (LSM) because of its unique combination of speed, 3D resolving power, and low phototoxicity compared to confocal and multiphoton microscopy. Unlike other methods, the combined brain clearing / LSM approach makes it possible to use intact tissue and retain all intracellular connections within the brain structure. However, LSM systems commercially available are not suitable for ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole-brain datasets in advanced connectomics research. Recently, Dr. Raju Tomer (Dept. Biol. Sci., Columbia Univ., New York, NY) developed light sheet theta microscopy (LSTM), essentially a unique arrangement of two light sheets oblique to the specimen and one detection objective perpendicular to the specimen. This novel microscope is the basis for a number of capabilities in LSTM that are not all available with any other commercially available LSM systems. The LSTM technology has distinct advantages over confocal and other light sheet microscopes, including the unmatched ability to image thicker tissue specimens over a larger lateral area (XY) at higher optical resolutions, while maintaining fast imaging speed, high imaging quality, and low photo-bleaching. This promising technology serves as the basis for this Lab to Marketplace proposal to develop the ClearScope™, which refines and improves Dr. Tomer's original LSTM system to create a successful commercial microscope for wide-spread adoption. The key technical objectives for developing the ClearScope as a commercial product include creating and testing (i) a ClearScope prototype based on an optimized microscope hardware design; (ii) novel microscope hardware components for the ClearScope, comprising a novel chamber that contains the investigated specimen and the immersion medium, and a novel detection objective changer; (iii) novel control and image acquisition software for the ClearScope; and importantly, (iv) novel software that surpasses the existing state-of-the-art technology to assemble acquired image stacks into large 3D image volumes exceeding 10TB without need to downsample the image information. The production version of the ClearScope will benefit the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general by improving understanding of neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. In particular, this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases. The proposed project will enable important new research, that is not currently feasible, into whole-brain neural network connectivity patterns by means of ex vivo light microscopic imaging of three-dimensional whole-brain datasets. To achieve this, the proposed project will create the ClearScope light sheet microscope featuring signficant capabilities to image thick specimens of unlimited lateral (XY) size with resolution that permits investigatons of subcellular structures to distinguish adjacent neuronal processes (axons, dendrites, varicosities and dendritic spines). Because these features are not all available with any commercially available light sheet microscopes, the benefit for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be the possibility to better understand neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions, ultimately resulting in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases.",ClearScope,10019728,R44MH116827,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion', 'Lateral', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'New York', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Phototoxicity', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rattus', 'Refractive Indices', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Varicosity', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'ex vivo imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R44,2020,1313060,-0.0026427563021485584
"Development of advanced cardiac SPECT imaging technologies Project Abstract Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) continues to play a critical role in the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease (CAD). While conventional SPECT scanners using parallel-hole collimators are still the foundation of cardiac SPECT, recently our field observed an exciting growth of new developments of dedicated cardiac scanners. Such dedicated scanners, such as the GE Alcyone 530/570c systems and the D-SPECT systems both with CZT detectors, typically have multiple detectors collecting photons emitted from the heart simultaneously, leading to dramatically improved sensitivity (2-5 X). In addition, the GE systems use pinhole collimators and can achieve much higher resolution. These dedicated scanners opened doors to new applications with significant clinical impact, including ultra-low-dose imaging, absolute quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), high resolution molecular imaging, multi-isotope imaging, motion correction, and many more. Most of these new applications are uniquely achievable only using dedicated scanners. While the dedicated cardiac SPECT systems can improve clinical practice and lead to numerous new clinical applications, such systems are far from being optimized to fully realize their great potentials. In this grant, we propose to systematically develop and optimize innovative imaging technologies for the GE 530/570c systems to further improve its clinical efficacy in a variety of significant ways. In Aim 1, we will develop and optimize methods for static cardiac SPECT imaging. We will develop various deep learning methods and investigate approaches to increase angular sampling to reduce noise, and improve resolution and quantitative accuracy. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate methods for dynamic SPECT imaging, particularly involving direct parametric image reconstruction. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate methods for dual-isotope SPECT.

"SCH:Smartphone Wound Image Parameter Analysis and Decision Support in Mobile Env PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Chronic wounds affect 6.5 million patients in the U.S., with an estimated treatment cost of $25 billion. Our team proposes research to advance our existing NSF-funded smartphone wound analysis system, which helps patients monitor their diabetic foot ulcers, providing them with instant feedback on healing progress. Our wound system analyzes a smartphone image of the patients' wound, detects the wound area and tissue composition, and generates a proprietary healing score by comparing the current image with a past image. Our envisioned chronic wound assessment system will support evidence-based decisions by the care team while visiting patients, and move wound care toward digital objectivity. We define digital objectivity as the synthesis of wound assessment metrics that are extracted autonomously from images in order to generate objective actionable feedback, enabling clinicians not trained as wound specialists to deliver ""standardized wound care"". Digital objectivity contrasts with the current practice of subjective, visual inspection of wounds based on physician experience. The first aim will develop image processing algorithms to mitigate wound analysis errors caused by non-ideal lighting in some clinical or home settings, and when the wound is photographed from arbitrary camera angles and distance. While our previous wound system worked well in ideal conditions, non-ideal lighting caused large errors and healthy skin was detected as the wound area in extreme cases. The second aim extends our existing wound analysis system that targets only diabetic wounds to handle arterial, venous and pressure ulcers, expanding the potential user. The third aim will synthesize algorithms that autonomously generate actionable wound decision rules that are learned from decisions taken by actual wound clinicians. This research is joint work of Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) (technical expertise in image processing, machine learning and smartphone programming) and University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) (clinical expertise on wounds, and wound patient recruitment to validate our work) RELEVANCE (See instructions): We propose research to advance our existing smartphone wound analysis system, which detects the wound area and tissue composition, and generates a proprietary healing score from a wound image.

"Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB) Project Summary Each major human disease is associated with a specific range of morphological changes to cells and tissues in the micron scale. Normal and abnormal structure was discovered and is still characterized using histology - a microscopic technique that depends on physical tissue slices. Presently, histology’s use in systems biology is limited by its largely descriptive and two-dimensional nature. Making histology quantitative and three-dimensional would be potentially transformational for research and diagnostics, but has been impractical. Accordingly, we have now created a 3D form of histology by customizing X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) of fixed and stained, millimeter-scale, whole organisms and tissue samples. We used fixed and metal-stained, whole zebrafish because they contain a full range of tissues within the size range currently studied histologically. The result is the first practical way to create virtual histology-like “sections” in any plane. Three-dimensional, complete histological phenotyping has potential use in genetic and chemical screens, and in clinical and toxicological tissue diagnostics. Here, we propose the next steps needed to enable high-throughput, quantitative, 3D histological phenotyping of whole, millimeter-scale animals. The proposed work applies the principles of chemistry, physics, and computer science to improve image resolution, throughput, and analytics, organized into three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will build on our developments in this project and further improve imaging volume and resolution by upgrading imaging array, optics, and sub-pixel shifting, and to throughput by changes in sample embedding, loading geometry and mechanics, helical CT scanning, scintillator material, and to data sharing by improvements to the ViewTool infrastructure and user interface. Specific Aim 2 will yield reference images to define the range of normal phenotypic variation and to obtain samples related to a range of potential applications. Specific Aim 3 will apply the power of machine learning to segmentation, annotation, and analytics. Together, this work will establish a practical foundation for large-scale genetic and chemical screens involving mm-scale, whole organisms based on 3-dimensional, quantitative, histological phenotyping. The instrumentation and analytics will be state-of-the-art in its combination of resolution, field-of-view, pancellularity, image quality, analytical potential, throughput, sample stability, and reproducibility and largely usable with both tube and synchrotron X-ray sources. The voxel resolution will be at least 0.5 μm across fields-of-view of up to 1 cm. Representation of every cell type make the images suitable for cross-referencing across imaging modalities. Potential applications will be explored, “wild-type” will begin to be defined, and training sets for automated segmentation generated. The potential impact will encompass the missions of most NIH Institutes and Centers. The whole-animal genetic and chemical screens enabled are expected to impact drug development, diagnostics, and our basic understanding of how genes and environment define phenotype. Project Narrative Our group has established the only three-dimensional form of histology that is suitable for histopathology and quantitative tissue phenotyping, tissue X-ray microtomography (micro-CT). We outline here a plan to establish mechanisms for increasing resolution and field-of-view, to add sample multiplexing, to simply sample preparation, and to explore machine learning mechanisms for defining normal and abnormal structure towards whole-organism complete tissue phenotyping. The resulting tools will allow the community to comprehensively and computationally determine the roles of genes and environment in defining phenotype, which has implications in drug development, biomedical research, and medicine.",Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB),9991958,R24OD018559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Animal Genetics', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body measure procedure', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cesium', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Iodides', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Metals', 'Microscopic', 'Mission', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nerve', 'Normal Range', 'Online Systems', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Preparation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Spiral Computed Tomography', 'Stains', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Tube', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'Zebrafish', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'clinical toxicology', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'crowdsourcing', 'data dissemination', 'data sharing', 'detector', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'feature detection', 'histological studies', 'human disease', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'microCT', 'millimeter', 'mutant', 'programs', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'virtual']",OD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R24,2020,655482,0.010499127842013359
"A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue Project Summary Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) uses secondary ion mass spectrometry and metal conjugated primary antibodies to simultaneously visualize dozens of proteins at subcellular resolution in a single tissue section. This technology is back compatible with archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) and has been used in peer-reviewed work to simultaneously visualize and quantify 36 proteins in retrospective human tissue cohorts. In line with the stated goals of the HuBMAP consortium to develop both “High-sensitivity, high-resolution imaging techniques that can rapidly provide spectral data over large areas of tissue” and “Quantitative imaging analysis tools, including automated 3D image segmentation, feature extraction, and image annotation,” the work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease. To achieve this, we will validate 100 FFPE antibodies and optimize ready-to-use multiplexed staining panels in lyophilized format that will permit storage for at least two years. Protocols and reagents for multiplexed signal amplification of protein and mRNA targets will be further refined, while next generation instrumentation will increase sample throughput to permit full tissue section imaging of up to 40 proteins in 1 hour. Standardized reagents and more robust instrumentation will be accompanied by an automated computational pipeline that utilizes a standard set of segmentation markers and machine learning to accurately identify nuclei and cell borders in any non-neural human tissue. This data will be used to cluster single cell events into functionally distinct populations according to morphology, protein expression, and histological distribution. The reagents and computational pipeline proposed here synergize with existing HuBMAP-funded platforms and could be readily generalized to virtually any high dimensional imaging modality. Thus, this work will not only provide a practical, back compatible imaging platform for high throughput multiplexed imaging, but will also accelerate development of other complimentary imaging technologies as well. Project Narrative Multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) is a new technology for visualizing dozens of proteins in standard clinical tissue biopsies at high resolution. The work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease.","A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue",10231018,UH3CA246633,"['Allergic', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decidua', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Extramural Activities', 'Feedback', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Freeze Drying', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Granuloma', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histologic', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human BioMolecular Atlas Program', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Ions', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metals', 'Morphology', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathology', 'Peer Review', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Readiness', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'graphical user interface', 'high dimensionality', 'high resolution imaging', 'human imaging', 'human tissue', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'ion source', 'machine learning method', 'multiplexed imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'protein expression', 'quantitative imaging', 'reagent standardization', 'technology validation', 'tool', 'tumor microenvironment', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,UH3,2020,700000,-0.021498617221259234
"Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients ABSTRACT The prevalence of obesity in the United States has risen to record levels over the past 40 years, putting strain on the healthcare system and creating difficult challenges for medical imaging. We propose to overcome the challenges that obesity poses to ultrasound imaging by (1) developing novel image-quality improvement techniques, and (2) implementing them on pulse-echo ultrasound imaging systems to yield high-quality images of the liver. Ultrasound imaging is uniquely affected by the presence of additional connective tissue and thick subcutaneous fat layers in overweight and obese patients; these additional subcutaneous layers greatly exacerbate reverberation and phase-aberration of the acoustic wave, leading to high levels of clutter, degraded resolution, and overall poor-quality ultrasound images. Our proposed methods will determine the local speed-of-sound in abdominal tissue layers and use this information to accomplish distributed phase-aberration correction. We also apply machine learning techniques to model and suppress the effects of reverberation clutter and speckle noise. The combination of these techniques is expected to achieve significant improvements in liver image quality. These image-quality improvement methods will be implemented on a real-time ultrasound scanner and will be evaluated in clinical imaging tasks of overweight and obese patients undergoing ultrasound surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma. Successful development of the proposed technology will not only enable high-quality ultrasound imaging of the liver in otherwise difficult-to-image overweight and obese patients, but also facilitate improved image quality across nearly all ultrasound imaging applications, for all populations. NARRATIVE This proposal aims to develop and test several new techniques to overcome the current limitations of ultrasound to make high-quality images in overweight and obese individuals. These novel ultrasound techniques will be initially applied to improve liver imaging in overweight and obese patients in a pilot study, though the benefits of this new high-quality imaging technology will extend to all other areas of clinical ultrasound imaging.",Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients,9885175,R01EB027100,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiac', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Weight', 'clinical imaging', 'elastography', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'liver imaging', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prototype', 'radio frequency', 'simulation', 'sound', 'subcutaneous']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,590183,0.03071208801037503
"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"Opera Phenix High-Content Imaging System for Drug Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY The University of Pittsburgh Drug Discovery Institute (UPDDI) is requesting funds to purchase the Perkin Elmer OPERA PHENIX high speed, high resolution spinning disk confocal High-Content Screening (HCS) device. The Opera Phenix will replace two Molecular Devices ImageXpress Ultra high content readers purchased in 2008, which are critical to multiple NIH-, DoD-, and Foundation-funded projects at the University of Pittsburgh, but are no longer supported by the manufacturer and have been decommissioned. We have determined that one Opera Phenix instrument can replace the two IXUs. The Phenix is a third generation HCS instrument that will be essential to satisfy the diverse needs of users that the UPDDI serves. No comparable instruments exist at the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and Carnegie Mellon University. Over the last decade, HCS has become a standard in the pharmaceutical industry for target identification, phenotypic screening, as well as toxicology, and in academia for large-scale biological studies, where cell-by- cell quantitation is critical. The UPDDI has been an academic pioneer in the application of HCS and serves an extensive number of collaborators across campus that require and rely on HCS, ranging from neurodegeneration, organ regeneration, cancer, liver diseases, organotypic model development, and traumatic brain injury. Our diverse user groups’ needs emphasize discovery models of physiological relevance and high complexity, and therefore require fast, high resolution 2D, 3D, and kinetic imaging and maximum flexibility in image analysis. The large number of HCS users working in the UPDDI further demands a fast system to permit effective sharing of instrument time, and an integrated database with off-site user access to perform off- line analysis. Key requirements for an HCS imager therefore are superior speed in acquiring z-series of images at high resolution of thick specimens in aqueous matrices, mature yet flexible image algorithms, and seamless integration of instrument software with system, public,and custom-developed UPDDI databases. The only instrument that meets all of these criteria is the Opera Phenix because it has 1) fast laser-based illumination and the ability to acquire multiple channels simultaneously 2) water immersion objectives that eliminate non-matching refractive indices, which limit spherical aberrations of air and oil objectives at longer working distances and require adjustment of correction collars depending on imaging depth; 3) a powerful suite of user-friendly yet flexible image analysis routines including a 3D module, advanced texture and morphology analysis, and intuitive and user-friendly machine learning; and 4) the ability to perform seamless “adaptive high-resolution imaging”, i.e., pre-scanning a large area at low magnification, followed by automated “on-the- fly” switching to higher magnification to acquire high resolution images of user-defined regions of interest. The Opera Phenix is the only instrument on the market that is capable of fulfilling the demands of the University of Pittsburgh’s diverse drug discovery community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Modern drug discovery increasingly demands better and more disease relevant models and the ability to analyze them. High-content screening (HCS) has become indispensable in the analysis of such models as it permits the analysis of cells, their constituents, and interactions in their proper biological context. The third generation HCS instrument, Opera Phenix, produces the quality and quantity of data from cells, tissues and experimental animals that are required for computational and systems biological investigations, while at the same time providing the throughput needed for automated screening.",Opera Phenix High-Content Imaging System for Drug Discovery,9935240,S10OD028450,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academia', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Drug Industry', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immersion', 'Institutes', 'Intuition', 'Kinetics', 'Lasers', 'Lighting', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical center', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oils', 'Phenotype', 'Reader', 'Refractive Indices', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Texture', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Water', 'aqueous', 'base', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'high resolution imaging', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'organ regeneration', 'physiologic model', 'screening', 'user-friendly']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,S10,2020,1010594,-0.00021933536794480952
"High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging The cornea is the primary focusing structure of our visual system. Infections and diseases in the tissue can impair vision and lead to blindness, even in eyes with intact neurosensory function. Corneal disease is one of the leading causes of visual deficiency and blindness in the world. Tissue evaluation is an important step for assessing the health of the donor cornea and its appropriateness for different types of placement, yet this process suffers from high subjectivity. High-definition corneal imaging is needed to assist in selection of the most appropriate tissue for transplant. Progress on this front would greatly serve public need, as the cornea is the most commonly transplanted tissue worldwide, with nearly 185,000 transplants annually. Thus, a more sensitive and quantitative method for objective evaluation of tissue at eye banks is needed. We have developed a 3D high-definition imaging instrument based on Gabor-Domain Optical Coherence Microscopy (GDOCM). Our SBIR Phase I research successfully accomplished all Aims and demonstrated the feasibility of quantitative assessment of corneal tissue over a large field of view with GDOCM. Our Phase I results demonstrated that GDOCM has the following key advantages over existing corneal imaging techniques, which include specular and confocal microscopy: 1) improved accuracy of tissue qualification with 4-10x increase in field of view that reduces sampling error – this will provides a truer assessment of the overall tissue characteristics; 2) ability to simultaneously measure corneal thickness, quantify endothelial cell density, and identify morphological variations due to corneal disease – this will lead to complete corneal evaluation in a single instrument; 3) leveraging machine learning innovations to minimize variability induced by users – this will result in a more objective evaluation; 4) enhanced 3D cellular-level imaging of thin translucent endothelial cells – this will enable a detailed understanding of cell viability. The results of the proposed Phase studies II will demonstrate that GDOCM can provide high-definition, 3D visualization of corneal structures with immediate commercial application for qualification of donor tissue in eye banks, and with a path to in vivo clinical imaging of patients with corneal disease. Current corneal evaluation methods employed at eye banks have limited field of view and/or insufficient resolution, and their results suffer from high subjectivity.

We propose to commercialize a Gabor-domain optical coherence microscope to enable non-invasive, high-definition, wide field of view imaging in 3D for eye banks.","High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging",10007064,R44EY028827,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Blindness', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Density', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Viability Process', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Banks', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Innovation Corps', 'International', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Patient imaging', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rights', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical imaging', 'commercial application', 'density', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo regeneration', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurosensory', 'novel', 'phase 2 study', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'trend']",NEI,LIGHTOPTECH CORPORATION,R44,2020,795732,0.003878218862936648
"Center for Open Bioimage Analysis Project Summary  The Center for Open Bioimage Analysis will serve the cell biology community’s growing need for sophisticated software for light microscopy image analysis. Quantitative image analysis has become an indispensable tool for biologists using microscopy throughout basic biological and biomedical research.  Quantifying images is now a critical, widespread need as imaging experiments continue to grow in scale, size, dimensionality, scope, modality, and complexity. Many biologists are missing out on the quantitative bioimaging revolution due to lack of effective algorithms and/or usable software for their needs, or lack of access to training. The Center brings together the Carpenter laboratory at the Broad Institute and the Eliceiri laboratory at the University of Wisconsin­Madison, and in doing so brings together the two most popular open source bioimage analysis projects, ImageJ (including ImageJ2 and FIJI) and CellProfiler. Through the collaborative development and dissemination of open source image analysis software, as well as training events and resources, the Center will empower thousands of researchers to apply advanced analytics in innovative ways to address new experimental areas.  Building on the team’s expertise developing algorithms and user­friendly software for use in biology under real­world conditions, the Center will focus on two Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects: deep learning­based image processing, and accessibility of image­processing algorithms for biologists. This work will not occur in isolation at the Center; rather, the Center will nucleate a larger community working on these two areas and serve as a catalyst and organizing force to create software and resources shared by all.  The Driving Biological Projects (DBPs) will serve a major role in driving the TR&D work: our teams are accustomed to working deeply and iteratively on problems side by side and with frequent feedback from biologists. This will ensure that important cell biological problems drive the work of the Center. The DBPs reflect tremendous variety in terms of biological questions, model systems, imaging modalities, and researcher expertise and will ensure robustness of our tools for the widest possible impact on the community. Continuing the teams’ track record with ImageJ and CellProfiler, two mature open source bioimage analysis software projects critical to the work of biologists worldwide, the Center will also assist and train biologists in applying the latest computational techniques to important biological problems involving images.  In short, the need for robust, accurate, and readily usable software is more urgent than ever. The Center for Open Bioimage Analysis will serve as a hub for pioneering new computational strategies for diverse biological problems, translating them into user­friendly software, further developing ImageJ and CellProfiler, and training the biological community to apply advanced software to important and diverse problems in cell biology. Project Narrative Biologists studying a huge variety of diseases and basic biological processes need software to measure cells, tissues, and organisms in microscopy images.

"Generation of parametric images for FDG PET using dual-time-point scans Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) using the radiolabeled tracer 2- deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) has become a standard imaging tool for cancer patient management. The semi-quantitative parameter standardized uptake value (SUV) is routinely used in clinical for tumor uptake quantification, which is computed on the static PET image acquired at a certain time (typically 60 min) post tracer injection for a short interval (typically 5-15 min). However, the quantification accuracy of SUV from a single PET scan suffers from the variabilities of tracer plasma clearance and acquisition start time. The dual- time-point FDG PET imaging has been intensively investigated and used in both clinical and research studies, typically one scan at 60 min and the other at 120 min, showing the potential to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET by differentiating malignancy from inflammation and normal tissue. However, the current clinical dual-time-point FDG PET studies use the relative SUV change between two scans as the quantification index, which cannot eliminate the variations in tracer plasma clearance. Meanwhile, the dual-time-point protocol has not been optimized and standardized currently, leading to conflicting results. The fully-quantitative parameter, tracer net uptake rate constant Ki, is the most accurate parameter to quantify FDG PET, which is calculated using dynamic imaging with compartmental modeling. Ki is independent on the plasma clearance or acquisition start time. However, the long and complex acquisition protocol (typically at least 60 min), which requires dynamic scanning and sequential arterial blood sampling (or image-derived blood activity) used as input function from the time of injection, limits its application in clinical practice. Meanwhile, generation of the parametric Ki image, which can provide additional heterogeneity information for FDG PET, is challenging clinically using voxel-by-voxel compartmental modeling due to the computational cost and being sensitive to noise using non-linear least squares. The graphical Patlak plot, can be used for simplified Ki calculation and Ki image generation by voxel-by-voxel fitting. However, it still needs dynamic scanning starting from 15-30 min after injection and input function from the time of injection. The aims of this proposal are 1) to optimize the dual-time-point protocol for accurate Ki quantification using Patlak plot without the need for individual patient's input function, and 2) to generate high-quality low-noise dual-time-point Ki images using novel techniques based on deep learning. Upon the success of this project, our proposed approach can obtain reliable tumor Ki quantification and parametric Ki image ""for free"" without adding any additional complexity on the existing dual- time-point protocol currently used in clinical practice, with great potential of improving diagnosis and therapy assessment in oncology. We expect the translation of this approach to clinical investigation to be fast, as this is a post-processing approach and is based on data already acquired using clinically used protocol without imposing additional burden to technologists. Project Narrative For FDG PET imaging, we propose to develop a novel and simple approach of quantifying tumor Ki and generating parametric Ki image ""for free"" without adding any additional complexity on the existing dual-time- point protocol currently used in clinical practice, with great potential of improving diagnosis and therapy assessment in oncology.",Generation of parametric images for FDG PET using dual-time-point scans,9896329,R03EB027864,"['Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Inflammation', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Plasma', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiolabeled', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'parametric imaging', 'population based', 'research study', 'simulation', 'success', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,80375,0.004622589786538598
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information.

"Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the introduction of many novel techniques to minimize radiation dose in CT, there is still a large variation in terms of radiation dose levels prescribed in CT exams and therefore a large variation of diagnostic performance. Some patients may receive higher dose than necessary. Some may be under-dosed and mis- diagnosed as a result of insufficient image quality. In order to determine the appropriate amount of radiation dose reduction in each exam, accurate quantification of diagnostic performance is needed so that the dose reduction can be achieved without sacrificing important diagnostic information. However, currently there is a lack of efficient and quantitative tools for objective assessment of diagnostic performance, particularly for many of the novel dose reduction methods involving non-linear processing of the data such as iterative reconstruction and deep-learning-based noise reduction methods. The specific goal of this application is to disseminate a highly automated solution, CT Protocol optimization (CTPro) software, to a wide CT community. This quantitative tool provides an efficient implementation of diagnostic performance assessment and CT radiation dose optimization. This tool is based on channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), which itself was developed decades ago to mimic human observer visual responses in signal detection tasks. However, the use of CHO in clinical CT is quite limited because of a lack of rigorous validation and efficient and robust implementation in practice. We were the first to demonstrate its correlation with human observer performance in low-contrast detection, classification and localization tasks in clinical CT. The main objective of the current proposal is to optimize this tool for simplicity and robustness, and disseminate it to CT researchers and clinical users, which will be accomplished through 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Optimize CTPro for simplicity, robustness, and generalizability. Aim 2: Develop an open-source web-based platform for software dissemination. Aim 3: Build use cases and disseminate CTPro. The proposed work is significant because the software tool will allow any CT users and researchers to perform CT radiation dose optimization and diagnostic performance evaluation in an efficient, quantitative, and objective manner. This work is innovative in that the automated tool will use quantitative measures of diagnostic performance to systematically guide the complex task of CT dose optimization, moving beyond traditional metrics that are inappropriate for many novel dose reduction techniques. The software tool, once widely employed, will facilitate a paradigm shift in how dose optimization and the evaluation of dose reduction techniques are performed, and will allow a more rapid and consistent adoption of dose reduction technology into clinical practice, which will benefit millions of CT patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a lack of quantitative tools for efficient and objective assessment of diagnostic performance in CT, which is the reason why inappropriate radiation dose is frequently used in CT exams, resulting in unnecessarily high radiation exposure to patients or lose of important diagnostic information. The purpose of this project is to disseminate a highly automated solution to a wide CT community for efficient CT radiation dose optimization. If successful, appropriate amount of radiation can be prescribed for millions of CT patients at any facility, while maintaining the level of diagnostic information required for high quality patient care.",Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment,10019348,U24EB028936,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Encapsulated', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newsletter', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'symposium', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'web site']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U24,2020,314388,-0.0033198362867172806
"ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis Project Summary The morphology (or shape) of anatomical structures forms the common language among clinicians, where ab- normalities in anatomical shapes are often tied to deleterious function. While these observations are often quali- tative, ﬁnding subtle, quantitative shape effects requires the application of mathematics, statistics, and computing to parse the anatomy into a numerical representation that will facilitate testing of biologically relevant hypotheses. Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) and its associated suite of software tools, ShapeWorks, enable learning population-level shape representation via automatic dense placement of homologous landmarks on image seg- mentations of general anatomy with arbitrary topology. The utility of ShapeWorks has been demonstrated in a range of biomedical applications. Despite its obvious utility for the research enterprise and highly permissive open-source license, ShapeWorks does not have a viable commercialization path due to the inherent trade-off between development and maintenance costs, and a specialized scientiﬁc and clinical market. ShapeWorks has the potential to transform the way researchers approach studies of anatomical forms, but its widespread ap- plicability to medicine and biology is hindered by several barriers that most existing shape modeling packages face. The most important roadblocks are (1) the complexity and steep learning curve of existing shape modeling pipelines and their increased computational and computer memory requirements; (2) the considerable expertise, time, and effort required to segment anatomies of interest for statistical analyses; and (3) the lack of interoperable implementations that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research laboratories. In this project, we pro- pose ShapeWorksStudio, a software suite that leverages ShapeWorks for the automated population-/patient-level modeling of anatomical shapes, and Seg3D – a widely used open-source tool to visualize and process volumet- ric images – for ﬂexible manual/semiautomatic segmentation and interactive manual correction of segmented anatomy. In Aim 1, we will integrate ShapeWorks and Seg3D in a framework that supports big data cohorts to enable users to transparently proceed from image data to shape models in a straightforward manner. In Aim 2, we will endow Seg3D with a machine learning approach that provides automated segmentations within a statisti- cal framework that combines image data with population-speciﬁc shape priors provided by ShapeWorks. In Aim 3, we will support interoperability with existing open-source software packages and toolkits, and provide bindings to commonly used programming languages in the biomedical research community. To promote reproducibility, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc test cases. This project combines an interdisciplinary research and development team with decades of experience in statistical analysis and image understanding, and application scientists to conﬁrm that the proposed developments have a real impact on the biomedical and clinical research communities. Our long-term goal is to make ShapeWorks a standard tool for shape analyses in medicine, and the work proposed herein will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative ShapeWorks is a free, open-source software tool that uses a ﬂexible method for automated construction of sta- tistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes. ShapeWorks has been effective in a range of applications, including psychology, biological phenotyping, cardiology, and orthopedics. If funded, this application will ensure the viability of ShapeWorks in the face of the ever-increasing complexity of shape datasets and support its availability to biomedical researchers in the future, as well as provide opportunities for use in a wide spectrum of new biological and clinical applications, including anatomy reconstruction from sparse/low- dimensional imaging data, large-scale clinical trials, surgical planning, optimal designs of medical implants, and reconstructive surgery.","ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis",10023935,U24EB029011,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biological Testing', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Mail', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratory Research', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Programming Languages', 'Psychology', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'medical implant', 'open source', 'outreach', 'particle', 'patient population', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2020,256578,-0.00793915205605425
"In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging ABSTRACT There is still great need in better characterizing new targeted therapies in vivo, especially prior to clinical translation. In this regard, preclinical molecular imaging is a central tool in the targeted drug development pipeline. However, there is still a lack of integrated imaging platforms that can enable longitudinal (multiple time points) and spatially-resolved monitoring of complex fingerprints including molecular, metabolic and functional signatures in the same tumor/subject. This new integrated multiplexing imaging platform will play a crucial role in the development of the next generation of targeted drugs and elucidating (multi-) drug resistance mechanisms. Recently, we have demonstrated the unique capabilities of optical imaging in quantifying receptor-target engagement in live subjects by leveraging fluorescence lifetime. This outstanding achievement was realized thanks to the combination of instrumental, algorithmic and biochemical innovations to enable, for the first time, whole-body time-resolved optical imaging based on structured light for 2D or 3D Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging in live subjects. Herein, we will further impact the field of optical preclinical imaging and drug delivery assessment by 1) integrating a cutting-edge high-resolution, time-resolved SPAD array imager for improved photon collection efficiency, spatial resolution, and portability; 2) we will harness the latest developments in Deep Learning (DL) for ultra-fast, quantitative, but fitting/iterative inverse solver-free image formation, in both 2D and 3D providing image formation/processing solutions to facilitate multiplexed imaging; 3) we will implement new functionalities in our imaging platform to enable the concurrent longitudinal imaging of multiple clinically relevant target-receptor interactions (e.g. HER receptor family members involved in many cancers) as well as metabolic and functional status across the whole-tumor region in live intact animals. NARRATIVE Following an ever increased focus on personalized medicine, there is a continuing need to develop preclinical molecular imaging modalities to guide the development and optimization of targeted therapies. This research program will combine novel time-resolved cameras as well as deep learning techniques to broaden the impact of macroscopic lifetime imaging with the overarching goal to facilitate multiplexed imaging for a comprehensive assessment of cellular delivery efficacy of multiple clinically relevant drugs (e.g. HER receptor family members involved in many cancers) as well as drug response via metabolic and functional status across the whole-tumor region in live intact animals.",In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging,9997447,R01CA250636,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cells', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Electronics', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Family member', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hemoglobin', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging ligands', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Optical Tomography', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photons', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Reporter Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'drug development', 'drug efficacy', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'functional status', 'imager', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multiplexed imaging', 'new technology', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'portability', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical imaging', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'receptor', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'targeted treatment', 'technological innovation', 'tomography', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly']",NCI,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,637634,0.004284285770824921
"Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The inability of non-invasive techniques to quantify disease progression has limited understanding of the pathogenesis of OA. While numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been proposed for imaging OA, sensitivity to bone metabolism has been limited. We propose to develop advanced three-dimensional PET-MRI methods for bone and soft tissue metabolism to study the response of the tissues in the joint to changes in knee load. This work will lead to a new understanding of OA pathogenesis by revealing relationships between changes in cartilage and bone metabolism over time. This project aims to develop PET-MRI methods to sensitively track changes of OA in response to biomechanical loading. Our specific aims are to (1) Develop accurate, reproducible and dose-optimized kinetic models of dynamic 18F-NaF PET-MRI for quantitative bilateral whole joint imaging using deep learning and advanced MR coil technology, (2) Study the relationship between resting state bone metabolism and biomechanics using PET- MRI and (3) Perform a longitudinal study to assess the response of our new imaging methods to changes in joint biomechanics from gait retraining. The innovation of this work lies in the development of novel imaging techniques that simultaneously offer quantitative measures of tissue physiology in cartilage and bone using PET-MRI. The significance of this work is that we will be able to sensitively and quantitatively track changes in bone metabolism and soft tissue microstructure due to changes in biomechanical loading in the knee joint over time. This will provide new and more sensitive imaging tools to assess the responses of the joint to biomechanical interventions to treat OA such as gait retraining, bracing, or high tibial osteotomy. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for assessment of disease-modifying treatments such as bracing or gait modification.

During the previous period of funding, we developed statistical shape modeling (SSM) methods and applied these to the study of structural hip disease. We also developed the initial framework to integrate SSM with finite element (FE) analysis to enable the study of shape and mechanics together. If incorporated into clinical practice, SSM and FE analysis could identify features of the anatomy likely responsible for injury, remodeling, or repair. Geometry needed for SSM and FE models is typically generated by segmentation of volumetric imaging data. This step can be painstakingly slow, error prone, and cost prohibitive, which hampers clinical application of these computational techniques. We have created a deep machine learning algorithm ‘DeepSSM’ that uses a convolutional neural network to establish the correspondence model directly from unsegmented images. In Aim 1 we will apply DepSSM to improve clinical understanding of structural hip disease by characterizing differences in anatomy between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals; these morphometric comparisons will identify anatomic features most telling of disease, thereby guiding improvements in diagnosis. Computational advancements have simplified the process to generate patient-specific FE models, enabling clinically focused research. However, there is no framework to collectively visualize, compare, and interpret (i.e., post-process) results from multiple FE models. Currently, inter-subject comparisons require oversimplifications such as averaging results over subjectively defined regions. In Aim 2 we will develop new post-processing methods to collectively visualize, interpret and statistically analyze FE results across multiple subjects and study groups. We will map FE results to synthetic anatomies representing statistically meaningful distributions using the correspondence model. Statistical parametric mapping will be applied to preserve anatomic detail through statistical testing. We will use our published FE models of hip joint mechanics as the test system. Finally, volumetric images provide a wealth of information that is delivered to physicians in a familiar format. Yet, tools are not available to interpret model data with clinical findings from volumetric images. In Aim 3, we will develop methods that evaluate relationships between shape, mechanics, and clinical findings gleaned from imaging through integrated statistical tests and semi-automatic medical image annotation tools that utilize standard ontologies. Quantitative CT and MRI images of the hip, which estimate bone density and cartilage ultrastructure, respectively, will be evaluated as test datasets. To impart broad impact, we will disseminate our methods to the community as open source software that will call core functionality provided by existing, open source software that has a large user base (FEBio, ShapeWorks). PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed technology will provide the methodologies necessary to increase the clinical acceptance and applicability of computer models. These models measure three-dimensional tissue shape and estimate tissue mechanics, providing information that cannot be measured conventionally. We will implement these methods into software that can be used by the public free-of-charge.",Computational and Statistical Framework to Model Tissue Shape and Mechanics,9972694,R01EB016701,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Bone Density', 'Cardiology', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Glean', 'Grooming', 'Hip Joint', 'Hip region structure', 'Homeostasis', 'Human Pathology', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Libraries', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurology', 'Ontology', 'Orthopedics', 'Pathology', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'disease diagnosis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'shape analysis', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,563658,0.023441945922374054
"Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion Project Summary/Abstract X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been increasingly used in medical diagnosis, currently reaching more than 100 million CT scans every year in the US. The increasing use of CT has sparked concern over the effects of radiation dose on patients. It is estimated that every 2000 CT scans will cause one future cancer, i.e., 50,000 cases of future cancers from 100 million CT scans every year. CT brain perfusion (CTP) is a widely used imaging technique for the evaluation of hemodynamic changes in stroke and cerebrovascular disorders. However, CTP involves high radiation dose for patients as the CTP scan is repeated on the order of 40 times at the same anatomical location, in order to capture the full passage of the contrast bolus. Several techniques have been applied for radiation dose reduction in CTP scans, including reduction of tube current and tube voltage, as well as the use of noise reduction techniques such as iterative reconstruction (IR). However, the resultant radiation dose of existing CTP scans is still significantly higher than that of a standard head CT scan. The application of IR techniques in CTP is very limited due to the high complexity and computational burden for processing multiple CTP images that impairs clinical workflow. During the Phase 1 STTR project, we introduced a novel low dose CTP imaging method based on the k-space weighted image contrast (KWIC) reconstruction algorithm. We performed thorough evaluation in both a CTP phantom and clinical CTP datasets, and demonstrated that the KWIC algorithm is able to reduce the radiation dose of existing CTP techniques by 75% without affecting the image quality and accuracy of quantification (i.e., Milestone of Phase 1 STTR). However, the original KWIC algorithm requires rapid-switching pulsed X-ray at pre-specified rotation angles – a hardware capability yet to be implemented by commercial CT vendors. In order to address this limitation, we recently introduced a variant of the KWIC algorithm termed k-space weighted image average (KWIA) that preserves high spatial and temporal resolutions as well as image quality of low dose CTP data (~75% dose reduction) to be comparable to those of standard CTP scans. Most importantly, KWIA does not require modification of existing CT hardware and is computationally simple and fast, therefore has a low barrier for market penetration. The purpose of the Phase 2 STTR project is to further optimize and validate the KWIA algorithm for reducing radiation dose of CTP scans by ~75% while preserving the image quality and quantification accuracy in CTP phantom, clinical CTP data and animal studies. We will further develop innovative deep-learning (DL) based algorithms to address potential motion and other artifacts in KWIA, and commercialize the developed algorithms by collaborating with CT vendors. Relevance to Public Health More than 100 million CT scans are performed every year in the US, estimated to cause 50,000 cases of future cancers. This project will develop, evaluate and commercialize novel CT imaging technologies that reduce the radiation dose of existing CT perfusion techniques by ~75% without compromising imaging speed or quality.",Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion,10006737,R44EB024438,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Animals', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Infarction', 'Location', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Tube', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'low dose computed tomography', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'preservation', 'radiation effect', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement', 'voltage']",NIBIB,"HURA IMAGING, INC",R44,2020,820709,0.008398370999913068
"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,9942461,R01EY028667,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'mechanical properties', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,391938,-0.008446274658628725
"Simultaneous coaxial widefield imaging and reflectance confocal microscopy for improved diagnosis of skin cancers in vivo 1 Dermatologists rely on visual (clinical widefield) and dermoscopic examination of skin lesions to guide the need  2 for biopsy. With this approach, sensitivity is high, but specificity tends to be quite variable and lower, resulting  3 in millions of biopsies of benign lesions every year. To improve specificity, several optical technologies are  4 being developed to noninvasively detect skin cancer. Of these, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is the  5 furthest advanced in clinical utility, proven for diagnosing skin cancers with high sensitivity and specificity.  6 RCM imaging, guided by dermoscopy, detects skin cancers with 2 times superior specificity, and reduces the  7 benign-to-malignant biopsy rate by 2 times, compared to that with dermoscopy alone. In 2016, the Centers for  8 Medicare and Medicaid Services granted current procedural terminology (CPT) reimbursement codes for RCM  9 imaging of skin. RCM imaging combined with dermoscopy is now advancing into clinical practice, sparing pa- 10 tients from unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. However, toward widespread acceptance and adoption, a 11 key challenge is that clinical widefield examination, dermoscopy and RCM imaging are currently performed as 12 three separate procedures with separate devices. Clinicians do not precisely know the location of RCM imag- 13 es relative to the surrounding contextual lesion morphology that is seen with clinical widefield examination and 14 dermoscopy, resulting in lower and more variable diagnostic accuracy (particularly, sensitivity, positive and 15 negative predictive values). We propose a novel solution: (i) a new objective lens with an integrated micro- 16 camera, to deliver a concurrent widefield image of the skin surface surrounding the location of RCM imaging; 17 (ii) a new software algorithm for widefield image-based tracking of the location of RCM images within a dermoscopic 18 field of view; (iii) a new diagnostic approach that will proactively use widefield imaging to locate RCM images in 19 dermoscopic images. We intend to deliver this integrated widefield clinical, dermoscopic and RCM imaging ap- 20 proach into the clinic, toward a new standard for more accurate, consistent and faster RCM imaging to guide 21 patient care. Preliminary studies with a “mock” objective lens and micro-camera on a bench-top set-up 22 demonstrated excellent optical sectioning (~2 µm) and resolution (~1 µm) for RCM imaging, and accurate and 23 repeatable location of RCM fields-of-view within the widefield image. RCM images showed excellent cellular 24 and morphologic detail in vivo. Our specific aims are (1) to develop a handheld reflectance confocal micro- 25 scope with integrated widefield camera; (2) to develop image processing algorithms for real-time widefield im- 26 aging-guided tracking of RCM image locations within dermoscopic fields; (3) to test and validate performance 27 on 100 patients. Although our proposition is for skin lesions, the research will surely have wider impact for 28 imaging in other settings, particularly, with miniaturized confocal microscopes and endoscopes, which have 29 very small fields-of-view. We are a highly synergistic team from Montana State University, Memorial Sloan 30 Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern University and Caliber Imaging and Diagnostics (formerly, Lucid Inc.). RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Clinical examination and dermoscopy combined with reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging is a newly emerging optical imaging procedure that can noninvasively guide diagnosis of skin cancers, and reduce the need for biopsy. However, clinical examination, dermoscopy and RCM imaging are currently performed as three separate procedures with separate devices, limiting effectiveness and impact. We propose a device to combine the three into a single procedure, which will help dermatologists and patients by making the skin examinations quicker, more accurate and more consistent, expanding the impact of this proven approach.",Simultaneous coaxial widefield imaging and reflectance confocal microscopy for improved diagnosis of skin cancers in vivo,9860776,R01EB028752,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Center', 'Categories', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Current Procedural Terminology', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermatology', 'Dermis', 'Dermoscopy', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Effectiveness', 'Endoscopes', 'Engineering', 'Epidermis', 'Grant', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lesion', 'Lesion by Morphology', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicaid services', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Montana', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinical examination', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gastrointestinal', 'image guided', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'lens', 'medical specialties', 'microscopic imaging', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'optical imaging', 'prospective test', 'reflectance confocal microscopy', 'response', 'routine practice', 'skin lesion', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,MONTANA STATE UNIVERSITY - BOZEMAN,R01,2020,649717,0.022030050530213736
"FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring Project Abstract/Summary Ultra-low dose CT, defined as sub-millisievert (sub-mSv) imaging of the entire chest, abdomen or pelvis, is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, photon starvation and electronic noise make imaging at such dose levels challenging. Photon starvation refers to the number of transmitted photons. When no photons are transmitted, the measurement is essentially useless. If few photons are transmitted, the measurement carries information, but its interpretation and value are confounded by electronic noise. Solutions with encouraging results have been offered for sub-mSv chest imaging, but these are not widely available and not easily generalizable across anatomical sites, vendors and scanner models. We propose a novel, robust solution for ultra-low dose CT that will overcome these issues. We refer to our solution as FAIR-CT, which stands for Finite-Angle Integrated-Ray CT. FAIR-CT operates under the principle that photon starvation and the confounding effect of electronic noise are best handled by avoiding them, which is made possible by increasing the data integration time during the source-detector rotation. FAIR-CT data strongly deviate from the classical CT data model and share the streak artifact problem of sparse view sampling. FAIR-CT data acquisition also affects azimuthal resolution. We anticipate that these issues can be suitably handled using advanced image reconstruction techniques. Once available, FAIR-CT will allow improvements in longitudinal monitoring of patients with chronic diseases such as COPD, urolithiasis and diabetes, thereby reducing mortality and co-morbidities. FAIR-CT will also allow advancing cancer therapy treatments by enabling adjustments in radiation therapy plans between dose fractions without increasing CT radiation exposure, and by facilitating early detection of inflammations in drug-based therapies. To bring FAIR-CT towards fruition, we will work on two specific aims: (1) Creation of a comprehensive collection of FAIR-CT data sets enabling rigorous development, validation and evaluation of image reconstruction algorithms; (2) Development, validation and evaluation of advanced image reconstruction algorithms. The FAIR-CT data sets will involve the utilization of state-of-the-art scanners and include real patient data synthesized from high dose scans acquired for standard of care. Two complementary image reconstruction approaches will be investigated. Namely, model-based iterative reconstruction with non-linear forward model and dedicated compressed sensing regularization; and deep learning-based refinement of FBP reconstructions using target images with task-adapted image quality. Image quality evaluation will account for critical biological variables and involve objective metrics such as structure similarity and contrast-to-noise ratio for clinically-proven lesions, as well as task-based performance metrics involving human readers. Ultra-low dose X-ray computed tomography is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, physics-related challenges and impractical solutions make this concept unavailable for everyday clinical use. We will develop a novel solution that is practical and can quickly be brought to clinical practice.",FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring,9877188,R21EB029179,"['Abdomen', 'Academia', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Body mass index', 'Chest', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computers', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Fruit', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Lesion', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Starvation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'comorbidity', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'expectation', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'low dose computed tomography', 'mortality', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'side effect', 'standard of care', 'targeted imaging', 'urolithiasis']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2020,265345,0.018998745624784034
"Omniview tethered capsule for low cost, non-endoscopic Barrett's esophagus screening in unsedated patients Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. Barrett’s esophagus (BE) confers elevated risk for progression to EAC. Patients diagnosed with BE undergo periodic surveillance endoscopy with biopsies to detect dysplasia which can be treated by endoscopic eradication with radiofrequency ablation before it progresses to EAC. However, the majority of diagnosed EAC patients have not had prior screening endoscopy and present with advanced lesions that limit treatment options and result in poorer survival. The development of a rapid, low cost, well tolerated, non-endoscopic BE screening technique that can be performed in unsedated patients at points of care outside the endoscopy suite would improve BE detection and reduce EAC morbidity and mortality. Our program is a multidisciplinary collaboration among investigators at the Massachusetts Institute Technology and Veteran Affairs Boston Healthcare System / Harvard Medical School that integrates novel optical imaging and software design, preclinical studies in swine, clinical studies in patients, and advanced image processing / machine learning. Aim 1 will develop an omniview tethered capsule technology that generates a map of the esophageal mucosa over a multi-centimeter length of esophagus and a series of wide angle forward views to aid navigation as the capsule is swallowed or retracted. The images will resemble endoscopic white light or narrow band imaging, but will not suffer from perspective distortion present in standard endoscopic or video capsule images. This will facilitate development of automated BE detection algorithms as well as enhance their sensitivity and specificity. This aim will also perform imaging studies in swine as a translational step toward clinical studies. Aim 2 will determine reader sensitivity and specificity for BE detection versus standard endoscopy / biopsy and prepare data for developing automated BE detection. Patients undergoing screening as well as with history of BE undergoing surveillance will be recruited and unsedated capsule imaging will be performed on the same day prior to their endoscopy. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting BE will be assessed using multiple blinded readers and data sets suitable for developing automated BE detection algorithms will be developed. Aim 3 will develop image analysis methods for automated BE detection by investigating classifiers that operate on handcrafted features (colors and textures) and modern deep convolutional neural network methods for direct classification. If successful, this program will develop a rapid, low cost and scalable method for BE screening that would not require patient sedation, endoscopy, or tissue acquisition, and which could be performed in community primary care clinics. The procedure would be much faster and many times lower cost than endoscopy. Automated BE detection would enable immediate results for patient consultation and referral to gastroenterology if indicated. Larger patient populations with expanded risk criteria could be cost effectively screened and access to screening dramatically improved, reducing EAC mortality. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. The program proposes to develop an omniview tethered capsule technology, examination protocol, and automated analysis methods for low cost, rapid, well tolerated, and scalable screening in order to facilitate monitoring and timely treatment.

"Development of a Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) Summary. Our long-term goal is to develop a powerful tool based on multiphoton microscopy (MPM) for non- invasive human skin imaging in order to improve clinical diagnosis, guide effective treatment and advance clinical and cosmetic/pharmaceutical research by providing access to dynamic cellular and molecular processes during therapy. MPM is a nonlinear optical imaging technique that provides unique structural and molecular contrast based on endogenous signals such as second harmonic generation from collagen and two- photon excited fluorescence from NADH/FAD+, keratin, melanin and elastin fibers. This contrast allows MPM to provide multi-color, rich molecular information content images that can enhance diagnostic accuracy. MPM overcomes fundamental limitations of existing optical imaging technologies for sub-surface skin imaging and extends the area of applicability beyond skin lesions that can be diagnosed through morphological assessment alone. Validation of the clinical potential of this technology has been facilitated over the past 10 years by a device developed by Jenlab in Germany, currently the only clinical MPM system on the market. This device has technical limitations in terms of field-of-view (FOV), imaging speed, complexity and cost, which are major barriers to clinical adoption. The goal of this Phase I proposal is to develop and test the technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging of a MPM system that is highly optimized for rapid, label-free, macroscopic imaging of human skin with microscopic resolution. The Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) imaging platform will incorporate the innovative optical engine of a benchtop prototype developed at BLI. InfraDerm will innovate on this design to transform it into a compact, portable device, suitable for human skin imaging in clinical setting. Key innovations include: 1) a compact engineering design based on integrating a compact fs fiber laser into the imaging head along with a customized folded optical design to reduce complexity and cost and enhance portability; 2) hardware and software strategies that include a customized patient interface and a combination of optical and mechanical scanning mechanisms with deep learning image restoration to allow millimeter-to-centimeter scale imaging within minutes while maintaining sub-micron resolution. This approach will expand the in vivo imaging area from mm to cm scale, which will be scanned within minutes with sub- cellular resolution. In Aim 1 we will develop the FLAME prototype that incorporates these features. In Aim 2 we will test its technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging by evaluating potential effects of motion artifacts. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate the FLAME system potential for non-invasive assessment of melanin content, an ability with potential impact in differential diagnosis and early assessment of treatment efficacy of pigmentary skin disorders, such as melasma. Phase II will refine the technological approach and will test the device feasibility in a first clinical application, differential diagnosis of patients with melasma, a long time dermatology challenge and a particular interest for pharma companies developing therapies for this skin condition. Narrative  InfraDerm LLC proposes to develop and test the technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging of a laser scanning microscope based on multiphoton microscopy (MPM) that addresses fundamental and technical limitations of existing optical imaging technologies for sub-surface skin imaging, extending the area of applicability beyond skin lesions that can be diagnosed through morphological assessment alone. The proposed Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) prototype will be highly optimized for rapid, label- free, macroscopic imaging of human skin with microscopic resolution. An MPM clinical platform, uniquely equipped with this combination of features would embody an innovative and commercially viable product that will broadly impact clinical diagnosis and research in dermatology as well as in cosmetic and pharmaceutical research.",Development of a Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME),10153566,R43EB030931,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Alopecia', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biopsy', 'Cell physiology', 'Chloasma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collagen', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disclosure', 'Elastin', 'Elastin Fiber', 'Excision', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Face', 'Fiber', 'Fluorescence', 'Generations', 'Germany', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Keratin', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Melanins', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'NADH', 'Nevus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pigments', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effective therapy', 'engineering design', 'human imaging', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'millimeter', 'multiphoton imaging', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'optical imaging', 'portability', 'prototype', 'response', 'restoration', 'second harmonic', 'skin disorder', 'skin lesion', 'submicron', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIBIB,"INFRADERM, LLC",R43,2020,263074,0.02401821994076386
"STAN-CT: Standardization and Normalization of CT images for Lung Cancer Patients Project Summary/Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and one of the most common cancers among both men and women in the United States. Recent advances in high-resolution imaging set the stage for radiomics to become an active emerging field in cancer research. However, the promise of radiomics is limited by a lack of image standardization tools, because computed tomography (CT) images are often acquired using scanners from different vendors with customized acquisition parameters, posing a fundamental challenge to radiomic studies across sites. To overcome this challenge, especially for large-scale, multi-site radiomic studies, advanced algorithms are required to integrate, standardize, and normalize CT images from multiple sources. We propose to develop STAN-CT, a deep learning software package that can automatically standardize and normalize a large volume of diagnostic images to facilitate cross-site large-scale image feature extraction for lung cancer characterization and stratification. By precisely mitigating the differences in advanced radiomic features of CT images, STAN-CT will overcome research silos and promote medical image resource sharing, ultimately improving the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. Our goal will be achieved through two Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a working prototype to standardize CT images. First, we will collect raw image data from lung cancer patients and reconstruct CT images using multiple image reconstruction parameters, and we will scan a multipurpose chest phantom along with five different nodule inserts. Then, we will develop and train STAN-CT for CT image standardization. An alternative training architecture will be developed to achieve the improved model training stability. In Aim 2. We will deploy and test STAN-CT for image standardization locally and across three medical centers. First, we will make the STAN-CT software package available to the public by providing a menu-driven web-interface so that that users can conveniently convert medical images that were taken using non-standard protocols to one or multiple standards that they specify. Second, we will deploy STAN-CT at the University of Kentucky for local performance validation. We will test the functionality, reliability, and performance of STAN-CT using both patient chest CT image data collected at large-scale and the phantom image data, both independent to training. Third, we will deploy and test STAN-CT at the University of Kentucky as well as the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Emory University for cross- center performance validation. We will use the same multipurpose chest phantom and both standard and non- standard protocols to validate STAN-CT at the three centers. We will test the generalizability of STAN-CT using clinical CT images of human patients and will determine whether a model trained using the data from one medical center are applicable for images collected at another place. Finally, we will distribute the software package of STAN-CT for public use. STAN-CT will enable a wide range of radiomic researches to identify diagnostic image features that strongly associated with lung cancer prognosis. Project Narrative Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most popular diagnostic image modalities routinely used for assessing anatomical tissue characteristics for disease management. However, CT images are often acquired using scanners from different vendors with different imaging standards, posing a fundamental challenge to radiomic studies across sites. The goal of the Standardization and Normalization of CT images for lung cancer patients (STAN-CT) project is to develop a deep learning software package that can automatically standardize and normalize a large volume of chest CT images to facilitate cross-site large-scale image feature extraction for lung cancer characterization and stratification.",STAN-CT: Standardization and Normalization of CT images for Lung Cancer Patients,9961508,R21CA231911,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Management', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Imaging technology', 'Kentucky', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Names', 'Nodule', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'chest computed tomography', 'computational platform', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'feature extraction', 'high resolution imaging', 'human imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'lung imaging', 'member', 'men', 'outcome forecast', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'response', 'spatial temporal variation', 'tool', 'trait', 'tumor', 'web interface']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R21,2020,175505,-0.014178886674842793
"Human Tumor Atlas Network: Data Coordinating Center Supplement This proposal is a collaboration with the HTAN Data Coordination Center DCC and describes an Image Data Project aimed at developing and deploying the technology needed for storage, distribution and basic analysis of cell and tissue images collected by multiple HTAN Centers. Multiplexed tissue images are an important type of data for nearly all of the centers contributing to the HTAN (second only to single cell sequencing data in number of centers collecting data). However, the software needed to visualize, analyze, manage, and share multiplexed images of tissues and tumors is underdeveloped. The initial availability of SARDANA images has highlighted the challenges faced by HTAN, including the DCC, in deploying an infrastructure for distributing large and complex images. We therefore propose a two-year HTAN Image Data Project (IDP) led by the DCC and HMS PCA focused on the rapid development and deployment of image informatic systems and computational resources for image management and analysis. Our goal is to put in place a functional first-generation system no later than summer 2020 and to then steadily refine the system so that it becomes the backbone of cross-functional HTAN atlases. As a matter of necessity, we will start with informatic systems and software that are either available today or in a relatively advanced state of development. However, we expect to evaluate these choices throughout the IDP and change course as necessary to incorporate potentially superior approaches. We will also support the diverse needs and formats of centers using different data collection methods. Aim 1 will focus on the deployment and progressive improvement of a cloud-based database for image management based on the OMERO standard as well as a parallel system for access to primary data. Aim 2 will develop and deploy software for visualizing HTAN image data by the general public. The IDP will use the existing MCWG and DAWG mechanisms for oversight and reporting, and all centers will be invited to participate. Within IDP, the HMS PCA will take primary responsibility for initial deployment of image informatics software. The DCC and HMS will jointly undertake software development and code hardening, and the DCC will take the lead in user assistance and software deployment, particularly in year two. Images of tumor specimens obtained from biopsy or surgery are one of the primary ways in which cancer is diagnosed and staged by pathologists, but such images have typically lacked molecular detail. The highly multiplexed tissue images being collected by HTAN will fundamentally change this, and it is therefore essential that the data be efficiently and widely distributed. The HTAN Image Data Project IDP will address an acute need for software for data dissemination and visualization.",Human Tumor Atlas Network: Data Coordinating Center Supplement,10206514,U24CA233243,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Atlases', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy', 'Client', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'European', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Performance', 'Reporting', 'Side', 'Slide', 'Software Tools', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Vertebral column', 'Visualization', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cellular imaging', 'cloud based', 'computing resources', 'data dissemination', 'data management', 'data resource', 'data visualization', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multiplexed imaging', 'programs', 'relational database', 'single cell sequencing', 'software development', 'supervised learning', 'tumor']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,U24,2020,926364,0.020838406715178337
"Multiband ASL for Neurodevelopment Study Project Summary/Abstract The developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood is marked by a mix of potential and vulnerability. A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during this critical period, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and the first signs of emotional disorders. It is important to understand detailed patterns of typical development, so alterations can be identified and rectified as early as possible. As an entirely noninvasive and quantitative imaging method, arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is increasingly being recognized as an important biomarker for functional brain development in both healthy populations and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, there remain significant challenges for making ASL an impactful tool in studying neurodevelopment, including: 1) a coarse spatial resolution of ~4x4x4mm3, 2) susceptibility to head motion with segmented 3D acquisitions, and 3) potential confounding effects of age dependent variations in arterial transit time using a single post-labeling delay (PLD) scan. Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) or multiband (MB) is a new accelerated imaging technology that simultaneously excites multiple slices and recovers each slice with parallel imaging techniques. Preliminary studies combining MB with ASL showed that MB can reduce T1 relaxation of the label, improve spatial coverage and/or resolution compared to those of standard 2D ASL. MB imaging may also overcome the limitation of 3D ASL acquisitions in terms of head motion and spatial blurring. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of existing MB ASL is inferior to that of 3D ASL. This project builds on two recent innovations from our lab: 1) a constrained slice-dependent (CSD) background suppression (BS) technique that improves the SNR of 2D MB pCASL to be comparable to that of 3D pCASL; and 2) a single-shot 3D GRASE pCASL method with 2D CAIPIRINHA accelerations that improves the imaging speed of 3D pCASL. The goal of this R01 project is to develop and evaluate cutting-edge MB pCASL protocols that are able to offer a high spatial resolution of isotropic 2mm or higher, resistance to head motion and multi-delay capability for accurate perfusion quantification in pediatric populations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoising algorithm for multi-delay MB pCASL will be further developed. The developed suite of MB pCASL protocol and post- processing algorithms will be evaluated in 40 typically developing children and adolescents. The successful completion of this R01 project will lead to a robust multi-delay MB pCASL protocol that is highly valuable as potential biomarker for both neurodevelopment research and pediatric clinical care. To maximize the scientific and clinical impact, we will continue disseminating the pulse sequence and associated post-processing software as we have been doing in the past decade. Relevance to Public Health A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during the developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and emotional disorders. This project will develop a robust noninvasive imaging technique using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that offers high spatial resolution, resistance to head motion and accurate quantification of cerebral blood flow in children and adolescents.

"SUPPORT AND DEVELOPMENT OF EMAN FOR ELECTRON MICROSCOPY IMAGE PROCESSING EMAN is one of the most well-established and widely used scientific image processing suites targeting the rapidly growing CryoEM/CryoET community worldwide. In turn, the CryoEM and CryoET studies which it enables permit determination of the structures of interacting macromolecules both in-vitro and in-vivo, and are being used to better understand the biochemical processes taking place in cells, to better identify potential drug targets and develop novel diagnostics. With the higher resolutions now possible in this field, direct drug interaction structural studies are now possible, and being used to gain insight into the mode of action of drugs within the cell. Unlike many newer tools in the field, such as Relion, CisTEM and CryoSparc, which focus on specific refinement tasks, EMAN is a versatile, modular suite capable of performing a variety of image processing tasks with hundreds of algorithms supporting virtually all of the standard file formats and mathematical conventions used in the field, as well as other related imaging fields. It provides an ideal platform for prototyping fundamental new algorithm developments, while still able to achieve data-limited resolution in single particle reconstruction. While high resolution single particle refinement has become routine in recent years, thanks largely to the dramatic data quality improvements provided by new detector technology, there remain significant opportunities for improvements in mitigating model bias, efficient use of data, and analysis of complexes with compositional or conformational variability. Some of the most important problems from a biological perspective involve the sort of compositional and conformational variability which remain challenging problems. The field also remains susceptible to problems of initial model bias, which are exacerbated in systems exhibiting structural variability, and as a result many structures are still published with exaggerated resolution claims. The standard protocols used by many in the field typically involve discarding a very large fraction of the raw data (as much as 80-90% in some cases), often based on qualitative assessments, raising questions related to rigor and reproducibility of structural results. In this proposal, we will develop or adapt image processing techniques to help resolve these issues, based on developments or unrealized concepts from mathematics and computer science. CryoEM and CryoET are used to study the structures of interacting biomolecules in the cell at resolutions 100x better than the best possible light microscope. This methodology permits new insights into the biomolecules which underlie disease, can shed light on structural changes in diseased cells and provide direct information on how drugs interact with the molecules they target.

"Fully-Automated Lesion Characterization in Ultrawide-Field Retinal Images Abstract  In this grant application we propose to develop, EyeReadUWF, a fully automated tool for lesion characterization in ultra-widefield scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (UWF SLO) images. In recent times non mydriatic UWF SLO imaging has been shown to be a promising alternative to conventional digital color fundus imaging for grading of diabetic eye diseases, with advantages including 130°-200° field-of-view showing more than 80% of the retina in a single image, no need for multiple fields, multiple flashes, or refocusing between field acquisitions, ability to penetrate media opacities like cataract, and lower rate of ungradable images. UWF SLO images are particularly suitable for detecting predominantly peripheral lesions (PPLs), which have been associated with higher risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression. Accurate quantification of presence and extent of PPLs can only be done by a robust automated tool that is specifically designed for the pseudo-colored images of UWF SLO modality. EyeReadUWF will automatically characterize lesions in pseudo colored UWF images while handling possible artifacts from eyelashes/eyelids and determine the lesion predominance in peripheral and central regions of UWF image. The ability to accurately quantify the presence and extent of predominantly peripheral lesions in UWF SLO images can enable clinicians to develop a more precise DR scoring scheme. This would help identify patients with higher risk of DR progression and onset of PDR, have a positive impact on diabetic patient management, and aid drug discovery research. Narrative The proposed tool, EyeReadUWF, will perform automated lesion characterization in ultra- widefield scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (UWF SLO) images to quantify the presence and extent of predominantly peripheral lesions (PPLs), which have been associated with higher risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression. To the best of our knowledge, no commercial automated analysis tool is currently indicated for UWF SLO images.

"3-D Imaging Flow Cytometry PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to develop and test two innovative platforms and related software for 3-D imaging flow cytometry of fluorescent or absorbing (stained) samples. These systems will allow 3-D structural and functional imaging of many single cells at a subcellular resolution and at a scale that used to be available only in flow cytometry or recently in 2-D imaging. Thereby, the proposed methods have the potential to fundamentally change the ways cultured cells, patient-derived samples, and small experimental organisms are studied. Automated classification based on the 3-D features will enable the diagnosis of hematologic disorders at single-cell precision. Existing 3-D microscopy methods can provide the same information at higher resolution; however, by relying on a scanning mechanism they cannot be applied to suspending cells, especially in a flow configuration, which is essential for high-speed interrogation. Snapshot 3-D microscopy techniques have been developed to address this challenge, but they have insufficient spatial resolution for single-cell imaging and suffer from long data processing time. We overcome these limitations by combining two novel snapshot techniques developed by the PI with the most rigorous optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies. We will use an array of lenslets, which simultaneously records many projection images corresponding with different viewing angles. The use of pupil phase masks, designed using wavefront coding and a theory of 3-D high-numerical-aperture optical imaging, will increase the resolution of each projection image to the theoretical limit given by the objective-lens numerical aperture. The target resolution is 0.5 µm, which is comparable to existing 2-D imaging flow cytometry systems. The target imaging throughputs based on current component technologies are 120 volumes/sec for fluorescence imaging and 700 volumes/sec for absorption imaging, which are higher than 100 volumes/sec of cutting-edge 3-D optical microscopy for stationary specimens. The vast amount of data acquired by these 3-D imaging systems imposes a serious challenge to data processing. The developed systems record true projection images, which obviate iterative deconvolution process, thereby allowing much faster tomographic reconstruction than in existing snapshot techniques. Using general-purpose graphics processing units and optical diffraction tomography, which includes the diffraction of light by subcellular organelles, our tomographic reconstruction algorithm will be faster yet more accurate than existing approaches. Further, we will explore the feasibility of applying a deep convolutional neural network to the images acquired by the developed systems for accurate single-cell classification based on 3-D features. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop 3-D imaging flow cytometry platforms for fluorescent or absorbing (stained) cells at high resolution and high throughput in a flow configuration. The developed systems will be built upon two novel snapshot 3-D techniques developed by the PI in combination with most rigorous 3-D optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies.

"Simulation Tools for 3D and 4D CT and Dosimetry Abstract Photon-counting CT (PCCT) is a major technological advance in CT imaging. Using photon-counting instead of current energy-integrating detectors, PCCT can offer superior performance in terms of spatial resolution, artifact reduction, and most notably, material decomposition. PCCT’s energy differentiation utility offers an ability to more precisely distinguish different materials and optimize and expand the use of contrast agents in CT. With these abilities, PCCT can significantly facilitate quantitative imaging, reduce radiation exposure, and enable revolutionary new applications in functional and physiological imaging beyond existing CT techniques. To realize the full potential of PCCT in clinical practice, the technology needs comprehensive assessments and application-based optimizations. Effective design and deployment of PCCT depends on many design and use choices that should be made in view of the eventual clinical utility. Making these choices requires large scale trials on actual patients. However, such trials are challenging, considering the need to make many decisions prior to prototyping, the limited numbers of prototype PCCT scanners available today, and the often-unknown ground-truth in the patient images. Even for existing prototype systems, many decisions require repetitive trials with multiple acquisitions. This is both unethical and impractical considering radiation safety concerns and costs. These challenges can be overcome by utilizing virtual imaging trials (VITs) using computerized patients and imaging models. VITs provide an efficient means with which to determine the most effective and optimized design and use of imaging technologies with complete control over the study design. In our prior funded project, we developed a VIT framework to evaluate standard energy-integrating detector CT technologies. In this project, we expand the applicability of this framework to photon-counting detector CT. Specifically, we enhance our computational XCAT phantoms to model the necessary higher-resolution detail including normal and abnormal tissue heterogeneities and intra-organ contrast perfusion diversity across populations (Aim 1). To image the phantoms, we develop the first PCCT simulator capable of mimicking existing and emerging prototypes (Aim 2). The enhanced VIT framework will provide the essential foundation with which to comprehensively evaluate and optimize PCCT technologies and applications. In Aim 3, we assess and optimize the use of PCCT for morphological, textural, and compositional quantification in select oncologic and cardiac applications, two leading health detriments in the US where PCCT can offer a notable impact. The results will be the first of their kind in comprehensively evaluating the task-based merits and capabilities of PCCT, determining optimum dose per patient size for PCCT imaging of patients for cancerous lesions and cardiac plaque/stenoses, and helping to establish the effective utility of PCCT in clinical care. The purpose of this project is to develop and utilize a virtual framework to comprehensively evaluate and optimize emerging photon-counting devices and applications in CT imaging. The results will be the first of their kind evaluating the task-based merits and capabilities of photon-counting CT and will help establish its effectual utility in oncologic and cardiac care.",Simulation Tools for 3D and 4D CT and Dosimetry,10051026,R01EB001838,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Anatomy', 'Cancerous', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Imaging technology', 'Industry', 'Lesion', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Stenosis', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cardiac plaque', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'dosimetry', 'experimental study', 'human imaging', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'photon-counting detector', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual imaging']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,545403,0.014725660594157655
"Quantitative Low-Dose PET Imaging Project summary Quantitative PET has become increasingly important in clinical management and research, in particular for predicting and assessing response to therapy for cancer patients. Current PET protocols involve injection of PET tracers that typically result in ~6-7 mSv radiation dose to patients. For patients who require multiple repeated PET scans to monitor the response to therapy, and for patients who need PET scans with two or more tracers (e.g., FDG + FLT) to optimally predict response to therapy, it is critical to reduce the radiation dose from the PET tracer injection, while still maintaining the quantitative accuracy and image quality for cancer management. When reducing injection dose, the PET images will have higher noise due to fewer detected counts, which will subsequently introduce errors in quantitative measurements. For moving organs and tumors such as those in the lung and abdomen, respiratory motion can substantially degrade quantitative accuracy, so motion correction is required. Conventional motion correction uses a gating strategy that rebins the PET data, resulting in substantially higher noise in each gate. More advanced methods incorporate motion vector estimation in the image domain for post-registration or motion compensated image reconstruction using all detected events without increasing noise. The motion vectors need to be derived from gated PET, which are even noisier when using a reduced tracer injection in low-dose studies, imposing substantial challenges for accurate and reliable voxel-by-voxel motion vector estimation. In dynamic PET studies with clinical cardiac tracers and other novel oncology and neurology tracers, quantification is even more challenging for low-dose PET as each dynamic frame only contains a small fraction of detected events so the high image noise will affect the determination of image-derived input functions and can lead to bias and high noise in parametric images. In this project, to reduce image noise and maintain quantitative accuracy in PET, we propose to develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple innovative imaging methods for low-dose PET data to achieve comparable quantitative accuracy as full-dose PET. While the imaging developments are generally applicable to all PET tracers in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, since cancer is the primary clinical application of PET, we will focus our investigation and optimization in this project on three lung cancer imaging tracers at different clinical adoption stages as examples: 1) 18F-FDG as a routine clinical tracer, 2) 18F-FMISO for hypoxia studies as a tracer for human research, and 3) 18F-PD-L1 that specifically binds to human PD-L1 in tumors and other organs as a recent first-in-human tracer. For each tracer, we will investigate 1) static PET, 2) gated and respiratory motion corrected PET, and 3) dynamic PET. Project narrative Patient radiation dose is a major concern in PET imaging. This project will be an important step to develop and standardize low-dose PET imaging methods and provide guidance for clinical practice, research studies, and both single and multiple site clinical trials for PET dose reduction.

"Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Abstract PET is a molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology studies due to its high sensitivity and the potential of early diagnosis. For neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), 68Ga-DOTATATE PET has been recently used in clinical routine for imaging NETs in adult and pediatric patients since 2016. It plays an important role in the diagnosis and staging of NETs. However, compared to 18F-FDG PET, the image quality of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is lower due to much larger positron range, shorter half-life, and lower dose administration limited by generator capacity. All of these compromises the lesion detectability of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET, especially for small lesions, and can potentially lead to inaccurate NET diagnosis. As 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is increasingly used in clinics, there is an urgent and unmet need to further optimize 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging for NET detection. Recently, data-driven methods have been developed for PET image denoising, where the PET system model is not considered. As the tumor-to-background ratio of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is greater than 18F-FDG PET, the lesion recovery of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET can be hugely influenced by the smoothing effects as well as potential mismatches between training and testing datasets. In this study, we propose a novel data- informed and lesion detection-driven image reconstruction framework. The PET system model, image denoising module, and lesion-detection module will all be included in this reconstruction framework. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop a lesion detection-driven PET image reconstruction framework and validate it based on comprehensive computer simulations, (2) to apply the proposed reconstruction framework to existing clinical 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT datasets and test it based on various figure-of-merits. We expect that the integrated outcome of the specific aims will be a novel and robust image reconstruction framework to better recover lesions in a 68Ga- DOTATATE PET scan, which is essential for NET managements. Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection  Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality widely used in oncology. This project aims to develop a novel lesion detection-driven PET image reconstruction framework. Success of this project can enhance the lesion detectability of current PET imaging protocols, e.g. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scanning for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).",Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection,10041119,R03EB030280,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Biological Models', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gallium', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors', 'Noise', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Positron', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Reader', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer type', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'neural network', 'neuroendocrine differentiation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pediatric patients', 'pentetreotide', 'radiologist', 'radiotracer', 'reconstruction', 'routine imaging', 'success', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2020,94255,0.019912972728992725
"Multi-Task MR Simulation for Abdominal Radiation Treatment Planning ABSTRACT The accuracy of radiation treatment planning (RTP) heavily influences the effectiveness of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Individualized RTP begins with a “simulation”, in which the patient in a treatment position is commonly scanned using computed tomography (CT) to define the treatment target and organs at risk (OARs). When soft-tissue contrast is inadequate to support accurate target and OAR delineation in CT based RTP, conservatively large treatment margins are used to avoid a geometric miss. The crude treatment prevents delivering sufficient radiation dose to the tumor without exceeding the tolerance of surrounding normal tissues. Magnetic resonance (MR) can be used as a simulation platform complementary to CT for improved soft-tissue conspicuity. Yet, such a complicated, costly and tedious multi-modal RTP workflow along with unavoidable systematic MR-CT co-registration errors has limited its applications in EBRT, especially at the abdominal site whereby anatomies are highly mobile. Over the past few years, there is a keen interest in the integration of MR alone into RTP and even the therapy workflow (i.e. MR-guided radiotherapy, MRgRT). The abdomen poses critical challenges to MR simulation. Current MR imaging sequences are suboptimal to produce motion-free images and resolve respiratory motion. MR data processing for abdominal RTP is underdeveloped. Contouring of OARs typically relies on manual, tedious procedures that are time-consuming and variation-prone. In this proposal, we will substantially improve the MR acquisition and multi-organ auto-segmentation, so the potential of MR as a simulation modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal EBRT. Three specific aims will be completed. In Aim 1, we will develop a standalone multi-task MR (MT-MR) sequence dedicated to abdominal MR simulation. In Aim 2, we will optimize multi-organ auto-segmentation based on MT-MR images. In Aim 3, we will assess the performance of MT-MR in the context of pancreatic cancer stereotactic body radiotherapy planning. Successful completion of the project will dramatically improve treatment precision and clinical outcomes, thus further promoting the adoption of radiotherapy in the management of abdominal cancers. Moreover, the developed techniques will open the door to future studies aiming at optimizations in many aspects of radiotherapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Imaging is essential for precise radiation treatment planning. MR based planning is challenging in the abdomen whereby anatomies are highly mobile. We will substantially improve the MR acquisition and multi-organ auto- segmentation, so the potential of MR as an imaging-based planning modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal radiation treatment.",Multi-Task MR Simulation for Abdominal Radiation Treatment Planning,10053211,R01EB029088,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Abdomen', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of abdomen', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Planning Techniques', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Study Subject', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Weight', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'interest', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'segmentation algorithm', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,556712,-0.012275831386635006
"Enabling the Next Generation of High Performance Pediatric Whole Body MR Imaging Project Abstract Motivation: We aim to develop and implement a new approach to transform pediatric MRI. The ultimate goal is ultra-fast and motion-robust imaging in a dedicated child-friendly environment to enable more children undergo MRI without anesthesia. For those who still require anesthesia, it will be briefer and lighter, and performed in a safer environment. This project leverages a small compact magnet, designed for adult brain MRI, with gradients that enable very fast imaging. With this magnet as an outstanding starting point, we will tailor our deep experience and multiple successes in developing new MRI approaches to high-density receiver coils, fast imaging sequences, and new image reconstruction methods to set a new standard for pediatric MRI. Approach: Although the compact scanner is designed for adult heads, with a 37 cm inner diameter, it can accommodate children under eight to ten years of age to image any body part. To transform this system for ideal pediatric scanning, three development aims will be pursued. The ﬁrst is to enable optimal signal reception. This will be accomplished through creating new receive chain electronics that are matched to the gradient capabilities, for ultra-high bandwidth imaging. This will be coupled to very thin and formed receive arrays that maximize the size of the patient that can be accommodated in the small bore of the scanner. The second aim is to develop methods of obtaining the highest performance out of the system by characterizing and correcting for its imperfections. This will be coupled to a bespoke approach to peripheral nerve stimulation, enabling maximal use of the gradients on each patient. These two developments will then be leveraged for high efﬁciency and motion robust noncartesian scanning. The ﬁnal aim is to develop a full environment and infrastructure that is well suited to pediatric imaging. Patient preparation and acclimation to MRI will be enhanced by virtual reality. Support equipment for anesthesia, new physiological sensors, and a novel child-friendly audiovisual system will be created. Signiﬁcance: The result of this project will be a revolutionary change in the way that MRI is used and per- formed for children. MRI will be more available, cheaper, safer, and have markedly improved image quality. Project Narrative We will leverage the outstanding magnet and gradients of a unique small bore MRI scanner to create a new standard for unprecedented whole-body pediatric MR imaging. We will develop, integrate, and validate a set of technologies speciﬁcally for pediatric imaging. These include ultra-high bandwidth MRI signal reception from thin form-ﬁtting hardware, high-speed image data acquisition and image reconstruction, and environmental support appropriate for children.",Enabling the Next Generation of High Performance Pediatric Whole Body MR Imaging,9944392,U01EB029427,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Acclimatization', 'Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cone', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Flare', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Immersion', 'Infrastructure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Nerve Stimulation', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Support System', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Vendor', 'base', 'commercialization', 'contrast imaging', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pediatric patients', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual reality', 'whole body imaging']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,887058,0.00016143100035943687
"Permeability Imaging using Simultaneous Dynamic PET and Arterial Spin Labeling MRI Abstract Candidate's Career Goals: Dr. Han has a strong background in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, image reconstruction and arterial spin labeling (ASL), with a Ph.D. in bio and brain engineering. Dr. Han is currently at a junior-faculty rank of instructor at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). His goal is to expand his future career to multi-modality positron emission tomography (PET)-MR imaging for translational research and clinical improvement. His long-term goal is to become an independent, accomplished investigator that can lead future scientific and clinical imaging projects taking full advantage of multi-modality PET-MR imaging. Career Development Plan: Foundational training in PET/PET-MR imaging as well as neurology is proposed for the candidate, an area that the candidate currently lacks knowledge and experience in. The candidate plans to engage in formal course work/seminars, research via one-on-one instructions with mentors and collaborators, conferences/presentations, manuscript/grant preparations, and teaching/leadership roles to grow as an independent investigator in the field of PET-MR imaging and neurology. Research Project: The overall goal of the proposed research is to take advantage of simultaneous dynamic PET and ASL-MR imaging to estimate the permeability surface product (PS) of the PET tracer, which is new physiological information that cannot be obtained with PET or MR alone. PS describes the unidirectional flux rate of macromolecules from the blood plasma into the interstitial space of cellular tissue and is the key metric for assessing the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Knowing the PS of the PET tracer provides powerful capability to probe the physiological delivery process of essential macromolecules involved in the pathogenesis of diseases in relation to BBB, due to the theoretically unlimiting potential in the design of radioactive analogs of important biological compounds. We plan to develop a PET tracer PS mapping method, achieve the first phantom and human study with PS mapping, and study the changes in the spatial distribution of tau neurofibrillary tangles (tau) and amyloid-beta (Aß) plaque depositions in relation to the BBB integrity changes with pathological events associated with the progression of AD, by performing dynamic-PET/mPLD-ASL studies using 18F-T807 and 11C- Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET tracers on AD and normal subjects. Environment: MGH provides an ideal setting for conducting research in MR, PET, and PET-MR imaging since multiple state-of-the-art imaging systems are available for preclinical/clinical MR scanners and preclinical simultaneous PET-MR scanners. There is a dynamic flow phantom designed to simulate blood flow for two compartment pharmacokinetics and an MR-compatible pump and detection system for continuous blood sampling suitable for performing ASL flow and PET imaging studies with arterial sampling. Also, there is a shared memory supercomputer ideal for the image reconstruction proposed in the project. MGH is also home to many experts in both PET-MR imaging and neurology who can provide their expertise to this project.
