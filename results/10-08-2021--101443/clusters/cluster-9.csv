"Mobile bedside ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in resource limited settings Project Summary In low and middle-income countries (LMICs) pneumonia is by far the leading cause of death among children < 5 years of age. Despite progress in reducing global pneumonia deaths, pneumonia still kills over 1 million children a year. A key factor is the challenge of pneumonia diagnosis. Chest X-Ray is the gold standard for pneumonia diagnoses but exposes children to ionizing radiation and is mainly restricted to hospital settings. Outside of hospitals, pneumonia is diagnosed based on clinical grounds using the WHO’s Integrated Management of Childhood Illness algorithms. However, that approach lacks specificity, resulting in significant overdiagnosis of pneumonia. That wastes precious resources, exposes children to antibiotics unnecessarily, and delays identification of the true cause of a child’s illness. Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in bedside ultrasound as a radiation-sparing alternative to X- Ray. The accuracy of bedside US for diagnosing pneumonia is comparable to X-Ray. However, traditional bedside US suffers the same limitations as X-Rays in terms of portability, and still requires interpretation of images by a trained radiologist. Recent innovations in ultrasound technology and artificial intelligence applications suggest a possible pathway forward. Bluetooth enabled US transponders that connect to a smart phone or tablet, effectively create a truly portable US suite that can fit into one’s pocket. Similarly, advances in artificial intelligence render possible the automated interpretation of mobile bedside US (mBSUS) images on a smart phone, obviating the need for a radiologist. The twin goals of this project are: 1) to compare the accuracy of the mobile, Bluetooth US system, linked to a cell phone, against the gold standard of Chest X-Ray for diagnosis of pneumonia among children aged 1-59 months; and 2) to apply machine learning algorithms to assist in the identification of accurate classification features that reliably identify lobar pneumonia. If successful, this would be a pivotal first step towards the goal of a truly portable yet still highly accurate approach to the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia that could function autonomously without the need for external evaluation by a skilled radiologist. Such a tool would revolutionize pneumonia case management in resource limited parts of the world and could save the lives of many. Project Narrative Pneumonia remains the leading cause of death for children <5 years around the world. A key barrier is the lack of affordable and portable imaging systems. In this project, we will 1) test the accuracy of a mobile ultrasound system that connects to a smart phone via blue tooth against the gold standard of chest X-Ray, and 2) use machine learning algorithms to automate the diagnosis of pneumonia, thereby obviating the need for external review by a radiologist.",Mobile bedside ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in resource limited settings,9773427,R21TW011343,"['5 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Aorta', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blinded', 'Bluetooth', 'Breast Feeding', 'Breathing', 'Case Management', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest wall structure', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Convulsions', 'Coughing', 'Cyanosis', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Lethargies', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pediatric Radiologist', 'Pleura', 'Pneumococcal Pneumonia', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Regional Anatomy', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Diaphragm', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unconscious State', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vomiting', 'Zambia', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'drinking', 'health training', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'portability', 'radiologist', 'smartphone Application', 'tool', 'wasting']",FIC,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R21,2019,199220,0.008352564480744494
"Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Project summary Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, occur in up to 5% of the population in the United States, and are associated with lifelong disability. There are multiple difficulties in obtaining an accurate diagnosis of FASD, including subtlety of physical features and heterogeneity in presentation. Consequently, FASD is grossly under-recognized, and the majority of affected children never receive a diagnosis. If FASD could be diagnosed earlier and with more reliability, many years of beneficial intervention would not be lost. The objective of this research is to apply machine learning to high-dimensional data in well-characterized data sets to predict or characterize children with FASD. The central hypothesis of this research is that the application of machine learning will accurately predict and recognize FASD compared with expert clinical diagnosis. To test this hypothesis, machine learning will be employed to: 1) characterize FASD based on the presence of non-cardinal malformations, 2) establish multivariate predictors of FASD in preschool aged children, and 3) identify diagnosis specific neurodevelopmental markers that distinguish alcohol related neurodevelopmental deficits from neurodevelopmental deficits without prenatal exposure. Two secondary data sources will be used in this proposal; a prospective study of 400 pregnant women and their offspring in Ukraine (half of whom consumed high amounts of alcohol) with full clinical evaluations for FASD, and a cross- sectional study of over 2,900 first grade children in four regions of the U.S., all with clinical FASD evaluations. Upon successful completion of the proposed research, the expected contribution is for more accurate prediction and recognition of children with FASD. The proposed research is innovative, as it represents a departure from current practice by incorporating machine learning techniques into predictive models of FASD. As a perinatal epidemiologist, I have a strong foundation in analytic techniques, and the advanced training in machine learning will further enhance these skills. Additionally, the disease-focused training in dysmorphology and neurodevelopment will provide a strong foundation to make significant contributions to the field of FASD research. Finally, training and mentoring in grant writing and the responsible conduct of research will provide a strong foundation to transition to an independent researcher. This proposed research builds on previous NIAAA funded research by my interdisciplinary mentoring team, who are all strongly supportive of this research and training plan. This seminal application of machine learning to FASD research will demonstrate its capacity to predict and identify affected children, ultimately leading to earlier intervention of children prenatally exposed to alcohol. Narrative Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are common and result in lifelong disabilities; however, they are clini- cally difficult to identify, and the vast majority of children with FASD are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The proposed research will leverage recent advances in machine learning to better identify children with FASD. These advances would lead to earlier identification and intervention in the lives of children prenatally exposed to alcohol, which can improve their developmental outcomes.",Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure,9805491,K01AA027811,"['Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Nursery Schools', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ukraine', 'United States', 'Writing', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aged', 'alcohol exposure', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'disability', 'fetal diagnosis', 'first grade', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malformation', 'multidimensional data', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel strategies', 'offspring', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'research clinical testing', 'responsible research conduct', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'success']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K01,2019,164791,-0.03147222217797966
"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,9791316,R00ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'random forest', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2019,246653,0.09755816505626665
"Automatic Rib Fracture Detection in Pediatric Radiography to Identify Non-Accidental Trauma ABSTRACT Automatic Rib Fracture Detection in Pediatric Radiography to Identify Non-Accidental Trauma PI: Adam M. Alessio Non-accidental trauma caused by physical abuse is a leading cause of death in children in the United States. Because rib fractures are highly predictive of child abuse and chest radiographs are commonly performed for multiple indications, pediatric chest radiographs can have a critical role in the identification of abuse. Detection of rib fractures on pediatric radiographs is challenging and a high percentage of fractures are missed, particularly in imaging centers with limited pediatric radiology experience. Currently, there are no viable computer assisted strategies for rib fracture detection on chest radiographs. The purpose of this proposal is to develop machine learning methodology to detect rib fractures on pediatric radiographs using images from a network of hospitals. These methods will rely on a two-stage approach including a thoracic cavity segmentation stage followed by a fracture detection stage. We will explore two fracture detection strategies using novel supervised learning approaches: a heterogeneous U-net and a multi-modal regional-convolutional neural network. These methods will be trained and tested with a large set of fracture-absent radiographs (N=1000) from Seattle Children's Hospital and a diverse set of labelled fracture-present radiographs (N=500) from collaborating sites. These methods will be developed with an intentionally diverse set of radiographs, representative of the variety of fracture presentations and image quality in clinical practice, in order to position this rib fracture detection method for rapid translation to clinical practice. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to provide a computer assisted rib fracture assessment tool that would be a rapid and widely-available add-on to all pediatric chest radiograph exams, improving detection of rib fractures and potentially leading to improved identification of child abuse. NARRATIVE Automatic Rib Fracture Detection in Pediatric Radiography to Identify Non-Accidental Trauma PI: Adam M. Alessio Child abuse is a leading cause of death in children and rates of abuse are increasing. Detection of rib fractures on commonly performed chest radiographs has the potential to identify unsuspected child abuse, but it is very challenging to see fractures on these exams. This work proposes a computer assisted strategy to help radiologists detect rib fractures on pediatric chest radiographs, which may lead to improved identification of child abuse.",Automatic Rib Fracture Detection in Pediatric Radiography to Identify Non-Accidental Trauma,9658063,R21HD097609,"['Assessment tool', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Child Abuse', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Fracture', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Injury', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediastinal', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-accidental', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Radiology', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Respiratory Diaphragm', 'Rib Fractures', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Thoracic cavity structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'bone', 'child physical abuse', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'hands-on learning', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'physical abuse', 'radiologist', 'rapid technique', 'rib bone structure', 'soft tissue', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NICHD,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,223004,0.00590062801883482
"Secondary data analysis of universal autism screening in a large primary care network: The impact of early autism screening on age of diagnosis, referral, and entry into intervention (R03) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently highlighted the lack of studies examining universal autism screening in primary care and whether it leads to earlier diagnosis and treatment. This gap prevented them from being able to recommend universal autism screening until there is more evidence. CHOP has successfully implemented universal autism screening in primary care – 83% screening compliance in 2016, and has both screening and follow-up primary care available in the electronic health record. This proposal is for a secondary analysis of this data to directly answer the question of whether universal screening results in earlier identification and earlier treatment entry for children with autism. Preliminary analyses on 13,503 children found the sensitivity of the M-CHAT was surprisingly low -- 40% (specificity 94%, positive predictive value 16%, and negative predictive value of 98%). These results show that, with only one screen, more children with autism screened negative (n=198) than screened positive (n=128). This project will include a sample double this size (as more children age into the 4-6 year age range), and include the wealth of data within the EHR to accomplish two aims. Aim 1 will determine the age of diagnosis and entry into early intervention for children in a universal autism screening program. Many factors contribute to the age of diagnosis and intervention, but this dataset can answer three important questions: First, to determine the age of diagnosis and entry to intervention for children with autism who screened positive as toddlers at the first v. second screen (“true positives”). Second, to determine the age of diagnosis and early intervention for children who screened negative but went on to be diagnosed with autism (“false negatives”), since negative screening results can still lead to heightened awareness of milestones. Third, to explore the age of diagnosis and intervention for screened v. unscreened children, since a subset of children were not screened (approximately 17% of well-child visits, as well as some number of children who received sick care but did not present for well-child visits). Aim 2 will identify factors that would improve screening accuracy, and then create and validate a clinical decision tree. Pediatricians use clinical judgment to interpret screening results—this project can provide much needed evidence. Variables such as autism risk factors (e.g., family history); child demographic, medical, and developmental factors; family variables including socio-economic status and parent concerns; and practice-level variables including patient population demographics, provider years of experience, provider compliance with screening, and provider rates of referrals, could inform clinical judgment. Upon successful completion, this project will contribute the exact type of evidence from universal screening in primary care requested by the USPSTF, as well as provide guidance for pediatricians on how to fine tune their interpretation of screening results. This can significantly impact the age of diagnosis and intervention, by revealing for whom screening is and is not working well. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will analyze existing data from the highly successful universal autism screening program in our large primary care network. Our data can answer critical questions about the age of diagnosis, referral, and entry into intervention for children screened in primary care. We can also determine whether child, family, provider, and practice variables can be used to more accurately interpret early autism screening results.","Secondary data analysis of universal autism screening in a large primary care network: The impact of early autism screening on age of diagnosis, referral, and entry into intervention (R03)",9762199,R03MH116356,"['Academy', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'American', 'Awareness', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Industry Standard', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Philadelphia', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States', 'Visit', 'aged', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'classification trees', 'control trial', 'decision tree learning', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'group intervention', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'patient population', 'pediatrician', 'premature', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'regression trees', 'rural setting', 'screening', 'screening program', 'secondary analysis', 'standard of care', 'urban setting']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R03,2019,86000,-0.008644267181787377
"Genotype-Phenotype Associations in Reading Disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Dyslexia and other language-based reading disorders (RD) account for nearly 85% of children receiving special education services in the U.S. RD affect between 5% and 17% of school-age children with boys at higher risk than girls. Children with RD are at high risk for academic failure and future underemployment. The current diagnosis of RD relies on behavioral symptoms. This means that RD cannot be identified until after the child has begun to learn to read. By this time, a potentially opportune window for intervention has been missed. Early identification and prevention is possible by using genetic markers because RD have a high heritability rate. The existing genetic studies about RD are limited in the sense that the gene-RD association was evaluated on a one-gene-at-a-time basis. This approach is not efficient because hundreds of thousands of genes need to be evaluated; nor is it effective because it runs a high risk of miss-detecting important genes due to overly-strict multiple test corrections applied to too many genes. Also, the existing one-gene-at-a-time approach only examines the marginal association of each gene with RD, without accounting for the joint effect of multiple genes and their interaction in relation to RD. For a complex phenotype like RD, a multi-gene- interactive mechanism is more plausible and has been supported by recent studies. Despite this, little research has been done to discover the genes simultaneously and characterize their interactions. This is partially because this field has not been able to take advantage of modern machine learning developments that provide effective and efficient approaches for genetic big data modeling and analysis. Another limitation of the existing studies is that they have been focused on single behavioral deficits and did not account for demographic difference. The short-term goals for this proposed project are to identify the gene sets associated with RD, link the gene sets to enriched functional biological pathways, characterize the gene-RD associations across the behavioral deficits in multiple reading abilities and accounting for demographic differences, and validate the findings using existing population-based datasets. These goals will be achieved using a combination of advanced machine learning algorithms and pathway analyses that are applied to existing population-based RD data sources. There are two specific aims: Aim 1 focuses on identification of significant genes and their interactions in relation to RD using sparse machine learning models and pathway analysis; Aim 2 focuses on validation for the models and findings in Aim 1 using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) dataset and another independent dataset. The long-term goal of this research is to contribute to the development of personalized early identification methods and early intervention for children at risk of RD. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Children with reading disorders account for up to 17 percent of the school-age population, and are at greater risk for underachievement in school, underemployment, and related mental health problems.

"Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings Abstract Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in low-income countries. In high-income countries, pediatric diarrhea remains a major utilization of healthcare resources. Treatment of diarrhea is mostly empiric, with antibiotic use mostly based on clinical suspicion for bacterial causes. However, the majority of cases of diarrhea do not benefit from antibiotic use, and inappropriate use leads to toxicity and resistance. Furthermore, despite the increasing availability of rapid molecular testing, there is little data to base a decision of whom or when to test. Our overarching goal is to develop and validate clinical decision tools for management of diarrheal illnesses in children of both high and low resource settings. We will utilize prospectively-collected data from two recently-completed multicenter cohort studies of pediatric diarrhea. These studies feature extensive etiologic testing, well-characterized clinical elements, and longitudinal outcome data. We have assembled a team with expertise in pediatric diarrhea, clinical prediction rules, and machine learning methods. In Aim 1, we will use domestic data to develop and validate: a) a score for bacterial etiology, and b) a score for which patients are likely to benefit from further testing. We will derive the scores using data from IMPACT, an NIH-sponsored study of 1200 children from 5 US Emergency Departments, and validate using electronic health records from the Utah Intermountain Health System. In Aim 2, we will use international data to develop and validate: a) a diagnostic score for bacterial etiology, and b) a prognostic score for risk stratification of children who go on to poor outcomes. We will derive the scores using data from GEMS, a study of over 9400 children across 7 low-resource countries, and validate using VIDA study of children in 3 African countries. Completion of the Aims will result in the availability of a number of clinical tools that healthcare workers worldwide can use for evidence-based care of children with diarrhea. Project Narrative Diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The management of childhood diarrhea often depend on what type of pathogen is responsible, but in many cases testing is not affordable or feasible. We propose studies to develop clinical scores to make it easier for healthcare workers to decide how to manage children with diarrhea.",Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings,9695923,R01AI135114,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Africa', 'African', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Case Management', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Enteral', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Income', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sample Size', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Utah', 'Vaccines', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical diagnostics', 'diarrheal disease', 'evidence base', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'microbial', 'molecular diagnostics', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2019,432549,0.02893550821101735
"Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures: Administrative Supplement for U3 Populations Project Summary/Abstract of the PRIME parent award: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are major causes of perinatal mortality and morbidity and have profound consequences for maternal and child health, but it is unclear if and how rates of HDP are changing over time, or whether neighborhood conditions (e.g., racial residential segregation) and air pollution exposure are associated with risk of developing HDP. We use detailed birth records and Bayesian spatial analysis methods to better understand how HDP rates have changed over a 20 year period (1995-2014), whether racial/ethnic disparities in HDP rates have narrowed or widened in this time frame, and if neighborhood racial segregation and air pollution exposure are associated with an individual’s HDP risk.",Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures: Administrative Supplement for U3 Populations,9911827,R01ES028819,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Air Pollution', 'Architecture', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Birth Records', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Geography', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Time', 'Unemployment', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'data resource', 'early childhood', 'health care availability', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'perinatal morbidity', 'pollutant', 'pregnancy disorder', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'segregation', 'social', 'social stress', 'stressor', 'tool', 'web site']",NIEHS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,117375,0.04009057476536242
"A Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Early Childhood Obesity Among WIC Participating Families PROJECT SUMMARY Early childhood obesity continues to be a clinical and public health challenge in the United States; almost a third of children ages 2-to-5 years old are either overweight or obese. Children who are overweight during early childhood are at least 5 times more likely than normal weight children to be overweight/obese as adults. Non- Hispanic blacks (NHB) have double and Hispanics have triple the rates of obesity compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHW) and Asians (10.4%,15.6%, 5.2%, and 5.0%, respectively). Once established, obesity and its comorbid medical conditions are difficult to treat and usually persist throughout adulthood. Thus, preventing its development as early as possible in life is critical to reduce the health care costs associated with obesity- related chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Current evidence suggests that pregnancy, infancy and early childhood may be critical time periods in the development of overweight/obesity throughout the lifespan but many knowledge gaps remain. These gaps include understanding factors that contribute to high risk for excessive weight gain during gestation, infancy and early childhood which may also partially explain differential response to intervention strategies. Moreover, risk for the development of overweight and obesity during these critical developmental periods appear to be increased in children from racial and ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status backgrounds, but there is a paucity of studies in the literature that include these groups. To better understand how early life factors impact the onset of childhood obesity by age 5, this study will utilize data from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program in Miami Dade County (MDC), Florida. Specifically, we will examine the relationship between pregnancy (maternal weight, gestational diabetes, smoking, alcohol/substance use) and early life (initiation, exclusive and duration of breastfeeding, time of introduction to solid food) risk/ protective factors and child body mass index percentile and z score at age 5. Covariates include mother's race/ethnicity, education level and household income. Statistical models will be evaluated using machine learning-cross validation techniques. This approach has not been previously applied to the obesity science to examine pregnancy and early life obesity risk/protective factors. The analyses take advantage of a robust secondary data set that is arguably one of the most diverse in the country; the WIC program currently services almost half of the nation's mothers babies and young children (as does the local program for MDC) who are from predominantly low income and ethnically diverse backgrounds. The findings from this study will inform the development of obesity prevention interventions targeting pregnancy, prenatal and early childhood developmental periods. Project Narrative The proposed research will increase the understanding of pregnancy and early life obesity risk factors and how these factors vary by ethnic group in low income families, addressing a critical gap in the literature. This study will utilize machine learning-cross validation techniques to ensure the external reliability and validity of our statistical models. Study results generated here will inform the development and delivery of pregnancy and early life obesity prevention interventions and actionable recommendations for pediatric and family clinical care delivered to diverse families.",A Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Early Childhood Obesity Among WIC Participating Families,9870787,F31DK116533,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent obesity', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Asians', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Educational Background', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exclusive Breastfeeding', 'Family', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Florida', 'Food', 'Food Supplements', 'Genetic', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health behavior', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Household', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Nursery Schools', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Services', 'Smoke', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'adult obesity', 'clinical care', 'critical developmental period', 'design', 'early childhood', 'early onset', 'ethnic disparity', 'ethnic diversity', 'ethnic minority population', 'federal poverty level', 'feeding', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'lower income families', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal weight', 'minority children', 'mortality', 'obesity development', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'statistics', 'systematic review']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,F31,2019,38616,0.0154050714937341
"Optimizing Usability of the Orally Rehydrate Children at Home Mobile Application - Optimize ORCAH Project Summary/Abstract Acute gastroenteritis (AGE)--infectious diarrhea—is a common condition that is costly in the US and high- mortality in developing nations. The cornerstone of AGE management is oral rehydration therapy (ORT), an evidence-based technique that has saved over 54 million lives in the 50 years since its introduction. The problem we aim to address is ORT’s underuse in developed countries—specifically in the home setting. If widely adopted, ORT could reduce 80% of AGE-related healthcare visits and costs among children, eliminating 1.3 million emergency department visits and $1.5 billion in hospital costs annually. The product of this Phase I proposal is a minimum viable product of a mobile health application (app)--ORCAH (Orally Rehydrate Children at Home)—that guides caregivers of dehydrated children through administering ORT in the home. ORCAH's innovation is in the use of the mobile device's native functions for analytics, database parameters, timers, notifications, and process state—for a novel aim: making ORT accessible in the home setting in developed countries. We hypothesize we will achieve an effectiveness (percentage of ORT tasks completed) of 80%. We will achieve our objective through 3 Aims: Aim 1. Use key informant interviews with card sort testing to explicitly understand subjects’ prioritization of ORT workflow tasks and how to deliver these in a user- centered design interface, and thereby develop the optimal information architecture of ORCAH. Aim 2. Perform cycles of iterative, user-centered design using a synchronous remote platform to optimize the app’s usability. Aim 3. Pilot test ORCAH in a simulation context to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting a trial of the app using synchronous online methods. Based on the impact of ORT in developing settings, the gap presented by the absence of an intervention for improving home ORT use in developing countries, and the match between the key advantages of mobile health apps and the ORT underuse problem, we expect that the ORCAH app will provide a usability-optimized, effective and efficient technology for supporting home ORT delivery that will ultimately allow users to avoid costly and inconvenient ED visits. Objectives for Phase II include trialing ORCAH’s efficacy compared to usual care and further developing ORCAH to include a cloud-based machine learning algorithm that will continuously optimize the parameters of ORT dosing for each user based on patient- generated data and will provide generalizable evidence about ORT dosing. The long-term goals are to further develop the machine-learning functionalities to update best practices for ORT, and to develop ORCAH for developing settings. The market for ORCAH—caregivers of children with AGE—represents a promising commercial potential, as about 57.9 million children in the US experience an AGE episode annually of at least 24 hours duration. Data2Care’s commercialization strategy includes direct business-to-consumer marketing, as well as co-marketing with business partners including after-hours advice centers, rehydration fluid companies and urgent care centers. Project Narrative  Acute gastroenteritis—infectious diarrhea—is a high-mortality condition in developing nations, where a public health intervention called oral rehydration therapy (ORT) has saved over 54 million lives and is considered the cornerstone of management; however, ORT is underused in developed nations including the United States, resulting in an estimated excess of 1.3 million emergency department visits by children and $1.5 billion in hospital costs for children annually. Through developing a mobile health application—ORCAH (Orally Rehydrate Children at Home)—that guides caregivers of dehydrated children through giving ORT in the household setting, we expect that this application will enhance health and reduce illness in the short term by enabling users to avoid costly and inconvenient emergency department visits, and the associated costs. In the long term, through adding a cloud-based machine learning algorithm to ORCAH that will continuously optimize the parameters of ORT dosing for each user based on patient-generated data, we expect to generate generalizable evidence about ORT dosing parameters that will improve the science, delivery and efficacy of ORT.",Optimizing Usability of the Orally Rehydrate Children at Home Mobile Application - Optimize ORCAH,9906781,R41HD101158,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colorado', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diarrhea', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Fostering', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Visit', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Household', 'IV Fluid', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Notification', 'Oral', 'Oral Rehydration Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Engineering', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'User-Computer Interface', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatric trauma', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health intervention', 'recruit', 'simulation', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'urgent care', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,"DATA2CARE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R41,2019,145682,0.019167889049348828
"Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Project Summary: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Environmental exposure mixtures, especially when coupled with social stressors, have the potential to compromise developmental outcomes in children, but have been understudied. We will use a unique longitudinal dataset that tracks children from birth through early elementary school, in combination with new tools from modern data science, to disentangle the complex effects of these mixtures on educational outcomes.",Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures,9626424,R01ES028819,"['Address', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Architecture', 'Bayesian Method', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Factors', 'Birth', 'Birth Records', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Censuses', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Cox Models', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Gaussian model', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mothers', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nitrogen Dioxide', 'North Carolina', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Ozone', 'Particle Size', 'Particulate Matter', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pollution', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Shapes', 'Siblings', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Sulfur Dioxide', 'System', 'Taxes', 'Time', 'Unemployment', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deprivation', 'early childhood', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health care availability', 'indexing', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'pollutant', 'programs', 'rural environment', 'simulation', 'social', 'social stress', 'stressor', 'tool', 'web site']",NIEHS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,499515,0.039032875406901174
"Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development ABSTRACT This proposal will develop innovative technology for data-driven, multimodal characterization of nonverbal communication (NVC) in typical and atypical development. Prior research has provided qualitative descriptions of the development of children's use of gaze and gesture to regulate social interactions, but there are no objective, automated tools for measuring NVC behaviors, nor computational models to explain their coordination and timing in social interactions. This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children in the US. This project is focused on developing automated tools to characterize behaviors considered to be core, early emerging markers of autism, and that represent common treatment targets in this group. This has clear implications for identifying those at risk for autism and for ongoing clinical care.",Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development,9750288,R01MH114999,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Client', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Posture', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'clinical care', 'common treatment', 'communication behavior', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gaze', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovative technologies', 'joint attention', 'language outcome', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social communication', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,354625,-0.052343983852526456
"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. The proposed program will apply a novel dental biomarker of exposure to multiple chemicals and cutting-edge statistical methods to identify specific life stages including perinatal periods that correspond to increased susceptibility to neurodevelopmental effects of metal toxicant mixtures.",Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture,9767585,R01ES026033,"['8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Arsenic', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cadmium', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Nutrient', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deciduous tooth', 'developmental neurotoxicity', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'perinatal period', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,608605,0.06104793966156467
"Computational Models for the Prediction and Prevention of Child Traumatic Stress - Resubmission - 1 Project Summary/Abstract At least 40% of children will experience a traumatic event. Of those who experience a trauma, 15-40% will develop Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and other adverse psychiatric, health, and functional outcomes (herein called Child Traumatic Stress - CTS). Despite decades of research on risk factors for CTS, the field has not arrived at specific risk factor models that can accurately predict the likelihood of CTS outcomes or identify factors that – if changed – would change their likelihood. Knowledge about changes in factors that result in changes in outcomes is, by definition, causal. The vast majority of findings in the literature on risk for CTS cannot provide such causal knowledge because such findings were based on the application of correlational methods to observational data. Experimental research cannot – for all practical purposes - be conducted for human research on risk for CTS. Thus, the field is left with correlational observational research as the near exclusive generator of empirical knowledge on risk for CTS, and such knowledge is unsuitable to guide the actions (i.e. interventions) that must be taken to change children's likelihood of acquiring CTS outcomes. We propose to address this considerable barrier to progress by applying methods that can enable confident causal inference with large observational data sets containing a broad diversity of risk variables for CTS. Machine Learning (ML) predictive and causal modeling methods will be applied to discover causal relationships among measured variables from observational data: and from such determined causal relationships, to estimate the effect on a CTS outcome when a causal variable is manipulated (i.e. intervention simulation). We will build models for outcomes associated with childhood trauma in the literature and that entail significant burden to children's well-being, functioning, and development: PTSD, Depression, Substance Abuse, Health, and Educational Performance. Project Narrative This application proposes research to apply an array of powerful and innovative computational methods – well validated in other fields – to advance the capacity to predict and prevent traumatic stress in children and adolescents. These methods will be applied to several highly relevant, existing data sets that cover diverse populations of traumatized youth and with diverse data collection designs. The data sets and the analytic methodologies have been carefully selected to advance knowledge related to prediction, discovery of causal mechanisms, and the identification of promising preventative interventions for child traumatic stress.",Computational Models for the Prediction and Prevention of Child Traumatic Stress - Resubmission - 1,9885086,R01MH119114,"['18 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Child Welfare', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Stress', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Youth', 'base', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'social', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'traumatized children']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,781926,0.016110771009354586
"Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development Project Summary/Abstract Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include multiple classes of chemicals that have been used extensively in consumer products. Mounting evidence from toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest EDCs are developmental neurotoxicants, and EDC exposure during the critical in utero period is associated with adverse child cognitive development. Unfortunately, current research focuses on individual EDCs and largely ignores joint and interactive effects of EDCs and the overall effect of the EDC mixture. To assess exposure to multiple EDCs simultaneously, one must consider the high dimensionality of the exposure matrix and the complex correlation structures across chemicals in statistical analyses. To address limitations of existing methods, we propose to adapt a robust technique that is well-established for pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We specifically aim to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a type of robust Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization, to determine the patterns of exposure to four ubiquitous classes of EDCs known to cross the placenta—polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols (e.g., bisphenol A), and phthalates—and to characterize the relationship between these exposure patterns and cognitive development. LDA is empirically-driven so that the researcher does not need to specify a priori the number of patterns, and the non-negativity constraint enhances the interpretability of the patterns identified. For our health model, we will use a supervised approach that allows child cognitive scores to inform the LDA solution, thereby enabling identification of patterns most relevant to the outcome. We will conduct this work using the existing infrastructure of the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study, a longitudinal birth cohort of mother-child dyads. We will also establish reproducibility of the method by creating a user-friendly R package so that other researchers can easily apply LDA in environmental epidemiology, and we will verify transferability and functionality of the method on a separate cohort. This will be the first study to assess the interacting and overall effects of multiple EDCs on child cognitive development, introducing LDA as a straight-forward tool for the analysis of complex mixtures in epidemiology. If successful, this method has broader implications for environmental epidemiology, as it can easily be applied to other environmental mixtures of interest. The activities encompassed by this proposal (study design, data management, advanced statistics, machine learning, data science, and presentation of findings) cover the set of fundamental research skills required by a scientist entering the interdisciplinary field of environmental epidemiology in the era of Big Data and Precision Public Health. The applied experience gained from carrying out this research, in combination with didactic training and individual cross-disciplinary mentoring, comprises a comprehensive research training plan that will serve as a platform from which to launch a career as an independent investigator in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative This study will be the first to determine existing patterns of cross-class endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure in utero and to evaluate their association with child cognitive development, assessing potentially non- linear independent effects, non-additive interactions, and the overall effect of the mixture. This will help to identify environmental risk factors most amenable to public health interventions and inform future researchers and policy makers about concurrent exposure to EDCs in a vulnerable population The adaptation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for pattern identification and dimension reduction in environmental epidemiology integrates data science and machine learning into environmental health research, which is novel and extremely relevant to public health, as LDA can be easily applied to other environmental mixtures and co-exposures of interest.",Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development,9681837,F31ES030263,"['Address', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cosmetics', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Flame Retardants', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Paint', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenols', 'Placenta', 'Plastics', 'Policy Maker', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Urine', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'bisphenol A', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'consumer product', 'data management', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fundamental research', 'health of the mother', 'high dimensionality', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'modifiable risk', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'pollutant', 'polybrominated diphenyl ether', 'prenatal exposure', 'public health intervention', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2019,31591,0.06149850376155323
"Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design Patients, clinicians, and policymakers often need valid information about the real-world effects of drugs and other exposures for which there have been pronounced time-trends in use. For example, the rapid growth in the use of rofecoxib in the early 2000s and of exogenous testosterone from 2000–2013 was accompanied by an urgent need for knowledge about the cardiovascular effects of those drugs. Randomized trials seldom enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or follow them long enough, to examine associations with rare outcomes. Therefore, non-randomized studies are needed, even though they are susceptible to unmeasured confounding and other forms of bias. To address these limitations of available epidemiologic designs, we recently introduced the trend-in-trend design: a novel, hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic research design that is applicable when there is a prominent trend in the use of the study exposure. Substantial additional development is needed to realize the full public health impact of the trend-in-trend research design. Areas in most need of development include: evaluation of a sequential analysis extension for real-time post-marketing safety surveillance; evaluation of machine learning to specify the trend-in-trend design’s underlying cumulative probability of exposure model; evaluation of dose-response relationships; and evaluation of treatment effect heterogeneity based on baseline patient characteristics. For each of these methodologic needs, we propose an approach for which we will: 1) assess its statistical properties, in particular large-sample validity through asymptotics and finite sample statistical power; 2) evaluate its performance in thorough simulation studies; and 3) proof-test the approach using the known association between rofecoxib-acute myocardial infarction in healthcare data. Finally, we will apply these developments to the unresolved and highly important question of the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic effects of exogenous testosterone in men. This study will have broad scientific, clinical, and public health impact by greatly extending the utility of a novel epidemiologic research design with demonstrated validity and is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. It will also evaluate the safety of exogenous testosterone, a question of tremendous clinical and public health importance. Examining the safety of prescription drugs is one enormously important application of this design that has the potential to benefit many millions of people. As the trend-in-trend design is also applicable to non-drug exposures that have a pronounced time-trend (e.g., medical procedures, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, etc.), its potential impact on the population is even broader. This project will enhance the utility of the trend-in-trend research design, a novel hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic design that is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. Further, we will leverage these methods developments to study the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic safety of exogenous testosterone, unanswered questions of tremendous clinical and public health importance for older adult males.",Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design,9813026,R01AG064589,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Calendar', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Research Design', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Observational Study', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Research Design', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'To specify', 'Venous', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'base', 'cerebrovascular', 'cohort', 'cyclooxygenase 2', 'design', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'male', 'men', 'method development', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'population health', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'simulation', 'time use', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'trend analysis']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,531144,0.004257986999708175
"Spatiotemporal Risk Assessment Modeling of Chemical Mixtures Project Summary: Comprehensive exposure assessments that account for mixtures of environmental chemical pollutants are vital to understand true relationships between human exposures and disease outcomes. Moreover, human or daily mobility of people is often misrepresented by exposure models resulting in exposure misclassification. This proposal aims to determine how air pollution chemical mixtures and human mobility impact environmental and human health risk assessments, which aligns with the NIEHS core mission “to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives.” The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling. The primary mentor, Dr. Kim Anderson, a professor at Oregon State University is an expert in passive exposure assessment methods and analytical quantification of chemical mixtures in environmental media, which provides an excellent environment to transition the candidate from a background in single-pollutant exposure assessment to multi-pollutant mixture exposure and risk assessment. Along with new teaching opportunities, the candidate will receive training from Dr. Anderson in research methods such as primary data collection, biochemical monitoring for epidemiological studies, and toxicology approaches in risk assessment. Collaborators Drs. Katrina Waters and Justin Teeguarden, senior scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, will provide career development advising and research training in areas such as data integration for epidemiology and toxicology studies and hands-on experience with large-scale computational resources. This proposal’s aims will address the following central hypotheses: (1) Accounting for chemical mixtures in exposure will produce synergistic health effects not observed by chemicals individually, and (2) Personal sampling and model-based exposure assessment accounting for human mobility will produce varying risk estimates depending on the pollutant and individuals’ mobility. During the K99 phase, aim 1 will collect multi-chemical air quality data for a daily time resolved stationary monitoring campaign resulting in a space and time resolved multi-pollutant (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds) air quality dataset. Aim 2 will develop spatiotemporal exposure models for gas-phase mixtures using land use regression, geostatistical, and machine learning models. In the R00 phase, aim 3 will perform a risk assessment for chemical mixtures and acute lung health effects accounting for human mobility using a case-crossover design and comparing three exposure assessment methods: traditional spatiotemporal models, spatiotemporal models accounting for human mobility, and personal exposure monitors. Together, this proposal addresses the major limitations in environmental exposure assessment, pollutant mixtures and human mobility, and is within the mixtures and air pollution focus areas of environmental exposure research at NIEHS. Project Narrative The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling. This study will validate spatiotemporal statistical approaches in chemical mixture exposure modelling, evaluate the cumulative effects of chemical mixtures in air pollution and acute lung health effects, and determine the extent of exposure misclassification due to human mobility.

"Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease Project Summary Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 2.4 billion episodes of illness and 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in adults, adolescents, and children over five years. As the severity of diarrheal diseases can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While patients with severe dehydration require hospital admission and immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, those with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated in outpatient settings with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution. Yet, while several tools have been validated for use in children under five years of age, no clinical diagnostic tool has ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Differences in both adult physiology and diarrhea etiology may compromise the accuracy of clinical diagnostic models developed for use in young children. The proposed research will derive the very first age-specific clinical diagnostic models created for the assessment of dehydration status in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea, incorporate those models into a new mobile health (mHealth) tool, and validate the performance of this tool in a new population of patients with acute diarrhea. To accomplish this task, we will enroll a prospective cohort of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea presenting to the rehydration unit of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Dhaka, Bangladesh and collect data on presenting clinical signs and symptoms shown to correlate with dehydration severity in prior studies. We will then employ machine learning techniques to derive age-specific clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea. We will conduct formative research among clinicians working at icddr,b to develop an innovative mobile phone based platform which will incorporate these new age-specific diagnostic models for rapid use by frontline health workers. Finally, we will validate both the accuracy and reliability of the newly developed mHealth tool in a new population of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Once developed and properly validated, this novel mHealth tool has the potential to help physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers more accurately diagnose dehydration severity and better determine the optimal management strategy for patients with acute diarrhea. Improved diagnostic approaches may in turn be shown to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration. Project Narrative Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases remains a leading cause of death in both children and adults worldwide, yet no clinical tools have ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. The proposed research will both develop and validate an innovative new mobile phone based platform for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents, and older children with acute diarrhea. This new mobile health tool will help physicians, nurses, and other providers worldwide to determine the best management strategies for patients with acute diarrhea, potentially improving and rationalizing care for the hundreds of millions of patients each year presenting to healthcare facilities around the world with acute diarrhea.",Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease,9771462,R01DK116163,"['5 year old', 'Acute Diarrhea', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bangladesh', 'Beds', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'IV Fluid', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'International Unit', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort', 'Provider', 'Rehydration Solutions', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diarrheal disease', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'international center', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2019,556605,0.011358681559477325
"Longitudinal Study of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Markers of Tourette Syndrome in Children PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic tic disorders (referred to here as Tourette syndrome: TS) are complex and often serious neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by motor and/or vocal tics. Tics are brief, repetitive, unwanted movements or noises, which can severely impinge upon quality of life. While TS was once thought to be relatively rare, recent epidemiological studies find that 1-6% of all children meet criteria for a chronic tic disorder, making it a significant public health problem. Typically in TS, tics begin around age 5-7 years old, peak in severity around age 10-12 years, and improve throughout adolescence into adulthood. However, not all patients show this improvement during adolescence, as ~30% continue to experience significant impairment into adulthood. Thus, the years during and immediately following peak symptom severity represent a critical time for TS, during which individuals may show considerable improvement or not. Surprisingly little research has targeted this critical developmental stage of TS. Moreover, longitudinal investigations of predictors of TS outcome have focused primarily on single variables (e.g., caudate nucleus volume or tic severity). Yet there is considerable evidence that the neurobiology of TS is quite complex, involving interactions within and between multiple brain networks. For example, our preliminary findings demonstrate stronger brain functional connectivity among cognitive control networks and motor networks, as well as altered white and gray matter volumes in prefrontal and subcortical regions in TS. Using this complex information may be more informative for understanding tic severity changes and predicting clinical outcome. We propose a longitudinal study in which we will capture the developmental stage of TS with the greatest likelihood of change in tic severity (beginning at age 10-12 years), and will follow these children to track the development of brain and cognitive features, and how they relate to symptom change, over time. To capture the complex neurobiology of TS, we will collect whole-brain resting state functional connectivity, structural MRI, cognitive, and clinical data from a group of children with TS. We will compare these children to tic-free controls (from the NIH's ABCD Study Washington University site subject pool), as comparison to typical development will be essential for interpreting longitudinal changes in TS. We will target diagnostic differences and developmental changes in specific functional brain networks, regional brain volumes, and cognitive abilities. We will also use multivariate machine learning methods to unify this rich dataset to classify and make predictions about individual children. This approach analyzes complex patterns of multidimensional data rather than single variables, providing the potential for clinical utility and to contribute converging evidence about mechanism. Identifying mechanisms underlying symptom change will provide insight into why many children with TS improve while some do not, potentially yielding new targets for treatment and predictive indicators of persistent tics. Markers of symptom improvement could be targeted to treat children who do not improve. Being able to make predictions about individual children could identify those children who need those interventions most. We have expertise with every step of the proposed study, but the application to longitudinal data over the first half of the second decade of life is novel. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with Tourette syndrome (TS) follow varying clinical courses, as some will experience substantial improvement over the course of adolescence while others will continue to experience significant impairment. Understanding the brain and cognitive features that mediate or predict different outcomes could revolutionize prognosis and treatment. This project will study children with and without TS over time, during the key ages of 10 to 14 years, to (1) investigate how brain and cognitive markers of TS develop over adolescence and relate to changes in symptom severity, and (2) make predictions about future symptom severity for individual children.",Longitudinal Study of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Markers of Tourette Syndrome in Children,9818160,R01MH118217,"['12 year old', '7 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Tics', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocal Tics', 'Washington', 'base', 'brain volume', 'caudate nucleus', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'putamen', 'symptomatic improvement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,784433,0.02587016534207975
"Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health Project Summary  Decades of research suggest that neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage increases children's health risk. This proposed project seeks to address two major weaknesses in conventional neighborhood effects research and interventions: a) the assumption that residential neighborhoods function independently of each other - ignoring that risk factors in areas where people work, learn, and play away from home may interact with residential factors; and b) as importantly, insufficient understanding of neighborhood effects mechanisms and heterogeneity in effects. To systematically address these critical barriers in the field, I propose a research and training program that will enable me to learn, use, and adapt recent advancements in Big Data analytics. I plan to model hidden interdependencies among individuals and neighborhoods and operationalize mechanisms of neighborhood effects by drawing on multiple large datasets (demographic, geospatial, networks, population flows), with several hundred million observations across multiple states, cities, and years, and match them to locally and nationally representative restricted survey data. The massive volume, great variety, and unique complexity of such data, such as relational data on inter-neighborhood dependencies and interactions, pose a challenge to the standard capabilities of hardware, algorithms, and analytical methods and models of social and population science. The proposed training program in Big Data analytics and machine learning will enable me to overcome computational and conceptual challenges and uniquely position me to: a) examine the ecological inter-neighborhood networks (econetworks) to which population groups are differentially exposed to across space and time; and b) test new contextual mechanisms underlying children's exposures to health risks. Specifically, I propose to: a) develop computational models of dynamic large scale econetworks to assess population differences in exposures to health risk factors, as they commute daily between home and workplaces; b) examine heterogeneity in econetwork effects on child health using a hybrid design that links Big Data to local and national surveys; and c) model child health risk mechanisms and causal effects using natural experiments on Big Data. The proposed training program will enable me to learn and adapt Big Data analytics, draw on its strengths, but also address some of its key limitations. With the support of a unique team of distinguished mentors and advisors, established experts in Big Data analytics, spatial demography, network analysis, child development and health risk, neighborhood change, and population heterogeneity, I will embark on a training program that will uniquely enable me to address these research goals and position me to become an independent scholar and a leader in the field. Project Narrative This project contributes to advancing public health scholarship by leveraging and adapting Big Data analytical tools to overcome critical barriers in the field related to conventional assumptions about effects of neighborhood risk exposures on child health. It addresses the need to understand and model inter- neighborhood interdependencies and underlying multidimensional social capital mechanisms in order to better understand population heterogeneity in neighborhood effects on child health across space and time. The project also advances public health through an integration of rigorous social and data science methodology to create new measures and test causal hypotheses that advance our understanding of social capital forces that foster resilience to adversity and improve child health behavior and outcomes.",Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health,9767837,K01HD093863,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Businesses', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Child Rearing', 'Cities', 'Collaborations', 'Commuting', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Demography', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Drug usage', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health behavior outcomes', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Surveys', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'Social Work', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress and Coping', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'boys', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'low socioeconomic status', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'population health', 'programs', 'resilience', 'social capital', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'theories', 'violence exposure']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,K01,2019,138258,0.024586087000802476
"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.",The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders,9717307,R01MH104030,"['Advertisements', 'Age', 'Anniversary', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family history of', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuropsychology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'brain abnormalities', 'caudate nucleus', 'comparison group', 'critical period', 'dexterity', 'follow-up', 'habit learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical attention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomenological models', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'secondary analysis', 'vector']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,683541,0.043536355798403176
"Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia Reading instruction prompts the emergence of neural circuits that are specialized for rapidly translating printed symbols into sound and meaning. Understanding how these circuits differ in children with dyslexia, and change with learning, is an important scientific challenge that holds practical implications for education. The proposed research employs longitudinal measurements in children with dyslexia over the course of a highly effective intervention program to: (a) determine how brain structure and function change in response to reading instruction; and (b) investigate neurobiological factors that predispose a child to struggle or succeed in the intervention. Thus, this proposal seeks to determine both how education shapes brain development, and how a child’s unique neurobiology predicts educational outcomes. Aim 1) White matter plasticity and learning – White matter was previously considered static infrastructure; it is now known that many cellular properties of the white matter change with learning. Reading interventions provide a powerful tool to study experience-dependent plasticity in the human brain. Based on novel quantitative MRI and diffusion MRI measurements developed by the PI and collaborators, it is now possible to quantify changes in cell density, intra-axonal water and myelination at millimeter resolution. Longitudinal measurements collected before, during, and after the intervention will be used to model the time-course of white matter plasticity associated with improvements in reading skills, and investigate the biological mechanisms that underlie differences in learning among children. Aim 2) Bottom-up and top-down computations in the reading circuit - When our eyes fixate upon a word, a cascade of neural processes is initiated, beginning in the visual system and progressing through a series of computations that translate the visual representation into sound and meaning. We have developed the first model of the neural computations performed by critical components of the brain’s reading circuitry. Based on this new understanding of computations in the literate adult brain, we will investigate how computations differ in children with dyslexia, and change in response to reading instruction. Aim 3) Neural biomarkers of learning outcomes - Even in a controlled and intensive learning environment, some children show substantial improvements in reading skill, while others show limited change. What biological factors predispose a child to excel or struggle when provided a high-quality intervention? Pre- intervention MRI measurements will be examined as predictor variables for individual differences in intervention learning rate, and long-term, post-intervention outcomes. Aim 3 will capitalize machine learning to develop a model of the neuroanatomical factors that predict learning outcomes. Dyslexia, an impairment in accurate or fluent word recognition, is the most common learning disability affecting roughly ten percent of children. This proposal capitalizes on cutting edge neuroimaging methods, in combination with carefully controlled educational interventions and behavioral measurements, to generate a new understanding of how successful intervention shapes the development of the brain circuits that support skilled reading. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms of successful remediation of dyslexia, and individual differences in learning, will pave the way for personalized approaches to dyslexia treatment.",Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia,9815781,R01HD095861,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cell Density', 'Child', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Eye', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Myelin Sheath', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Water', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain remodeling', 'brain shape', 'cognitive task', 'density', 'educational atmosphere', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'intervention program', 'learning outcome', 'literate', 'millimeter', 'mouse model', 'myelination', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'phonology', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'successful intervention', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,535853,0.01274637037744899
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9747247,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,682492,0.008551337885397612
"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining sophisitcated data-analysis methods that use experiential and phenotypic heterogeneity together with longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral assessments in school-age children. This approach will increase precision when linking ECAs and child outcomes associated with the Research Domain Criteria constructs of Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS). The overarching goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the heterogeneous impact of ECAs on neurodevelopmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. This project's premise is that children exposed to ECAs have highly heterogeneous developmental histories as well as heterogeneous outcomes; therefore, prediction of ECA outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-driven approaches will 1) more precisely define NVS/CCS outcomes for school-aged children with ECAs, and 2) provide a more robust explanatory model for links between ECAs and NVS/CCS trajectories. Aim 1A subtypes children with a history of ECAs based on 2.5-year developmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. 300 6-8 year old children (250 sampled from previous institutional and foster care; 50 community comparisons) will provide neuroimaging, behavioral, and self/caregiver reports every 15 months for 2.5 years. Biclustering methods will be applied to the baseline and follow-up data to identify homogeneous NVS/CCS final outcome clusters of children. Aim 1B develops an explanatory model to predict developmental trajectory subtypes for children with ECAs, from early life profiles and brain/behavior phenotypes at the time of enrollment. Machine learning methods applied to early life profiles, baseline NVS/CCS profiles, and sex, will predict developmental trajectory subtypes. Aim 2 identifies adverse and protective life events during the 2.5-year assessment period that are predictive of 2.5-year follow-up outcomes for children with ECAs. The inclusion of child-sex and current life- events will identify potential divergence in pathways across middle childhood. This prospective design of children exposed to various ECAs is designed to develop predictive models for ECA trajectory subtypes and outcomes, which can inform our understanding of risk and protective factors in accord with the goals of precision medicine.   Project Narrative Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology, and it is estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining longitudinal multimodal brain imaging and high- dimensional behavioral assessments in school-age children together with sophisticated data analytic techniques to increase precision when linking heterogeneous ECAs and child outcome with the goal of predicting mental health outcomes and identifying children who would benefit most from specific early interventions.  ",Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities,9731666,R01MH091864,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Orphanages', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'caregiving', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'foster care', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'middle childhood', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prepuberty', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'violence exposure']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2019,736672,0.0635301968414171
"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9731643,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'sociodemographics', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,631649,0.010523182201512713
"Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED) PROJECT SUMMARY In this application, I am requesting support from a career development award to support my research proposal titled “Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction”. I will be undertaking this work with the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Gordon (Primary US mentor) at the Washington University, St Louis and Dr. Asad Ali (Primary LMIC mentor) at the Aga Khan University. This project builds on our existing studies of Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED), funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The current application aims to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of EED by studying the evolution of gut microbial configuration in children who have clinical and histological evidence of EED. EED is common in children living in impoverished conditions with limited access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Histopathological changes of EED in small bowel mucosa include alteration in crypt to villous ratio along with lymphocytic infiltration of the villous epithelium and lamina propria. Although studies involving biopsies of small bowel mucosa are critical to study EED, these studies are uncommon because of logistic challenges involving performing endoscopies in field settings in LMICs. We have previously demonstrated in an ongoing BMGF funded study that we are able to safely obtain such biopsies, we now have a unique opportunity to study the relationship between gut microbiome evolution and EED in this cohort. The central hypothesis of the current application is that children with histological confirmation of EED have shared features of a bacterial community which is different from healthy controls and non-EED subjects, and that such changes in bacterial configuration are associated with enteric and systemic inflammation. For testing these hypotheses, evaluation of gut microbiome in healthy and stunted children will be carried out to identify the age discriminatory bacterial taxa in children with and without confirmation of EED. Dr. Gordon will be providing mentorship and experience in gut microbiome and microbiota analysis. Dr. Ali will provide the needed infrastructure of the field site and laboratory facilities, along with linking the microbiome analysis with clinical and histological outcomes of interest. The Aga Khan University is a leading regional research institute with multiple support systems for junior investigators which will be vital for my career transition as an independent scientist. My long term goal is to be the principal investigator of my own laboratory, focusing on studying the gut microbiome and its relationship with communicable and non-communicable diseases. I envision working on microbiota derived therapy for EED, and to find targets in the inflammatory pathways driven by changes in gut homeostasis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Globally, Pakistan has the third highest rate of stunting among children aged < 5 years. Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) is proposed to be a critical factor responsible for chronic growth faltering in children in resource limited settings. This research utilizes an innovative approach to study a program of postnatal gut microbiome development in children and its impact on child growth. This proposal will provide an ideal training platform for a translational scientist, covering the domains of mucosal immunology, histopathology, computational analysis, microbiome analysis and host immune responses. The skills learnt from this project will be critical for the capacity development of both the LMIC institution and the candidate herself.","Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED)",9712985,K43TW010697,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Duodenum', 'Endoscopy', 'Enteral', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Gut Mucosa', 'Height', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Homeostasis', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lamina Propria', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Small Intestines', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Sustainable Development', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Villous', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aged', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'drinking water', 'enteric pathogen', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'fecal microbiota', 'global health', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'host microbiome', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intestinal villi', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiota', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'skills', 'translational scientist']",FIC,AGA KHAN UNIVERSITY (PAKISTAN),K43,2019,64933,0.045209361799929716
"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution health effects on asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome parameters in especially vulnerable minority children populations.",Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework,9884859,R00ES027511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'African American', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'American', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'European', 'Exposure to', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Future', 'GALA', 'Genetic', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Latino', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Puerto Rican', 'Randomized', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'adverse outcome', 'analog', 'base', 'career', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic difference', 'experience', 'exposure pathway', 'health disparity', 'interest', 'minority children', 'pollutant', 'public health intervention', 'pulmonary function', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'social disparities', 'social vulnerability', 'tool']",NIEHS,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,249000,0.005263458999385762
"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett).

"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett).

"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9774005,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Buprenorphine', 'Calcarine Sulcus', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methadone', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual attention', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive ability', 'critical period', 'drug of abuse', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal drug exposure', 'fetal opioid exposure', 'illicit opioid', 'imaging modality', 'in utero', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'joint attention', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'motor control', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid use', 'opioid use in pregnancy', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prescription opioid', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'standard of care', 'visual control', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,702420,0.021626876783453663
"Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children Maternal substance use disorders are a substantial public health concern and the neurological consequences of prenatal exposure are a major threat to the long-term health of offspring. Globally, prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is between 2-7 and 20-50 per 1000, respectively. By contrast, in certain high-risk communities in South Africa, prevalence is reported to be as high as 63 and 155 per 1000, respectively. Though prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to affect the central nervous system, to date, little data exists in respect of the impact of PAE in early childhood, before both higher-level brain networks are established and other potentially confounding post- natal environmental influences have come into play. For neurodevelopmental disorders, studies have consistently shown that early intervention, based on detection and targeted interventions, leads to better long-term outcomes. We aim to address this precise gap in knowledge by imaging the brain and 3D face across the FASD continuum to investigate early biomarkers, trajectories and functional correlates of PAE in a cohort followed prospectively from birth to age 6 years. Data: Our cohort includes a well characterized subsample of children (PAE and healthy controls) enrolled in the Drakenstein Child Health Study in Cape Town, South Africa, who have been scanned as neonates and at 2-3 years of age. Preliminary published data shows highly significant relationships between PAE and regional gray and white matter changes, already discernible in newborns, well before the age FASD is typically diagnosed. An additional longitudinal assessment at 6-years will yield a unique FASD sample with 3 distinct time points (infants, toddlers and children), allowing characterization of brain and face morphology and brain structure and function in this previously understudied early developmental period. This proposal addresses fundamental gaps concerning the presence, timing and regional specificity of altered brain morphology and structural and functional connectivity in association with the effects of PAE on the developing brain from birth to 6 years, and the relationships with facial dysmorphology. The research team has successfully gathered data from the proposed cohort as neonates and at 2–3 years of age. The benefits of extending this research to a subsequent imaging time-point, with a larger range of developmental and neurobehavioral assessments, provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine longitudinal effects of PAE on the trajectory of the developing brain in these critical early years, the links between neural and face predictors of PAE and the long-term clinical significance of these findings. This research will illuminate early neurodevelopmental mechanisms leading to subsequent behavioral and neurological disturbances, which may allow opportunities for targeting interventions when brain plasticity is still relatively fluid. This project might also lead to new strategies for early diagnosis using both face and brain biomarkers. Project Narrative Fetal exposure of the brain to alcohol can trigger brain abnormalities that unfold over a lifetime with severe consequences both for the affected individual and for society at large. To date, these brain abnormalities and associated deficits and behaviors have mostly been studied in late childhood or later, with very few studies following the consequences of well documented fetal alcohol exposure as they develop in the same individual across time in early childhood when the brain is most responsive to potential treatments. This project will extend an ongoing study of children with fetal alcohol exposure, already characterized as newborns and at age 2-3 to add assessments of the brain and behavior at age 6 and will explore alcohol-induced facial abnormalities as a complementary predictor of brain problems. !",Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children,9788191,R01AA026834,"['2 year old', '3 year old', '3-Dimensional', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neonatal', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'alcohol exposure', 'antenatal', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'efficacy testing', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal alcohol use', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal depression', 'multimodality', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal exposure', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'shape analysis', 'statistics', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,498954,-0.021150541473227428
"Automated point-of-care identification of innocent Still's murmur in children PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of the proposed research and technology transfer effort is to develop a low-cost, point-of-care, mobile device-based technology for automated identification of Still's murmur, the most common innocent (benign and harmless) heart murmur of childhood. This novel technology could reduce the current rate of over half a million children unnecessarily referred to pediatric cardiologists by primary care providers each year in the United States. In Phase I, AusculTech Dx and Children's National Medical Center developed a machine-learning algorithm capable of identifying Still's murmur with high accuracy (90% sensitivity, 99% specificity). To enable digital recording, essential for computerized murmur analysis, we also developed a digital stethoscope that connects to a smartphone and is equivalent in performance to a commercial stethoscope. Our envisioned product, called StethAid, is a combination of this novel digital stethoscope and a smartphone application (app). Having successfully met the Phase I performance milestones, we now propose to fully develop StethAid and conduct a multicenter trial through the following three specific aims: (1) develop and test a clinical-grade digital stethoscope, (2) develop fully feature software app, (3) conduct a multicenter trial of automated Still's murmur identification. For the multicenter trial, we have expanded our collaboration to include Boston Children's Hospital and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Our deliverable for Phase II is a technology platform validated by leading pediatric cardiologists that is ready for seeking regulatory approvals, deployment at PCP offices, and commercialization. As a decision support system, StethAid could empower PCPs to identify Still's murmur accurately and thus reduce the huge number of unnecessary specialist referrals. This should save the healthcare system hundreds of millions of dollars annually, allow pediatric cardiologists to focus on patients with serious conditions, and protect healthy children and their families from the unnecessary anxiety, inconvenience, and expense of seeing a pediatric cardiologist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over half a million children are referred unnecessarily to pediatric cardiologists by general physicians for the evaluation of Still's murmur, a normal and harmless heart murmur. This project will develop and clinically validate a novel mobile technology for automated recognition of this murmur in order to reduce the current rate of such unnecessary referrals and associated costs and inconvenience.",Automated point-of-care identification of innocent Still's murmur in children,9680749,R42HL131081,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Apple', 'Benign', 'Bluetooth', 'Boston', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Sounds', 'Heart murmur', 'Incidence', 'Legal patent', 'Libraries', 'Medical center', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Stethoscopes', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'pediatric cardiologist', 'performance tests', 'point of care', 'prototype', 'smartphone Application', 'sound', 'tool', 'wasting', 'web interface']",NHLBI,"AUSCULTECH DX, LLC",R42,2019,764643,0.010639336637405081
"Early understanding of multi-digit numbers Place value concepts and multi-digit numbers are the foundations of mathematics; however, many  children struggle at acquiring this knowledge. Poor understanding of the place value concepts has  been linked to difficulties in mathematics learning through the elementary and middle school  grades, and it is present not only for children with learning disabilities but also for a large  proportion of normally developing children. It is, thus, important to understand the developmental  mechanisms of multi-digit number learning and potential sources of early experiences that allow  some children to readily grasp the concepts while others continue to struggle. Recent research on place value concepts has suggested that children have partial knowledge of  multi-digit numbers at the preschool period, before receiving formal training from schools. These  precursors of multi-digit number knowledge can serve as important stepping-stones for children to  master the concept of place value once entering schools. However, there are at least two gaps in  our current understanding of the development  of place value concepts. First, how does early  understanding of multi-digit numbers relate to formal school training of the place value concepts?  Second, how do children come to acquire partial knowledge of multi-digit numbers at such a young  age in the first place? The goal of the proposed research aims at filling these gaps in the  literature with three specific aims. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that early knowledge of multi-digit  numbers is predictive of later school learning of the place value concepts. I propose to conduct a  3-year longitudinal study to measure children’s early understanding of multi-digit numbers at the  start and end of kindergarten, 1st  and 2nd grades. The study will test how early knowledge of  number names and written numerals, as well as other individual difference measurements (e.g., age,  gender, SES, number sense, home exposures to numbers),  relate to the learning of base-10  principles in grade school. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that acquiring early knowledge of  multi-digit numbers is a form of statistical learning, during which children extract latent  structures that govern the mapping between number words and written numerals through sparse  co-occurrence data. A training study is designed to give children casual experiences with  multi-digit numbers in engaging and child- friendly activities (e.g., picture-book reading, ipad  games). The same children in the statistical learning training will also be given formal school  training afterward, allowing us to assess and provide causal evidence for the hypothesis that early  knowledge prepares children for formal school training of the place value concepts. The knowledge  gained from this research will have implications for: a) determining the role of early knowledge of  multi-digit numbers in preparing children to learn about base-10 notation at schools; b) linking  statistical learning from sparse co-occurrence data about number words and multi-digit numbers to  early partial knowledge of place value; c) documenting how differences in early learning  environment (or input) may contribute to developmental inequalities in later school performances. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims at understanding the early development of multi-digit numbers, its learning mechanisms and its impact on formal school training of place value concepts. The period of development studied here, from 3 to 5 years of age, is a period during which sizable individual differences in multi-digit number knowledge starts to emerge, which may contribute to early developmental inequalities that limit the development of some children even after entering school. The proposed work is relevant to public health in that it will shed light on how differences in early learning environment lead to individual differences in early understanding of multi-digit numbers, potentially serving as the foundation for future early mathematical training programs.",Early understanding of multi-digit numbers,9567447,F32HD090827,"['5 year old', '6 year old', 'Age', 'Books', 'Child', 'Consequentialism', 'Correlation Studies', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Digit structure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inequality', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Names', 'Nursery Schools', 'Only Child', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preschool Child', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'early experience', 'educational atmosphere', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'first grade', 'formal learning', 'grasp', 'junior high school', 'kindergarten', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematics disability', 'second grade', 'socioeconomics', 'success']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F32,2019,59038,0.00024208241248843056
"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5  percent of school-­aged children in the US. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of children with FASD and their  families can access FASD-­informed interventions due to significant systems-­ and family-­level barriers.  Research suggests that self-­directed and peer-­to-­peer interventions are acceptable to families and can lead to  significant improvements in parenting, child behavior, and resource utilization. Advancements in technology  are facilitating more accessible and interactive methods for self-­directed education and support. The proposed  project will develop and evaluate the efficacy of a novel mobile health (mHealth) application (“app”) to directly  provide caregivers with evidence-­based content and peer-­moderated support they can easily access and use  to improve outcomes for their children and families. The app, currently called “FMF Connect,” will be derived  from the scientifically-­validated Families Moving Forward (FMF) Program and will build on existing frameworks  for the development of medical apps. This project will follow a systematic approach to the development and  evaluation of the FMF Connect mHealth intervention, including a small-­scale feasibility trial (n=30), and a  larger-­scale hybrid implementation-­effectiveness trial (n=120) with caregivers raising children (ages 3-­12) with  FASD. Implementation data will aid in identifying the patterns of app usage that relate to the greatest  improvements in child and caregiver outcomes. Study hypotheses are: 1) that caregivers will find the FMF  Connect intervention acceptable, with easy to access content and encouraging support from peer-­moderators;;  2) that greater usage of specific intervention components will relate to larger improvements in child and  caregiver outcomes;; 3) that caregivers who receive the FMF Connect intervention will have larger gains on  child and caregiver outcomes relative to a waitlist comparison group;; and 4) that an increase in  neurodevelopmental attributions for behavior will mediate intervention-­related improvements in parenting  efficacy and child behavior. Project findings will guide further app development both in terms of content and  technological advances to optimize intervention effects. Results of this study will further the overall strategic  aims of the Collaborative Initiative on FASD (CIFASD), which are to inform and develop effective interventions  for FASD. This project will also benefit from resources and collaborations within CIFASD to carry out the  proposed work, including recruitment of a diverse sample, diagnostic support, and outreach and dissemination.  This is one of the first studies to empirically test an mHealth intervention delivered by parents with peer-­

"Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use across different clinical centers; (2) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post- surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a multi-center study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 focus on relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology, developed at Texas Children's Hospital, which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor,9728036,R01HL142994,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Common Ventricle', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Ventricle', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infant', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Surgery', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Surgical complication', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'news', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'respiratory', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,573724,0.0532666504978352
"Technology and Parent-Child Interaction PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Radesky is a board-certified Developmental Behavioral Pediatrician whose prior research and clinical work has focused on the importance of early childhood experiences in shaping long-term developmental and behavioral outcomes, particularly in low-income children. Her research has examined how digital media – including television and mobile devices such as smartphones – interacts with the early-parent child relationship, both being shaped by, and shaping, parenting behaviors and child social-emotional development. This mentored career development award will allow her to learn additional methodologies for assessing parent- child interaction and mobile device usage by parents. She has identified a comprehensive, trans-disciplinary mentoring team at the University of Michigan Departments of Pediatrics, Health Behavior and Health Education, Psychiatry, Psychology, Communications, and Informatics, as well as the Center for Human Growth and Development, to provide methodological and content expertise, including: Julie Lumeng, MD; Alison Miller, PhD; Katherine Rosenblum, PhD; Scott W. Campbell, PhD; and Mark Newman, PhD. This team of mentors and advisors will help guide her towards the following Training and Career Goals: 1. Develop working knowledge of theoretical models of parent-child interaction 2. Develop skills in using mobile devices to collect usage data and ecologic momentary assessment of parent  emotional states 3. Develop skills in research methods to assess parent-child interaction, including:  a) Behavioral coding of parent-child interaction from videotape  b) Language Environment Analysis (LENA) audiorecording to measure parent-child verbal interaction 4. Learn statistical analytic techniques unique to assessing parent-child interaction 5. Develop familiarity with the field of information science/human-computer interaction to inform future studies. Healthy social-emotional development in young children relies on sensitive, responsive parent-child interactions, particularly in children growing up in adversity. Screen media use is a highly prevalent behavior that may be a modifiable barrier to responsive parent-child interactions. Despite rapid increases in the use of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) by families with young children, there is a paucity of research examining associations between mobile device use and parent-child interactions. This research plan focuses on testing a conceptual model that parent and child traits predict how parents use mobile devices during family activities, and that certain features of this device use (particularly their emotional response to it) predict changes in parent-child interaction. This model also examines temporal contingencies in parent-child interaction and mobile device use, in order to help clarify directionality. This conceptual model will be tested through 3 Specific Aims: Aim 1) Test the hypotheses that parent depressive symptoms, lower parenting self-efficacy, higher parenting stress, and child difficult temperament and lower child emotion regulation are associated with higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use. Aim 2) Test the hypotheses that higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use are associated with less parent-child verbal exchange, lower parental responsivity, more parent-child conflict, and lower parent ability to read child behavioral cues. Aim 3) Determine whether changes in parent-child interaction (changes in parent and child affect, verbal exchange, parent responsivity, parent-child conflict, or parent ability to read child behavioral cues) occur before or after parent mobile device use. These Specific Aims will be carried out in two complementary cohorts: A) 296 low-income mother-child dyads enrolled in an existing cohort study with previously collected videotapes of home mealtimes, during which mobile devices are commonly used; and B) 100 parent-child dyads from a range of socioeconomic status backgrounds who will be followed for 4 days of data collection with continuous mobile device-based passive sensing of the parent's mobile device use, coordinated with simultaneous audiorecording of parent-child interaction using Language Environment Analysis (LENA) technology. Future Implications: The results from this work will contribute to an evidence base about how families can use the explosion of new media in their households in the healthiest ways possible, both through the formation of clinical guidelines and future interventional approaches. PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Despite the rapidly increasing ownership and use of mobile technology by parents and evidence showing that older technologies such as television displace important parent-child interactions, remarkably little research has examined the effects of mobile device use on families. This proposal examines which parent-child dyads are at highest risk of disturbances in parent-child interaction from mobile devices, how parent mobile device use precedes or follows changes in parent-child interactions, and the behavioral mechanisms underlying these associations. We anticipate that our findings will be applied to clinical guidelines for mobile device use by families, interventions to help improve parent-child engagement in the highest risk families, and the development of technologies that might be better designed to not intrude upon family time.",Technology and Parent-Child Interaction,9702069,K23HD092626,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Attention', 'Audiotape', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Caregivers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communication', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Familiarity', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Health education', 'Hearing', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Sciences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Observational Study', 'Ownership', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Provider', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Self Efficacy', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'career', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'digital media', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'irritation', 'mobile computing', 'pediatric department', 'pediatrician', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'skills', 'social', 'technology development', 'theories', 'trait']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2019,167319,0.019575185449699484
"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%. Despite progress that has been made in recent years to understand the anatomical and functional attributes of OSAS in children, the precise mechanism leading to the disorder remains unknown in the majority of obese children, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to implement state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image analytics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomechanical modeling, to establish the biomechanical basis that leads to OSAS or protects from it, in naïve and treated children with obesity. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9699521,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', '3-Dimensional', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'ROC Curve', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tonsil', 'Treatment outcome', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiometabolism', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,743544,0.0559485679962602
"Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment. Abstract Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities, with prevalence estimates of 3-10/1000 individuals in the US and up to 80/1000 in endemic communities. The promise of an increasing number of interventions tailored to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE)-related neurobehavioral deficits is limited by diagnostic difficulties in clinical practice. Currently known biomarkers of exposure are neither sensitive nor specific for neurobehavioral deficits, in part because not all exposed children are affected. There is, therefore, a critical need for biomarkers of effect to identify affected children who would benefit from early, tailored therapeutic interventions. A growing body of literature has demonstrated alcohol-induced alterations in epigenetic programming as an important potential mechanism in FASD, suggesting that such alterations may serve as biomarkers of effect. Imprinted genes comprise a unique subset of epigenetically regulated genes that is sensitive to prenatal insults. There is considerable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected by FASD and those seen in experimental animal models of imprinted gene dysregulation, including learning, memory, and attachment. In a prenatally- recruited, prospective longitudinal cohort, we recently found that PAE was associated with alterations in placental level of expression of 11 of 93 expressed imprinted genes. Expression changes for five of these genes statistically mediated effects of alcohol on postnatal growth, identifying these alterations as biomarkers of fetal alcohol growth restriction. Given the remarkable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected in FASD and those affected by alteration of imprinted gene expression in animal models, alcohol-induced alterations in placental imprinted gene expression may also provide biomarkers for FASD neurocognitive deficits. Although most epigenetic marks are specific to tissue-type and timing of exposure, genomic imprinting maps and our pilot data indicate that markers of imprinted gene dysregulation identified in placental tissue may be detected in blood samples obtained at older ages. The aims of this study are: (1) To characterize the fetal alcohol-related imprintome signature in the placenta and in blood samples obtained at 6 yr; (2) To identify alterations in imprinted gene level of expression and ICR methylation that can serve as biomarkers of effect; (3) To validate findings in Aims 1 and 2 in blood samples from a 2nd, independent cohort. The data for this study will come from two prospective longitudinal cohorts recruited from the Cape Coloured community in Cape Town, South Africa, where the prevalence of FASD is among the highest in the world. Results from this study will make it possible to identify affected children who would benefit from early therapeutic interventions but would likely not be detected by current diagnostic tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite widespread public health advisories, alcohol use during pregnancy persists in the U.S. and worldwide, making fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental delay. The promise of an ever-increasing number of interventions tailored to FASD deficits is limited by difficulties in identifying fetal alcohol-related facial dysmorphology in infancy and early childhood, when interventions are most effective, and in children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, in which neurodevelopmental impairment occurs in the absence of dysmorphic features. This proposal seeks to identify alterations in imprinted gene expression that can be used as biomarkers of adverse effect to identify infants and children with FASD who would benefit from therapeutic interventions but would probably not be detected by current diagnostic tools.",Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment.,9913250,R01AA027916,"['Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Growth Disorders', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methylation', 'Microcephaly', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Nursery Schools', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Placenta', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'South Africa', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'early childhood', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gene function', 'imprint', 'infancy', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'whole genome']",NIAAA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,597565,-0.018708435988142993
"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate. In this application, we propose to develop and assess the validity of an in-home objective, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system, called FLASH that has the potential to revolutionize the measurement of screen use behaviors.",Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH,9693725,R01DK113269,"['10 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'Asses', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral outcome', 'college', 'computational platform', 'cost', 'diaries', 'field study', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity development', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'preservation', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'tv watching', 'validation studies']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,515083,-0.013192053188452357
"Images of Children and Adults for Health Research Abstract: This project's goal of expanding the extant archive for a major longitudinal study to include an innovative collection of images of children and adults is well-aligned with the initiative (PAR-16-149) to support the archiving of NICHD-funded data sets for secondary data analyses. The longitudinal study was funded through a U01 partnership with NICHD, and the images that will be added to its archive can take longitudinal and intergenerational health research in significantly new directions. As background, the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD) was a major investment of NICHD in a longitudinal study of children and parents. The observational, survey, medical, biological, and video data from the NICHD- sponsored data collection over 15 years are archived at the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), with data collection on the now-adult sample ongoing. A current R01 project by the PIs of this proposal has developed a systematic process for extracting and rating “short slice” images of children and parents from videos. This system has resulted in short slices of children at 11 time points, short slices of mothers at four time points, and ratings of the attractiveness of their faces and bodies at all these time points. The child ratings—along with a detailed codebook—are already being added to the SECCYD archive through the current R01 so that health scholars licensed with ICPSR can merge them with the SECCYD for analyses of child and adolescent development. The proposed R03 would allow a substantial and valuable expansion by also archiving the actual short slices of children, extracting short slices of mothers at the remaining time points, extracting the short slices of fathers at the five time points they were videotaped, and adding all of these short slices to the archive along with expanded codebooks. The PIs are partnering with ICPSR to open up their secure system for housing and organizing these images so that other researchers could use them for their own purposes and not have to travel to the ICSPR data enclave. Such an enterprise would exploit the original R01 project to realize substantial economies of scale in creating a resource for health research to inform a wide array of health and health-relevant literatures. Indeed, a substantial body of research has documented the valid and reliable ways that images of the face and body can be used. For example, scholars could access this expanded SECCYD archive to examine the development of health conditions (e.g., obesity), the corrosive effects of disadvantage on health (e.g., the physical toll of poverty), the link between social stigmas and health (e.g., colorism and depression), family health dynamics (e.g., disjunctures in health of parents and children), and other important questions concerning individual and population health. They can also go beyond human rating to exploit new machine scoring techniques that enable measurements beyond the human eye that provide insights into biological processes (e.g., hormone levels, sexual dimorphism). The codebooks will also provide a template for other scholars to expand their own NIH-funded data collections or to launch new ones. Project Narrative In response to a NICHD funding opportunity on archiving datasets, this project will significantly contribute to a number of fields of health research by archiving an expansive longitudinal set of images of the faces and bodies of children and their parents over a 15 year period. With a secure system to facilitate ease of access and use, such images can be human rated (e.g., perceived age, weight, skin color) and machine scored (e.g., biologically informative facial measurements) to measure continuity and change in physical development and health and to capture the physical toll of the environment on individual wellbeing. Extending a prior NICHD- funded project that rated 11 waves of videos from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development to longitudinally study children's appearance, this larger archive of images will provide a valuable resource for researchers aiming to conduct innovative research on health and health disparities.",Images of Children and Adults for Health Research,9745971,R03HD096203,"['Academic achievement', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Appearance', 'Archives', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Birds', 'Birth', 'Catalogs', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Corrosives', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline', 'Documentation', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Family health status', 'Fathers', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Guidelines', 'Half-Life', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health Status', 'Hormones', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Investments', 'Licensing', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nose', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Social Environment', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Videotape', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'base', 'data archive', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'image archival system', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'middle age', 'population health', 'recruit', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sexual dimorphism', 'skin color', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social implication', 'social stigma', 'transmission process']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2019,78706,0.041916196550788945
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9729825,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,173441,0.011175509872551063
"4/5 HEAL Consortium: Establishing Innovative Approaches  for the HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study Opioid use among pregnant women is increasing significantly, and consequently, a more than 5-fold increase in the incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) has been reported since 2000. Preliminary studies show that prenatal opioid exposure is associated with increased risk of impaired neurodevelopment across cognitive, motor and behavioral domains. Therefore, studies to rigorously characterize the impacts of prenatal opioid exposure on early brain development are critically needed. In our application, five institutions (Duke University, Arkansas Children’s Research Institute, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) with complementary expertise, have formed a consortium to develop strategies to prepare for the Phase II HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study, a planned large scale multi-site research study to examine the long-term impact of prenatal drug exposure on long term childhood outcomes. Leveraging the unique skills of our multidisciplinary team, we will develop essential instruments and strategies (recruitment/retention protocols, assessment batteries, and novel tools) for the Phase II study (Aim 1). We will conduct pilot studies (fetal and postnatal imaging, advanced imaging harmonization and quality control, assessment administration, biosampling) to evaluate instruments for the Phase II study (Aim 2). Finally, we will analyze available data (Aim 3), including imaging, behavioral, cognitive and maternal data from studies focusing on early brain development, to provide critical information to guide the Phase II study design. Upon completion of the proposed aims, our consortium will be in an ideal position to conduct the future Phase II study.

"Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders Project Summary: Early life psychosocial adversity and stress are well-established as the most powerful environmental risk factors for poor neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes in children. Impairments in developing emotion regulation and cognitive control and associated alterations in brain development have been shown to mediate the effects of adversity on risk for the development of psychopathology. Early psychosocial adversity impacts the epigenetic and inflammation-mediated processes that contribute to these negative outcomes, a process known as “biological embedding of stress.” While this risk trajectory has been clearly linked to increased rates of psychopathology, the mechanisms of this process, its targetable mediators and how early in development they operate are yet to be determined. Here we focus on the effects of early life adversity on brain, emotion regulation and cognitive control outcomes relevant to risk for mental disorders, beginning antenatally and extending to age 3. We will examine the role of pre- and postnatal adversity/stress, the maternal and child perinatal gut microbiome and early caregiver support on these key neurodevelopmental outcomes utilizing state-of-the-art neuroimaging. Our unifying hypothesis is that these factors modulate systemic inflammatory responses, induce neuronal effects through this and other processes that adversely impact brain development in limbic and cortical regions, and mediate the effects of early adversity on child emotion regulation, cognitive control and mental health outcomes. These factors will be studied in a unique, prospectively ascertained cohort of 370 mothers and their offspring at high psychosocial risk being recruited as part of an already funded March of Dimes project at Washington University. The cohort will include both term- and prematurely-born infants and toddlers given the increased risk of psychosocial adversity and aberrant gut microbiome in preterm children. The offspring will be intensively prospectively studied from the 1st trimester to age 3, providing a unique dataset in which to examine the interrelationships among pre- and postnatal adversity, biomarkers of inflammation, the gut microbiome and developmental and mental health outcomes. The perinatal and early childhood periods are critical times to study these exposures as adverse neurodevelopment associated with adversity begins in utero through fetal programming. Likewise, the perinatal period is a critical developmental window for microbial influences, when gut microbial colonization has its most enduring effects. The proposed study merges established research groups in these areas in a center with advanced infant and childhood neuroimaging and extensive microbiome expertise, and offers an unprecedented opportunity to understand the mechanisms of the biological embedding of adversity on brain, cognitive and emotional trajectories in a high-risk cohort. We will also apply innovative computational methods, using Deep Learning, to extend understanding of these data. Findings will provide critical and novel insights to inform early preventive interventions relevant to emotional, cognitive and mental health outcomes for children at greatest risk. Project Narrative This study will investigate the mechanisms by which psychosocial adversity experienced in utero and early in life impact the child’s brain, cognitive and emotional development, testing the hypothesis that stress and adversity during pregnancy adversely affect early brain development through inflammatory mechanisms. Another important focus of this project is to examine how the maternal perinatal microbiome and infant’s gut microbiome during early childhood impact brain development, either through the infant’s inflammatory response or other effects. A third focus is to explore the effects of caregiver support on this risk trajectory, testing the idea that high caregiver support reduces the negative influences of early adversity, altered immune biomarkers and disruptions in the gut microbiome.","Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders",9701281,R01MH113883,"['3 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caregiver support', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Funding', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informal Social Control', 'Instruction', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mothers', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Poverty', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'antenatal', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep learning', 'early childhood', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'fetal programming', 'gray matter', 'gut colonization', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'infant gut microbiome', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal microbiome', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiome', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal period', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,2374629,0.030888407402195527
"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual projects.",Administrative Core of the CIFASD,9698228,U24AA014811,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data management', 'diagnostic screening', 'drinking', 'eHealth', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'forging', 'health care service', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical research', 'program dissemination', 'recruit', 'repository', 'resilience', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web site']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2019,435603,-0.05978797430339266
"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates.

"A bench to population epidemiologic approach to investigating the effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child gut inflammation, growth, and development PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Lin is a research scientist at the University of California, Berkeley in Professor John (Jack) Colford's group. She completed her PhD in Microbiology and Immunology at Stanford University in 2012. Since 2010, she has worked as the coordinating microbiologist for the WASH Benefits study, a large-scale, multi- country cluster randomized trial evaluating the impact of water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutritional interventions on child health, with a focus on gut inflammation. This research and training plan builds on her strong interdisciplinary background at the nexus of microbiology, immunology, and global health. Gaining experience in epidemiology and biostatistics will facilitate her transition to a `bench to population' independent investigator at UC Berkeley and will ultimately enable her to achieve her long-term career goal to become a global health leader in the evaluation of antenatal and early life interventions to improve child health. Environment: UC Berkeley has a long history of conducting innovative and groundbreaking research advancing epidemiological and biostatistical theory and application in international health. To achieve her career goal, Dr. Lin seeks training in (1) epidemiology, with a focus on causal inference methods (in particular, marginal structural models for direct and indirect effects and targeted maximum likelihood estimation) (2) biostatistics and (3) child stress and development. To achieve these goals, Dr. Lin has assembled a unique interdisciplinary training and mentoring team based at UC Berkeley. Jack Colford (primary mentor) will guide her training in epidemiological theory and application. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor) will guide her training in biostatistics and causal inference methods including models for direct and indirect effects and targeted maximum likelihood estimation. Lia Fernald (co-mentor) will guide her training in child development and stress. Research Project: Early life linear growth faltering is associated with impaired development, but its underlying pathogenesis is poorly understood. Subclinical intestinal inflammation and damage affects children living in low-income countries and is increasingly recognized as a potential main contributor to the vicious cycle of early life malnutrition and oral vaccine failure. Little is known about the pregnancy risk factors associated with gut inflammation and the impact of these antenatal factors on linear growth and neurodevelopment. In Aim 1, Dr. Lin will determine the association between maternal stress and inflammation during pregnancy and subsequent measures of child gut inflammation and permeability. In Aim 2, she will evaluate the relationship between antenatal stress and inflammation and future child linear growth and development. She proposes to use modern causal inference methods to elucidate the potential pathways from antenatal stress and inflammation to child gut inflammation, linear growth faltering, and poor development. Ultimately, this mentored research will prepare Dr. Lin for a successful R01-level application to investigate potential downstream effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child stress, inflammation, and susceptibility to infections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Widely pervasive subclinical inflammation and damage of the small intestine is observed in children living in low-income countries and is increasingly recognized as a potential main contributor to the vicious cycle of early life malnutrition and oral vaccine failure. Little is known about the pregnancy risk factors associated with gut inflammation and permeability and the impact of these antenatal factors on linear growth and neurodevelopment in infants from low-income countries. Understanding these critical pathways will be an important contribution to public health because it will enable the identification of key biological markers to identify prospectively at-risk children, to evaluate the efficacy of interventions, and to suggest potential intervention targets to improve child linear growth and development trajectories; we propose to use modern causal inference methods to elucidate these critical pathways in children living in rural Bangladesh.","A bench to population epidemiologic approach to investigating the effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child gut inflammation, growth, and development",9662744,K01AI136885,"['5 year old', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'C-reactive protein', 'California', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Country', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'F2-Isoprostanes', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hygiene', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Lactulose', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Mannitol', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neopterin', 'Nutritional', 'Observational Study', 'Orosomucoid', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peroxidases', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Small Intestines', 'Stress', 'Structural Models', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Villous Atrophy', 'Water', 'Work', 'absorption', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin', 'antenatal', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'career', 'cytokine', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'fetal programming', 'global health', 'improved', 'innovation', 'low income country', 'maternal stress', 'neurodevelopment', 'oral vaccine', 'prevent', 'professor', 'prospective', 'repository', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'therapy development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2019,138842,0.03939911944534522
"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,9765987,R01ES030302,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Arsenic', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cadmium', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Diseases', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Temperament', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxin', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'behavioral disinhibition', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early pregnancy', 'epigenetic marker', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'loss of function', 'metal poisoning', 'nanosized', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'overexpression', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal risk factor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'tool', 'toxic metal', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,646285,0.05603029159448191
"Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria Project Summary: FASD is a serious public health crisis with 80,000 to 120,000 U.S. pregnancies per year at high risk. FASD diagnostic clinics are very sparse, difficult to sustain because of diagnostic complexity, unable to meet demand, and plagued by disagreement about diagnostic criteria. A recent comparison of five FASD diagnostic systems acknowledged that the lack of objective biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) contributes to disagreement in the field. The goal of the proposed work is to develop and refine neuroimaging methods capable of identifying subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE. A critical component of this project will be to apply these refined neuroimaging “biomarkers” to examine the validity and performance of the most commonly-used FASD diagnostic criteria (alcohol exposure, dysmorphology, growth, and cognition). The proposed project will push the development of imaging methods and will also include an examination of the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic factors. The aims are: 1) perform a comprehensive characterization of the FASD “connectome” using state-of- the-art Human Connectome Project (HCP) methods in children with PAE, 2) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FASD diagnostic criteria to provide objective evaluation of FASD criteria (which remain in flux), 3) characterize relationships between connectomics and cognitive functioning, & 4) examine the developmental course of functional connectivity, white matter connectivity, cortical gyrification, and intra-cortical myelin. Participants will undergo longitudinal re-assessment at 15-months to match the new HCP-development paradigm (HCP-D) to allow for comparison to a large normative dataset being collected in Minnesota as part of the HCP-D project. We will capitalize on the developments spawned from the $40 million HCP and will benefit from evaluating the brains of children with PAE against the backdrop of a very large HCP normative dataset (n=1300). The proposed study will examine 45 participants with PAE and 45 matched controls, ages 8-16, all of whom will be evaluated by the CIFASD dysmorphology project. Participants will undergo MRI scans at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at baseline and again 15 months later. The imaging protocol, which contains very high resolution structural, diffusion- weighted, and fMRI scans will evaluate cortical gyrification, intra-cortical myelin, white matter connectivity, and functional connectivity. Data from the HCP-D project will be used as secondary “normative” comparison dataset. We expect to find a number of subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE that have not previously been observed and we will characterize individuals with these metrics. Individual identification of neurodevelopmental anomalies will then allow us to probe the screening properties of commonly used FASD diagnostic criteria and to test the performance of Dr. Mattson's Decision Tree model for rapidly identifying children with developmental effects of PAE. The study will have direct implications for FASD clinical practice and public policies as it will provide objective data about the relative advantages and disadvantages of individual diagnostic elements and it will allow for comparisons of competing FASD diagnostic systems. The proposed project aims to use the most advanced MRI brain imaging techniques available to address a highly practical problem faced by clinicians and public health officials: the lack of consensus about diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and the challenges of identifying individuals who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but do not have the physical characteristics upon which a diagnosis can be made. The proposed study will identify subtle brain anomalies in children with PAE with a level of sensitivity not previously attainable. The study will push forward our understanding of how PAE negatively affects the efficiency of the brain's networks. In addition, the study will use these brain imaging results to further refine the diagnostic criteria such that more children will be able to be properly identified as having a neurodevelopmental disorder as a result of PAE.",Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria,9698862,U01AA026102,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dysmorphology', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Myelin', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'connectome', 'diffusion weighted', 'executive function', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'performance tests', 'prisma', 'processing speed', 'screening', 'white matter']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2019,347168,-0.005079775349654817
"Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies Project Summary Traditionally, environmental epidemiologic studies have focused on assessing risks related to a single pollutant at a time. This, however, does not reflect reality, since we are constantly exposed to multiple pollutants at once. It is very important, therefore, to be able to assess exposure to pollutant mixtures when conducting environmental epidemiologic methods. Doing so, however, is especially challenging, mainly due to the high dimension of the multi-pollutant exposure matrix (if the exposure of interest includes more than e.g. 5 or 10 chemicals) and because these pollutants are usually very highly correlated with each other. Although some methods are available to address these issues, they usually require strong assumptions and have severe limitations. With this study we propose to bypass most of these limitations by adapting and extending a novel and robust method to assess exposure to multiple pollutants, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). We will assess the performance of PCP synthetic datasets representing multiple potential scenarios and study designs, and compare our results to those obtained by existing methods. Subsequently, we will apply PCP to three important Public Health issues, i.e. to evaluate the associations between (i) in utero exposure to a mixture of PCBs and neurodevelopment, (ii) exposure to a metals mixture and cardiovascular health, and (iii) exposure to an air pollution mixture and emergency cardiovascular admissions. Finally, we will develop and share software so other researchers can freely use this novel, robust and flexible tool across a plethora of study designs and research questions. Our proposed work will be significant as it will provide epidemiologists with a novel and robust tool to assess exposure to environmental pollutant mixtures. Project Narrative We are constantly exposed to a mixture of environmental pollutants at once, but current epidemiologic methods either assess each pollutant separately, not capturing reality, or have severe limitations. With this study we propose to adapt a wildly popular method used in computer vision applications, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), and develop flexible extensions for many epidemiologic settings. We propose to assess the performance of this method, compare with existing methods and employ in real-life applications, as well as develop and share software so other research can also use this novel, robust and flexible tool.",Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies,9617736,R01ES028805,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Educational workshop', 'Emergency Situation', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Poison', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Work', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'policy implication', 'pollutant', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,600285,0.050243561265055345
"Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children Project Summary Access to diagnosis of autism and to invaluable early interventional therapy is severely hampered by the imbalance between the number of children needing care and the inadequate number of clinical practitioners who can deliver that care. This numerical imbalance is unlikely to change in the near future, and therefore there is an urgent need and an exciting opportunity to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers of children at risk for or with a diagnosis of autism, and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Using machine learning and large-scale data mining, we have built a mobile system to quantify and track the severity of autism that takes only minutes of a caregiver’s time and that has promise for repeat use at home due to its speed, accuracy and mobility. We have concomitantly developed a machine-learning system for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glass and delivers real time social cues to individuals with autism in that child’s natural environment. Our goal in this research program is to work with our clinical colleagues at Stanford’s Autism Center to test and refine these complementary machine-learning systems for accuracy and optimal use by families and their child with autism from their natural environments. We will then combine the two systems in a multi-month longitudinal trial designed to harness our mobilized machine learning tool to quantitatively measure the efficacy of our Autism Glasses as a therapeutic assistant that functions in real time and within the child’s natural environment. Our proposed experiments with at least 40 subjects at risk for developmental delay promise to demonstrate how to leverage digital health technologies to improve, mobilize and quicken the detection and treatment of autism. The work also will result in a new and unique dataset that validates the ability to bring the social learning process outside of the clinic and into the real world, leading to a faster, more fluid way for children with autism to gain social skills. We also expect our work to show how measurable indicators of behavioral improvement during therapy will facilitate the process of tracking progress on an increasingly more granular scale, and hopefully set the stage for more effective, precise and personalized treatment. Project Narrative There is a growing and striking imbalance between the number of clinical care providers and the number of children at risk for or managing an autism diagnosis, creating an urgent need to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Our research proposal is focused on building two complementary machine learning tools – one for rapid, mobile measurement of the autism phenotype and one for at-home social learning on Google Glasses – that we believe will open the diagnostic bottleneck and provide a valuable form of behavioral therapy that can be used at home and outside of the clinical setting.",Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children,9524706,R21HD091500,"['Address', 'Age', 'Android', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Therapeutics Program', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operating System', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Self-Direction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavior measurement', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'handheld equipment', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intervention program', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'prototype', 'social', 'social learning', 'social skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'trial design', 'wearable device']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,235500,-0.022493601810891883
"Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings Abstract Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in low-income countries. In high-income countries, pediatric diarrhea remains a major utilization of healthcare resources. Treatment of diarrhea is mostly empiric, with antibiotic use mostly based on clinical suspicion for bacterial causes. However, the majority of cases of diarrhea do not benefit from antibiotic use, and inappropriate use leads to toxicity and resistance. Furthermore, despite the increasing availability of rapid molecular testing, there is little data to base a decision of whom or when to test. Our overarching goal is to develop and validate clinical decision tools for management of diarrheal illnesses in children of both high and low resource settings. We will utilize prospectively-collected data from two recently-completed multicenter cohort studies of pediatric diarrhea. These studies feature extensive etiologic testing, well-characterized clinical elements, and longitudinal outcome data. We have assembled a team with expertise in pediatric diarrhea, clinical prediction rules, and machine learning methods. In Aim 1, we will use domestic data to develop and validate: a) a score for bacterial etiology, and b) a score for which patients are likely to benefit from further testing. We will derive the scores using data from IMPACT, an NIH-sponsored study of 1200 children from 5 US Emergency Departments, and validate using electronic health records from the Utah Intermountain Health System. In Aim 2, we will use international data to develop and validate: a) a diagnostic score for bacterial etiology, and b) a prognostic score for risk stratification of children who go on to poor outcomes. We will derive the scores using data from GEMS, a study of over 9400 children across 7 low-resource countries, and validate using VIDA study of children in 3 African countries. Completion of the Aims will result in the availability of a number of clinical tools that healthcare workers worldwide can use for evidence-based care of children with diarrhea. Project Narrative Diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The management of childhood diarrhea often depend on what type of pathogen is responsible, but in many cases testing is not affordable or feasible.

"Genotype-Phenotype Associations in Reading Disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Dyslexia and other language-based reading disorders (RD) account for nearly 85% of children receiving special education services in the U.S. RD affect between 5% and 17% of school-age children with boys at higher risk than girls. Children with RD are at high risk for academic failure and future underemployment. The current diagnosis of RD relies on behavioral symptoms. This means that RD cannot be identified until after the child has begun to learn to read. By this time, a potentially opportune window for intervention has been missed. Early identification and prevention is possible by using genetic markers because RD have a high heritability rate. The existing genetic studies about RD are limited in the sense that the gene-RD association was evaluated on a one-gene-at-a-time basis. This approach is not efficient because hundreds of thousands of genes need to be evaluated; nor is it effective because it runs a high risk of miss-detecting important genes due to overly-strict multiple test corrections applied to too many genes. Also, the existing one-gene-at-a-time approach only examines the marginal association of each gene with RD, without accounting for the joint effect of multiple genes and their interaction in relation to RD. For a complex phenotype like RD, a multi-gene- interactive mechanism is more plausible and has been supported by recent studies. Despite this, little research has been done to discover the genes simultaneously and characterize their interactions. This is partially because this field has not been able to take advantage of modern machine learning developments that provide effective and efficient approaches for genetic big data modeling and analysis. Another limitation of the existing studies is that they have been focused on single behavioral deficits and did not account for demographic difference. The short-term goals for this proposed project are to identify the gene sets associated with RD, link the gene sets to enriched functional biological pathways, characterize the gene-RD associations across the behavioral deficits in multiple reading abilities and accounting for demographic differences, and validate the findings using existing population-based datasets. These goals will be achieved using a combination of advanced machine learning algorithms and pathway analyses that are applied to existing population-based RD data sources. There are two specific aims: Aim 1 focuses on identification of significant genes and their interactions in relation to RD using sparse machine learning models and pathway analysis; Aim 2 focuses on validation for the models and findings in Aim 1 using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) dataset and another independent dataset. The long-term goal of this research is to contribute to the development of personalized early identification methods and early intervention for children at risk of RD. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Children with reading disorders account for up to 17 percent of the school-age population, and are at greater risk for underachievement in school, underemployment, and related mental health problems.

"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes.

"A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes.

"Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Project Summary: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Environmental exposure mixtures, especially when coupled with social stressors, have the potential to compromise developmental outcomes in children, but have been understudied. We will use a unique longitudinal dataset that tracks children from birth through early elementary school, in combination with new tools from modern data science, to disentangle the complex effects of these mixtures on educational outcomes.",Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures,9440248,R01ES028819,"['Address', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Architecture', 'Bayesian Method', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Factors', 'Birth', 'Birth Records', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Censuses', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Cox Models', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Gaussian model', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mothers', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nitrogen Dioxide', 'North Carolina', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Ozone', 'Particle Size', 'Particulate Matter', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pollution', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Shapes', 'Siblings', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Sulfur Dioxide', 'System', 'Taxes', 'Time', 'Unemployment', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deprivation', 'early childhood', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health care availability', 'indexing', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'pollutant', 'programs', 'rural environment', 'simulation', 'social', 'social stress', 'stressor', 'tool', 'web site']",NIEHS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,506174,0.039032875406901174
"Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development ABSTRACT This proposal will develop innovative technology for data-driven, multimodal characterization of nonverbal communication (NVC) in typical and atypical development. Prior research has provided qualitative descriptions of the development of children's use of gaze and gesture to regulate social interactions, but there are no objective, automated tools for measuring NVC behaviors, nor computational models to explain their coordination and timing in social interactions. This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children in the US. This project is focused on developing automated tools to characterize behaviors considered to be core, early emerging markers of autism, and that represent common treatment targets in this group. This has clear implications for identifying those at risk for autism and for ongoing clinical care.",Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development,9596160,R01MH114999,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Client', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Posture', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical care', 'common treatment', 'communication behavior', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gaze', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovative technologies', 'joint attention', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social communication', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,405254,-0.052343983852526456
"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health.

"The Home Evaluation, Assessment, Rating and Training of Gait (HEART-Gait) System for Monitoring Toe-Walking Severity in Children with Cerebral Palsy 1 Project Summary  2 Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a group of disorders attributed to non-progressive alterations occurring in the brain dur-  3 ing fetal and newborn development. These alterations affect movement, development and posture, causing  4 significant lifetime functional limitations. CP is the most common motor disorder in children, affecting 500,000  5 individuals in the US alone. Children with CP are commonly affected by gait impairments. One of the most  6 common impairments is equinus gait, or “toe-walking”, which is characterized by predominantly plantarflexed  7 feet during the whole gait cycle. Different interventions are available to treat equinus gait in children with CP  8 and include physical therapy, orthoses, botulinum toxin injections and surgery. To determine which intervention  9 is most appropriate to restore mobility for a given patient, periodic gait evaluations are performed in the clinic. 10 This Phase I SBIR proposal will develop a wearable system (Home Evaluation, Assessment, Rating and Train- 11 ing of Gait, HEART-Gait system) that continuously monitors and analyses simple gait parameters in children 12 with CP outside the clinical laboratory and during normal daily activities, which will provide clinically useful out- 13 comes data not currently available and critical diagnostic data for determining intervention timing. With access 14 to continuous data, the medical team is better informed and can effectively plan treatment, thus improving the 15 quality of care and the lives of children with CP and their families. Specific Aims are 16 Aim 1. Develop working prototype of HEART-Gait: Milestones are: 17 MS1: Veristride will optimize sensor selection and placement; construct prototype data acquisition hardware, 18 firmware and software. Months 1-2. 19 Aim 2. Iteratively design HEART-Gait system: Milestones are: 20 MS2: Veristride and the Spaulding team will work closely to modify the prototype system to make it suitable for 21 monitoring toe-walking in children with CP. Months 2-5. 22 MS3: The Spaulding team will interview 10 clinicians (unaffiliated with the project) and 10 families (guardians 23 and children) to gather their feedback about the HEART-Gait system. Months 2-5. 24 Aim 3. Evaluate the feasibility of HEART-Gait: Milestones are: 25 MS4: The Spaulding team will recruit 20 children (5-12 years) with CP and toe-walking pattern. Data will be 26 collected simultaneously from HEART-Gait and camera-based motion capture. Months 5-10. 27 MS5. The Spaulding team will derive a clinical index of the severity of toe-walking based on ankle biomechan- 28 ics data collected using the camera-based motion capture system. Months 6-11. 29 MS6. Veristride will collaborate with Spaulding team to develop machine-learning algorithms to estimate toe- 30 walking severity and characterize accuracy. Months 7-12. 31 Narrative Equinus gait, or “toe-walking”, is commonly observed in children with cerebral palsy (CP), and can be treated by a variety of treatments. This SBIR proposal will develop a wearable system that continuously monitors and analyses simple gait parameters in children with CP outside the clinical laboratory and during normal daily activities, which will provide clinically useful outcomes data not currently available and critical diagnostic data for determining intervention timing.

"Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use across different clinical centers; (2) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post- surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a multi-center study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 focus on relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology, developed at Texas Children's Hospital, which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor,9577420,R01HL142994,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Common Ventricle', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Ventricle', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infant', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Surgery', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Surgical complication', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'mortality', 'news', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'respiratory', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,644011,0.0532666504978352
"Spatiotemporal Risk Assessment Modeling of Chemical Mixtures Project Summary: Comprehensive exposure assessments that account for mixtures of environmental chemical pollutants are vital to understand true relationships between human exposures and disease outcomes. Moreover, human or daily mobility of people is often misrepresented by exposure models resulting in exposure misclassification. This proposal aims to determine how air pollution chemical mixtures and human mobility impact environmental and human health risk assessments, which aligns with the NIEHS core mission “to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives.” The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling. The primary mentor, Dr. Kim Anderson, a professor at Oregon State University is an expert in passive exposure assessment methods and analytical quantification of chemical mixtures in environmental media, which provides an excellent environment to transition the candidate from a background in single-pollutant exposure assessment to multi-pollutant mixture exposure and risk assessment. Along with new teaching opportunities, the candidate will receive training from Dr. Anderson in research methods such as primary data collection, biochemical monitoring for epidemiological studies, and toxicology approaches in risk assessment. Collaborators Drs. Katrina Waters and Justin Teeguarden, senior scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, will provide career development advising and research training in areas such as data integration for epidemiology and toxicology studies and hands-on experience with large-scale computational resources. This proposal’s aims will address the following central hypotheses: (1) Accounting for chemical mixtures in exposure will produce synergistic health effects not observed by chemicals individually, and (2) Personal sampling and model-based exposure assessment accounting for human mobility will produce varying risk estimates depending on the pollutant and individuals’ mobility. During the K99 phase, aim 1 will collect multi-chemical air quality data for a daily time resolved stationary monitoring campaign resulting in a space and time resolved multi-pollutant (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds) air quality dataset. Aim 2 will develop spatiotemporal exposure models for gas-phase mixtures using land use regression, geostatistical, and machine learning models. In the R00 phase, aim 3 will perform a risk assessment for chemical mixtures and acute lung health effects accounting for human mobility using a case-crossover design and comparing three exposure assessment methods: traditional spatiotemporal models, spatiotemporal models accounting for human mobility, and personal exposure monitors. Together, this proposal addresses the major limitations in environmental exposure assessment, pollutant mixtures and human mobility, and is within the mixtures and air pollution focus areas of environmental exposure research at NIEHS.

"Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease Project Summary Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 2.4 billion episodes of illness and 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in adults, adolescents, and children over five years. As the severity of diarrheal diseases can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While patients with severe dehydration require hospital admission and immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, those with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated in outpatient settings with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution. Yet, while several tools have been validated for use in children under five years of age, no clinical diagnostic tool has ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Differences in both adult physiology and diarrhea etiology may compromise the accuracy of clinical diagnostic models developed for use in young children. The proposed research will derive the very first age-specific clinical diagnostic models created for the assessment of dehydration status in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea, incorporate those models into a new mobile health (mHealth) tool, and validate the performance of this tool in a new population of patients with acute diarrhea. To accomplish this task, we will enroll a prospective cohort of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea presenting to the rehydration unit of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Dhaka, Bangladesh and collect data on presenting clinical signs and symptoms shown to correlate with dehydration severity in prior studies. We will then employ machine learning techniques to derive age-specific clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea. We will conduct formative research among clinicians working at icddr,b to develop an innovative mobile phone based platform which will incorporate these new age-specific diagnostic models for rapid use by frontline health workers. Finally, we will validate both the accuracy and reliability of the newly developed mHealth tool in a new population of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Once developed and properly validated, this novel mHealth tool has the potential to help physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers more accurately diagnose dehydration severity and better determine the optimal management strategy for patients with acute diarrhea. Improved diagnostic approaches may in turn be shown to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration. Project Narrative Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases remains a leading cause of death in both children and adults worldwide, yet no clinical tools have ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. The proposed research will both develop and validate an innovative new mobile phone based platform for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents, and older children with acute diarrhea. This new mobile health tool will help physicians, nurses, and other providers worldwide to determine the best management strategies for patients with acute diarrhea, potentially improving and rationalizing care for the hundreds of millions of patients each year presenting to healthcare facilities around the world with acute diarrhea.",Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease,9593233,R01DK116163,"['5 year old', 'Acute Diarrhea', 'Admission activity', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bangladesh', 'Beds', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'IV Fluid', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'International Unit', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort', 'Provider', 'Rehydration Solutions', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'international center', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2018,544336,0.011358681559477325
"Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health Project Summary  Decades of research suggest that neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage increases children's health risk. This proposed project seeks to address two major weaknesses in conventional neighborhood effects research and interventions: a) the assumption that residential neighborhoods function independently of each other - ignoring that risk factors in areas where people work, learn, and play away from home may interact with residential factors; and b) as importantly, insufficient understanding of neighborhood effects mechanisms and heterogeneity in effects. To systematically address these critical barriers in the field, I propose a research and training program that will enable me to learn, use, and adapt recent advancements in Big Data analytics. I plan to model hidden interdependencies among individuals and neighborhoods and operationalize mechanisms of neighborhood effects by drawing on multiple large datasets (demographic, geospatial, networks, population flows), with several hundred million observations across multiple states, cities, and years, and match them to locally and nationally representative restricted survey data. The massive volume, great variety, and unique complexity of such data, such as relational data on inter-neighborhood dependencies and interactions, pose a challenge to the standard capabilities of hardware, algorithms, and analytical methods and models of social and population science. The proposed training program in Big Data analytics and machine learning will enable me to overcome computational and conceptual challenges and uniquely position me to: a) examine the ecological inter-neighborhood networks (econetworks) to which population groups are differentially exposed to across space and time; and b) test new contextual mechanisms underlying children's exposures to health risks. Specifically, I propose to: a) develop computational models of dynamic large scale econetworks to assess population differences in exposures to health risk factors, as they commute daily between home and workplaces; b) examine heterogeneity in econetwork effects on child health using a hybrid design that links Big Data to local and national surveys; and c) model child health risk mechanisms and causal effects using natural experiments on Big Data. The proposed training program will enable me to learn and adapt Big Data analytics, draw on its strengths, but also address some of its key limitations. With the support of a unique team of distinguished mentors and advisors, established experts in Big Data analytics, spatial demography, network analysis, child development and health risk, neighborhood change, and population heterogeneity, I will embark on a training program that will uniquely enable me to address these research goals and position me to become an independent scholar and a leader in the field. Project Narrative This project contributes to advancing public health scholarship by leveraging and adapting Big Data analytical tools to overcome critical barriers in the field related to conventional assumptions about effects of neighborhood risk exposures on child health. It addresses the need to understand and model inter- neighborhood interdependencies and underlying multidimensional social capital mechanisms in order to better understand population heterogeneity in neighborhood effects on child health across space and time. The project also advances public health through an integration of rigorous social and data science methodology to create new measures and test causal hypotheses that advance our understanding of social capital forces that foster resilience to adversity and improve child health behavior and outcomes.",Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health,9569278,K01HD093863,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Businesses', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Child Rearing', 'Cities', 'Collaborations', 'Commuting', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Demography', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Drug usage', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health behavior outcomes', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Surveys', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'Social Work', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress and Coping', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'boys', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'low socioeconomic status', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'population health', 'programs', 'resilience', 'social capital', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'theories', 'violence exposure']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,K01,2018,139005,0.024586087000802476
"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.",The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders,9503067,R01MH104030,"['Advertisements', 'Age', 'Anniversary', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family history of', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuropsychology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'brain abnormalities', 'caudate nucleus', 'comparison group', 'critical period', 'dexterity', 'follow-up', 'habit learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical attention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomenological models', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'secondary analysis', 'vector']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,636092,0.043536355798403176
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9538116,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,679633,0.008551337885397612
"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining sophisitcated data-analysis methods that use experiential and phenotypic heterogeneity together with longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral assessments in school-age children. This approach will increase precision when linking ECAs and child outcomes associated with the Research Domain Criteria constructs of Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS). The overarching goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the heterogeneous impact of ECAs on neurodevelopmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. This project's premise is that children exposed to ECAs have highly heterogeneous developmental histories as well as heterogeneous outcomes; therefore, prediction of ECA outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-driven approaches will 1) more precisely define NVS/CCS outcomes for school-aged children with ECAs, and 2) provide a more robust explanatory model for links between ECAs and NVS/CCS trajectories. Aim 1A subtypes children with a history of ECAs based on 2.5-year developmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. 300 6-8 year old children (250 sampled from previous institutional and foster care; 50 community comparisons) will provide neuroimaging, behavioral, and self/caregiver reports every 15 months for 2.5 years. Biclustering methods will be applied to the baseline and follow-up data to identify homogeneous NVS/CCS final outcome clusters of children. Aim 1B develops an explanatory model to predict developmental trajectory subtypes for children with ECAs, from early life profiles and brain/behavior phenotypes at the time of enrollment. Machine learning methods applied to early life profiles, baseline NVS/CCS profiles, and sex, will predict developmental trajectory subtypes. Aim 2 identifies adverse and protective life events during the 2.5-year assessment period that are predictive of 2.5-year follow-up outcomes for children with ECAs. The inclusion of child-sex and current life- events will identify potential divergence in pathways across middle childhood. This prospective design of children exposed to various ECAs is designed to develop predictive models for ECA trajectory subtypes and outcomes, which can inform our understanding of risk and protective factors in accord with the goals of precision medicine.   Project Narrative Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology, and it is estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining longitudinal multimodal brain imaging and high- dimensional behavioral assessments in school-age children together with sophisticated data analytic techniques to increase precision when linking heterogeneous ECAs and child outcome with the goal of predicting mental health outcomes and identifying children who would benefit most from specific early interventions.  ",Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities,9552270,R01MH091864,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Orphanages', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'caregiving', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'foster care', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'middle childhood', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prepuberty', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'violence exposure']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2018,753980,0.0635301968414171
"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution health effects on asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome parameters in especially vulnerable minority children populations.",Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework,9540891,K99ES027511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'African American', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'American', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'European', 'Exposure to', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Future', 'GALA', 'Genetic', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Latino', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Puerto Rican', 'Randomized', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'adverse outcome', 'analog', 'base', 'career', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic difference', 'experience', 'exposure pathway', 'health disparity', 'interest', 'minority children', 'pollutant', 'public health intervention', 'pulmonary function', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'social disparities', 'tool']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K99,2018,88012,0.005263458999385762
"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes. The goal is to identify imaging measures which identify preterm infants at risk for particular deficits, thereby allowing institution of timely therapies specific to each chid's needs and enabling larger research trials evaluating interventions designed to improve developmental outcomes in this vulnerable group.",PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9548924,K02NS089852,"['2 year old', '5 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early identification', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor deficit', 'motor impairment', 'neonatal brain', 'neonatal period', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2018,137131,-0.005921979062167247
"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9568804,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,622284,0.010523182201512713
"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett). Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop new methods for screening for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It will exploit the wide availability and convenience of smartphone and tablet devices to detect the facial effects in children and adults and new ways of analyzing ultrasound images to detect facial and brain effects in the fetus. Our aim is to establish earlier detection so as to allow earlier intervention to improve outcome.",Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure,9524811,U01AA014809,"['3D ultrasound', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Fetus', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Neonatal', 'Nose', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pregnancy', 'Preparation', 'Printing', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Syndrome', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'age group', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'caudate nucleus', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'handheld equipment', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse model', 'neonatal period', 'novel', 'operation', 'postnatal', 'potential biomarker', 'prenatal', 'prenatal testing', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'tobacco exposure']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,U01,2018,262337,-0.03845400073805072
"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9524072,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Buprenorphine', 'Calcarine Sulcus', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methadone', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual attention', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive ability', 'critical period', 'drug of abuse', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal drug exposure', 'fetal opioid exposure', 'illicit opioid', 'imaging modality', 'in utero', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'joint attention', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'motor control', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid use', 'opioid use in pregnancy', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prescription opioid', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'standard of care', 'visual control', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,724280,0.021626876783453663
"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS This application is being submitted to PA-18-591 in accordance with NOT-OD-18-194. The proposed supplement INCLUDE project is entitled: “Upper Airway Structure and Function and Risk for OSA in Children with Down Syndrome”. The project is within the scope of R01 HL130468 entitled: “A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS” that focuses on implementing state-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during wake and sleep conditions (Aim 1A) using analytical and machine learning techniques to determine the static (3D) and dynamic (4D) architecture and tissue characteristics of the upper airway in wake and sleep conditions (Aim 1B). These methods are coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) (Aim 2A) and biomechanical modeling (Aim 2B) to establish the biomechanical basis of OSAS in children with obesity. The parent grant also evaluates the impact of treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on airway mechanics (Aim 3A) and the clinical utility of image-based airway mechanical parameters in OSAS (Aim 3B). The tools and methodologies used in the parent project will be integrated in all Aims of this INCLUDE project. The proposed project addresses 2 important IC-specific priorities of NHLBI: 1) “Incorporation of individuals with Down syndrome into existing disease cohorts and clinical trials directed toward sleep apnea. This could include collection of tissue or blood specimens and -omics data generation and analysis, imaging, and computational modeling”, 2) Identification of potential risk and resilience factors that make individuals with Down syndrome susceptible to transient or persistent blood disorders and congenital heart disease”. The problem: Down syndrome (DS) (trisomy 21) is the most common genetic cause of developmental disability and mental retardation with an incidence of 1/800 live births (1). The prevalence of OSA in these children is very high and estimated between 50-95% (2-5), and much higher than the 1-4% prevalence in the general pediatric population (6). OSA has detrimental consequences in children, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and cognitive effects (6). This is particularly true for children with Down syndrome who are already predisposed to congenital heart anomalies and developmental delay. Therefore, the American Academy of pediatrics (AAP) emphasizes the need to screen for OSA within the first 6 months of life in all children with Down syndrome and continue to evaluate for the disorder on all medical encounters thereafter throughout childhood (7). Anatomical factors related to the Down syndrome phenotype have been attributed to the causation of OSA in this group. These include midfacial and mandibular hypoplasia (8-11), enlarged tongue (12, 13), adenoid and tonsilar hypertrophy (13, 14), laryngo-tracheal anomalies (15), and obesity (16-19). In addition, reduced neuromuscular tone has been suspected of having a role in the development of OSA in these subjects (3). Traditional methods to evaluate the upper airway in children with DS include plain lateral neck radiograph, cephalometric measurements, airway fluoroscopy, and nasal pharyngoscopy (8, 15, 20, 21). However, these methods provide only limited information regarding the entire upper airway structure. During the years our group has developed,applied, and published seminal work on the upper airway structure and function of children using MRI methodology (22-35). This body of work on normal children and children with craniofacial abnormalities including DS created a large MRI database that is the basis for the current proposal. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9772627,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', 'Academy', 'Address', 'Airway Resistance', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Coupled', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Etiology', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematological Disease', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Live Birth', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mandible', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neck', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nose', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Tonsil', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiometabolism', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'design', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'parent grant', 'parent project', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'shear stress', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2018,420407,0.04869172366514354
"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5

"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%. Despite progress that has been made in recent years to understand the anatomical and functional attributes of OSAS in children, the precise mechanism leading to the disorder remains unknown in the majority of obese children, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to implement state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image analytics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomechanical modeling, to establish the biomechanical basis that leads to OSAS or protects from it, in naïve and treated children with obesity. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9481329,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'ROC Curve', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tonsil', 'Treatment outcome', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiometabolism', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2018,123110,0.0559485679962602
"Technology and Parent-Child Interaction PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Radesky is a board-certified Developmental Behavioral Pediatrician whose prior research and clinical work has focused on the importance of early childhood experiences in shaping long-term developmental and behavioral outcomes, particularly in low-income children. Her research has examined how digital media – including television and mobile devices such as smartphones – interacts with the early-parent child relationship, both being shaped by, and shaping, parenting behaviors and child social-emotional development. This mentored career development award will allow her to learn additional methodologies for assessing parent- child interaction and mobile device usage by parents. She has identified a comprehensive, trans-disciplinary mentoring team at the University of Michigan Departments of Pediatrics, Health Behavior and Health Education, Psychiatry, Psychology, Communications, and Informatics, as well as the Center for Human Growth and Development, to provide methodological and content expertise, including: Julie Lumeng, MD; Alison Miller, PhD; Katherine Rosenblum, PhD; Scott W. Campbell, PhD; and Mark Newman, PhD. This team of mentors and advisors will help guide her towards the following Training and Career Goals: 1. Develop working knowledge of theoretical models of parent-child interaction 2. Develop skills in using mobile devices to collect usage data and ecologic momentary assessment of parent  emotional states 3. Develop skills in research methods to assess parent-child interaction, including:  a) Behavioral coding of parent-child interaction from videotape  b) Language Environment Analysis (LENA) audiorecording to measure parent-child verbal interaction 4. Learn statistical analytic techniques unique to assessing parent-child interaction 5. Develop familiarity with the field of information science/human-computer interaction to inform future studies. Healthy social-emotional development in young children relies on sensitive, responsive parent-child interactions, particularly in children growing up in adversity. Screen media use is a highly prevalent behavior that may be a modifiable barrier to responsive parent-child interactions. Despite rapid increases in the use of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) by families with young children, there is a paucity of research examining associations between mobile device use and parent-child interactions. This research plan focuses on testing a conceptual model that parent and child traits predict how parents use mobile devices during family activities, and that certain features of this device use (particularly their emotional response to it) predict changes in parent-child interaction. This model also examines temporal contingencies in parent-child interaction and mobile device use, in order to help clarify directionality. This conceptual model will be tested through 3 Specific Aims: Aim 1) Test the hypotheses that parent depressive symptoms, lower parenting self-efficacy, higher parenting stress, and child difficult temperament and lower child emotion regulation are associated with higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use. Aim 2) Test the hypotheses that higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use are associated with less parent-child verbal exchange, lower parental responsivity, more parent-child conflict, and lower parent ability to read child behavioral cues. Aim 3) Determine whether changes in parent-child interaction (changes in parent and child affect, verbal exchange, parent responsivity, parent-child conflict, or parent ability to read child behavioral cues) occur before or after parent mobile device use. These Specific Aims will be carried out in two complementary cohorts: A) 296 low-income mother-child dyads enrolled in an existing cohort study with previously collected videotapes of home mealtimes, during which mobile devices are commonly used; and B) 100 parent-child dyads from a range of socioeconomic status backgrounds who will be followed for 4 days of data collection with continuous mobile device-based passive sensing of the parent's mobile device use, coordinated with simultaneous audiorecording of parent-child interaction using Language Environment Analysis (LENA) technology. Future Implications: The results from this work will contribute to an evidence base about how families can use the explosion of new media in their households in the healthiest ways possible, both through the formation of clinical guidelines and future interventional approaches. PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Despite the rapidly increasing ownership and use of mobile technology by parents and evidence showing that older technologies such as television displace important parent-child interactions, remarkably little research has examined the effects of mobile device use on families. This proposal examines which parent-child dyads are at highest risk of disturbances in parent-child interaction from mobile devices, how parent mobile device use precedes or follows changes in parent-child interactions, and the behavioral mechanisms underlying these associations. We anticipate that our findings will be applied to clinical guidelines for mobile device use by families, interventions to help improve parent-child engagement in the highest risk families, and the development of technologies that might be better designed to not intrude upon family time.",Technology and Parent-Child Interaction,9538823,K23HD092626,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Attention', 'Audiotape', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Caregivers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communication', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Familiarity', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Health education', 'Hearing', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Sciences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Observational Study', 'Ownership', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Provider', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Self Efficacy', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'career', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'digital media', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'irritation', 'mobile computing', 'pediatric department', 'pediatrician', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'skills', 'social', 'technology development', 'theories', 'trait']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2018,167319,0.019575185449699484
"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate. In this application, we propose to develop and assess the validity of an in-home objective, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system, called FLASH that has the potential to revolutionize the measurement of screen use behaviors.",Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH,9461051,R01DK113269,"['10 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'Asses', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral outcome', 'college', 'cost', 'diaries', 'field study', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity development', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'tv watching', 'validation studies']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,435074,-0.013192053188452357
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9514218,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,182298,0.011175509872551063
"Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders Project Summary: Early life psychosocial adversity and stress are well-established as the most powerful environmental risk factors for poor neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes in children. Impairments in developing emotion regulation and cognitive control and associated alterations in brain development have been shown to mediate the effects of adversity on risk for the development of psychopathology. Early psychosocial adversity impacts the epigenetic and inflammation-mediated processes that contribute to these negative outcomes, a process known as “biological embedding of stress.” While this risk trajectory has been clearly linked to increased rates of psychopathology, the mechanisms of this process, its targetable mediators and how early in development they operate are yet to be determined. Here we focus on the effects of early life adversity on brain, emotion regulation and cognitive control outcomes relevant to risk for mental disorders, beginning antenatally and extending to age 3. We will examine the role of pre- and postnatal adversity/stress, the maternal and child perinatal gut microbiome and early caregiver support on these key neurodevelopmental outcomes utilizing state-of-the-art neuroimaging. Our unifying hypothesis is that these factors modulate systemic inflammatory responses, induce neuronal effects through this and other processes that adversely impact brain development in limbic and cortical regions, and mediate the effects of early adversity on child emotion regulation, cognitive control and mental health outcomes. These factors will be studied in a unique, prospectively ascertained cohort of 370 mothers and their offspring at high psychosocial risk being recruited as part of an already funded March of Dimes project at Washington University. The cohort will include both term- and prematurely-born infants and toddlers given the increased risk of psychosocial adversity and aberrant gut microbiome in preterm children. The offspring will be intensively prospectively studied from the 1st trimester to age 3, providing a unique dataset in which to examine the interrelationships among pre- and postnatal adversity, biomarkers of inflammation, the gut microbiome and developmental and mental health outcomes. The perinatal and early childhood periods are critical times to study these exposures as adverse neurodevelopment associated with adversity begins in utero through fetal programming. Likewise, the perinatal period is a critical developmental window for microbial influences, when gut microbial colonization has its most enduring effects. The proposed study merges established research groups in these areas in a center with advanced infant and childhood neuroimaging and extensive microbiome expertise, and offers an unprecedented opportunity to understand the mechanisms of the biological embedding of adversity on brain, cognitive and emotional trajectories in a high-risk cohort. We will also apply innovative computational methods, using Deep Learning, to extend understanding of these data. Findings will provide critical and novel insights to inform early preventive interventions relevant to emotional, cognitive and mental health outcomes for children at greatest risk. Project Narrative This study will investigate the mechanisms by which psychosocial adversity experienced in utero and early in life impact the child’s brain, cognitive and emotional development, testing the hypothesis that stress and adversity during pregnancy adversely affect early brain development through inflammatory mechanisms. Another important focus of this project is to examine how the maternal perinatal microbiome and infant’s gut microbiome during early childhood impact brain development, either through the infant’s inflammatory response or other effects. A third focus is to explore the effects of caregiver support on this risk trajectory, testing the idea that high caregiver support reduces the negative influences of early adversity, altered immune biomarkers and disruptions in the gut microbiome.","Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders",9518320,R01MH113883,"['3 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caregiver support', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Funding', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informal Social Control', 'Instruction', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mothers', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Poverty', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'antenatal', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep learning', 'early childhood', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'fetal programming', 'gray matter', 'gut colonization', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'infant gut microbiome', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal microbiome', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiome', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal period', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,1996238,0.030888407402195527
"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual projects.",Administrative Core of the CIFASD,9524807,U24AA014811,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data management', 'diagnostic screening', 'drinking', 'eHealth', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'forging', 'health care service', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical research', 'program dissemination', 'recruit', 'repository', 'resilience', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web site']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2018,428830,-0.05978797430339266
"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities,9568765,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain shape', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'imaging potential', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multitask', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'premature neonates', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,392718,-0.004130137286922354
"A Direct Reading Video Assessment Instrument for Repetitive Motion Stress Project Summary/ Abstract This research studies if computer vision can more effectively evaluate worker exposure and assess the associated risk for work related injuries than conventional methods. Current methods involve either observations or measurements using instruments attached to a worker's hands or arms. Observation is often considered too subjective or inaccurate, and instruments too invasive or time consuming for routine applications in industry. Automated job analysis potentially offers a more objective, accurate, repeatable, and efficient exposure assessment tool than observational analysis. Computer vision uses less resources than instruments attached to workers and does not interfere with production; can quantify more exposure variables and interactions; is suitable for long-term, direct reading exposure assessment; and offers animated data visualizations synchronized with video for identifying aspects of jobs needing interventions. This research leverages the research from coordinated multi-institutional prospective studies of upper limb work related MSD conducted between 2001 and 2010 that studied production and service workers from a variety of US industries, and used rigorous case-criteria and individual-level exposure assessments prospectively, including recording detailed videos of the work. Our study partners from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Washington State Labor & Industries Safety & Health Assessment & Research for Prevention program and the University of California-San Francisco will provide task-level videos, associated exposure variable data, and prospective health outcomes for 1,649 workers. Exposure properties directly measured from videos of jobs and corresponding health outcomes from the prospective study database will establish dose-response relationships to translate into a prototype automated job analysis instrument. We build on our previous success in developing video marker-less hand motion algorithms for estimating the ACGIH hand activity level, and reliable video processing methods for hand tracking under challenging viewing conditions. This proposal will refine and develop additional video algorithms, and analyze the videos to extract exposure measures for repetition, posture, exertions, and their interactions. The video extracted exposure measures will be compared against conventional observational exposure measures made by our collaborators. Video and corresponding observational data will be merged with the prospective health outcomes data to evaluate dose-response and to develop and validate parsimonious exposure risk models for an automated direct reading repetitive motion instrument. We will test if automation has better predictive capability than observation and also consider the accuracy and utility of computer vision analysis against conventional job analysis for selected industrial jobs. This proposal addresses the NIOSH cross-sector programs in Musculoskeletal Disorders as well as in Exposure Assessment. This translational research is in concurrence with the Research to Practice (r2P) initiative by developing technology to disseminate knowledge from recent NIOSH sponsored prospective studies on MSDs.

"Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED) PROJECT SUMMARY In this application, I am requesting support from a career development award to support my research proposal titled “Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction”. I will be undertaking this work with the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Gordon (Primary US mentor) at the Washington University, St Louis and Dr. Asad Ali (Primary LMIC mentor) at the Aga Khan University. This project builds on our existing studies of Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED), funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The current application aims to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of EED by studying the evolution of gut microbial configuration in children who have clinical and histological evidence of EED. EED is common in children living in impoverished conditions with limited access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Histopathological changes of EED in small bowel mucosa include alteration in crypt to villous ratio along with lymphocytic infiltration of the villous epithelium and lamina propria. Although studies involving biopsies of small bowel mucosa are critical to study EED, these studies are uncommon because of logistic challenges involving performing endoscopies in field settings in LMICs. We have previously demonstrated in an ongoing BMGF funded study that we are able to safely obtain such biopsies, we now have a unique opportunity to study the relationship between gut microbiome evolution and EED in this cohort. The central hypothesis of the current application is that children with histological confirmation of EED have shared features of a bacterial community which is different from healthy controls and non-EED subjects, and that such changes in bacterial configuration are associated with enteric and systemic inflammation. For testing these hypotheses, evaluation of gut microbiome in healthy and stunted children will be carried out to identify the age discriminatory bacterial taxa in children with and without confirmation of EED. Dr. Gordon will be providing mentorship and experience in gut microbiome and microbiota analysis. Dr. Ali will provide the needed infrastructure of the field site and laboratory facilities, along with linking the microbiome analysis with clinical and histological outcomes of interest. The Aga Khan University is a leading regional research institute with multiple support systems for junior investigators which will be vital for my career transition as an independent scientist. My long term goal is to be the principal investigator of my own laboratory, focusing on studying the gut microbiome and its relationship with communicable and non-communicable diseases. I envision working on microbiota derived therapy for EED, and to find targets in the inflammatory pathways driven by changes in gut homeostasis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Globally, Pakistan has the third highest rate of stunting among children aged < 5 years. Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) is proposed to be a critical factor responsible for chronic growth faltering in children in resource limited settings. This research utilizes an innovative approach to study a program of postnatal gut microbiome development in children and its impact on child growth. This proposal will provide an ideal training platform for a translational scientist, covering the domains of mucosal immunology, histopathology, computational analysis, microbiome analysis and host immune responses. The skills learnt from this project will be critical for the capacity development of both the LMIC institution and the candidate herself.","Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED)",9549157,K43TW010697,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Duodenum', 'Endoscopy', 'Enteral', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Gut Mucosa', 'Height', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Homeostasis', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Institution', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lamina Propria', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Small Intestines', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Sustainable Development', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Villous', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aged', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'drinking water', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'fecal microbiota', 'forest', 'global health', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'host microbiome', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intestinal villi', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiota', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'skills', 'translational scientist']",FIC,AGA KHAN UNIVERSITY (PAKISTAN),K43,2018,62726,0.045209361799929716
"Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children Maternal substance use disorders are a substantial public health concern and the neurological consequences of prenatal exposure are a major threat to the long-term health of offspring. Globally, prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is between 2-7 and 20-50 per 1000, respectively. By contrast, in certain high-risk communities in South Africa, prevalence is reported to be as high as 63 and 155 per 1000, respectively. Though prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to affect the central nervous system, to date, little data exists in respect of the impact of PAE in early childhood, before both higher-level brain networks are established and other potentially confounding post- natal environmental influences have come into play. For neurodevelopmental disorders, studies have consistently shown that early intervention, based on detection and targeted interventions, leads to better long-term outcomes. We aim to address this precise gap in knowledge by imaging the brain and 3D face across the FASD continuum to investigate early biomarkers, trajectories and functional correlates of PAE in a cohort followed prospectively from birth to age 6 years. Data: Our cohort includes a well characterized subsample of children (PAE and healthy controls) enrolled in the Drakenstein Child Health Study in Cape Town, South Africa, who have been scanned as neonates and at 2-3 years of age. Preliminary published data shows highly significant relationships between PAE and regional gray and white matter changes, already discernible in newborns, well before the age FASD is typically diagnosed. An additional longitudinal assessment at 6-years will yield a unique FASD sample with 3 distinct time points (infants, toddlers and children), allowing characterization of brain and face morphology and brain structure and function in this previously understudied early developmental period. This proposal addresses fundamental gaps concerning the presence, timing and regional specificity of altered brain morphology and structural and functional connectivity in association with the effects of PAE on the developing brain from birth to 6 years, and the relationships with facial dysmorphology. The research team has successfully gathered data from the proposed cohort as neonates and at 2–3 years of age. The benefits of extending this research to a subsequent imaging time-point, with a larger range of developmental and neurobehavioral assessments, provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine longitudinal effects of PAE on the trajectory of the developing brain in these critical early years, the links between neural and face predictors of PAE and the long-term clinical significance of these findings. This research will illuminate early neurodevelopmental mechanisms leading to subsequent behavioral and neurological disturbances, which may allow opportunities for targeting interventions when brain plasticity is still relatively fluid. This project might also lead to new strategies for early diagnosis using both face and brain biomarkers. Project Narrative Fetal exposure of the brain to alcohol can trigger brain abnormalities that unfold over a lifetime with severe consequences both for the affected individual and for society at large. To date, these brain abnormalities and associated deficits and behaviors have mostly been studied in late childhood or later, with very few studies following the consequences of well documented fetal alcohol exposure as they develop in the same individual across time in early childhood when the brain is most responsive to potential treatments. This project will extend an ongoing study of children with fetal alcohol exposure, already characterized as newborns and at age 2-3 to add assessments of the brain and behavior at age 6 and will explore alcohol-induced facial abnormalities as a complementary predictor of brain problems. !",Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children,9576322,R01AA026834,"['2 year old', '3 year old', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neonatal', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'alcohol exposure', 'antenatal', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'efficacy testing', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal alcohol use', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal depression', 'multimodality', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal exposure', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'shape analysis', 'statistics', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,237359,-0.021150541473227428
"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,9553779,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA analysis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'dysbiosis', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'fecal microbiome', 'fecal microbiota', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gene complementation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'stool sample', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,619708,0.013361995923901504
"Secondary data analysis of universal autism screening in a large primary care network: The impact of early autism screening on age of diagnosis, referral, and entry into intervention (R03) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently highlighted the lack of studies examining universal autism screening in primary care and whether it leads to earlier diagnosis and treatment. This gap prevented them from being able to recommend universal autism screening until there is more evidence. CHOP has successfully implemented universal autism screening in primary care – 83% screening compliance in 2016, and has both screening and follow-up primary care available in the electronic health record. This proposal is for a secondary analysis of this data to directly answer the question of whether universal screening results in earlier identification and earlier treatment entry for children with autism. Preliminary analyses on 13,503 children found the sensitivity of the M-CHAT was surprisingly low -- 40% (specificity 94%, positive predictive value 16%, and negative predictive value of 98%). These results show that, with only one screen, more children with autism screened negative (n=198) than screened positive (n=128). This project will include a sample double this size (as more children age into the 4-6 year age range), and include the wealth of data within the EHR to accomplish two aims. Aim 1 will determine the age of diagnosis and entry into early intervention for children in a universal autism screening program. Many factors contribute to the age of diagnosis and intervention, but this dataset can answer three important questions: First, to determine the age of diagnosis and entry to intervention for children with autism who screened positive as toddlers at the first v. second screen (“true positives”). Second, to determine the age of diagnosis and early intervention for children who screened negative but went on to be diagnosed with autism (“false negatives”), since negative screening results can still lead to heightened awareness of milestones. Third, to explore the age of diagnosis and intervention for screened v. unscreened children, since a subset of children were not screened (approximately 17% of well-child visits, as well as some number of children who received sick care but did not present for well-child visits). Aim 2 will identify factors that would improve screening accuracy, and then create and validate a clinical decision tree. Pediatricians use clinical judgment to interpret screening results—this project can provide much needed evidence. Variables such as autism risk factors (e.g., family history); child demographic, medical, and developmental factors; family variables including socio-economic status and parent concerns; and practice-level variables including patient population demographics, provider years of experience, provider compliance with screening, and provider rates of referrals, could inform clinical judgment. Upon successful completion, this project will contribute the exact type of evidence from universal screening in primary care requested by the USPSTF, as well as provide guidance for pediatricians on how to fine tune their interpretation of screening results. This can significantly impact the age of diagnosis and intervention, by revealing for whom screening is and is not working well. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will analyze existing data from the highly successful universal autism screening program in our large primary care network. Our data can answer critical questions about the age of diagnosis, referral, and entry into intervention for children screened in primary care. We can also determine whether child, family, provider, and practice variables can be used to more accurately interpret early autism screening results.","Secondary data analysis of universal autism screening in a large primary care network: The impact of early autism screening on age of diagnosis, referral, and entry into intervention (R03)",9507401,R03MH116356,"['Academy', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'American', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Awareness', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Industry Standard', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Philadelphia', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Visit', 'aged', 'base', 'control trial', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'group intervention', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'patient population', 'pediatrician', 'premature', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rural setting', 'screening', 'screening program', 'secondary analysis', 'standard of care', 'urban setting']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R03,2018,86000,-0.008644267181787377
"Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria Project Summary: FASD is a serious public health crisis with 80,000 to 120,000 U.S. pregnancies per year at high risk. FASD diagnostic clinics are very sparse, difficult to sustain because of diagnostic complexity, unable to meet demand, and plagued by disagreement about diagnostic criteria. A recent comparison of five FASD diagnostic systems acknowledged that the lack of objective biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) contributes to disagreement in the field. The goal of the proposed work is to develop and refine neuroimaging methods capable of identifying subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE. A critical component of this project will be to apply these refined neuroimaging “biomarkers” to examine the validity and performance of the most commonly-used FASD diagnostic criteria (alcohol exposure, dysmorphology, growth, and cognition). The proposed project will push the development of imaging methods and will also include an examination of the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic factors. The aims are: 1) perform a comprehensive characterization of the FASD “connectome” using state-of- the-art Human Connectome Project (HCP) methods in children with PAE, 2) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FASD diagnostic criteria to provide objective evaluation of FASD criteria (which remain in flux), 3) characterize relationships between connectomics and cognitive functioning, & 4) examine the developmental course of functional connectivity, white matter connectivity, cortical gyrification, and intra-cortical myelin. Participants will undergo longitudinal re-assessment at 15-months to match the new HCP-development paradigm (HCP-D) to allow for comparison to a large normative dataset being collected in Minnesota as part of the HCP-D project. We will capitalize on the developments spawned from the $40 million HCP and will benefit from evaluating the brains of children with PAE against the backdrop of a very large HCP normative dataset (n=1300). The proposed study will examine 45 participants with PAE and 45 matched controls, ages 8-16, all of whom will be evaluated by the CIFASD dysmorphology project. Participants will undergo MRI scans at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at baseline and again 15 months later. The imaging protocol, which contains very high resolution structural, diffusion- weighted, and fMRI scans will evaluate cortical gyrification, intra-cortical myelin, white matter connectivity, and functional connectivity. Data from the HCP-D project will be used as secondary “normative” comparison dataset. We expect to find a number of subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE that have not previously been observed and we will characterize individuals with these metrics. Individual identification of neurodevelopmental anomalies will then allow us to probe the screening properties of commonly used FASD diagnostic criteria and to test the performance of Dr. Mattson's Decision Tree model for rapidly identifying children with developmental effects of PAE. The study will have direct implications for FASD clinical practice and public policies as it will provide objective data about the relative advantages and disadvantages of individual diagnostic elements and it will allow for comparisons of competing FASD diagnostic systems. The proposed project aims to use the most advanced MRI brain imaging techniques available to address a highly practical problem faced by clinicians and public health officials: the lack of consensus about diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and the challenges of identifying individuals who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but do not have the physical characteristics upon which a diagnosis can be made. The proposed study will identify subtle brain anomalies in children with PAE with a level of sensitivity not previously attainable. The study will push forward our understanding of how PAE negatively affects the efficiency of the brain's networks.

"Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies Project Summary Traditionally, environmental epidemiologic studies have focused on assessing risks related to a single pollutant at a time. This, however, does not reflect reality, since we are constantly exposed to multiple pollutants at once. It is very important, therefore, to be able to assess exposure to pollutant mixtures when conducting environmental epidemiologic methods. Doing so, however, is especially challenging, mainly due to the high dimension of the multi-pollutant exposure matrix (if the exposure of interest includes more than e.g. 5 or 10 chemicals) and because these pollutants are usually very highly correlated with each other. Although some methods are available to address these issues, they usually require strong assumptions and have severe limitations. With this study we propose to bypass most of these limitations by adapting and extending a novel and robust method to assess exposure to multiple pollutants, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). We will assess the performance of PCP synthetic datasets representing multiple potential scenarios and study designs, and compare our results to those obtained by existing methods. Subsequently, we will apply PCP to three important Public Health issues, i.e. to evaluate the associations between (i) in utero exposure to a mixture of PCBs and neurodevelopment, (ii) exposure to a metals mixture and cardiovascular health, and (iii) exposure to an air pollution mixture and emergency cardiovascular admissions. Finally, we will develop and share software so other researchers can freely use this novel, robust and flexible tool across a plethora of study designs and research questions. Our proposed work will be significant as it will provide epidemiologists with a novel and robust tool to assess exposure to environmental pollutant mixtures. Project Narrative We are constantly exposed to a mixture of environmental pollutants at once, but current epidemiologic methods either assess each pollutant separately, not capturing reality, or have severe limitations. With this study we propose to adapt a wildly popular method used in computer vision applications, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), and develop flexible extensions for many epidemiologic settings.

"PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH TIC DISORDERS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as 25% of all children have tics (brief, repetitive movements or noises) at some point, yet individuals have greatly varying prognoses. Even within the first year after tic onset, some children improve and experience no significant impairment, while others develop a chronic disorder (Tourette syndrome: TS) that can severely impinge upon their quality of life. Understanding the brain features present early in the course of TS that mediate or predict these different outcomes could revolutionize prognosis and treatment. The purpose of this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to provide the applicant with the training necessary to transition to independence with a research program focused on the brain mechanisms underlying TS and related disorders (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: ADHD, obsessive-compulsive disorder: OCD). The applicant's long-term goal is to identify predictive biomarkers that can help guide prognosis and treatment. In order to achieve such goals, the applicant will receive unparalleled mentorship by experts in TS and neuroimaging methodologies (Drs. K. Black, B. Schlaggar, E. Sowell, R. Poldrack, and T. Hershey) and will have access to superb clinical and imaging resources at Washington University. The proposed training plan will enable the applicant to achieve several short-term goals necessary to facilitate her long-term goals, including new training in structural MRI methods, advanced analytic strategies, and longitudinal study design, and continued training in resting state functional connectivity MRI and in the clinical aspects of TS and its comorbid conditions. These training goals will be advanced through the proposed research. First, supervised learning methods will be used to identify patterns of brain structure and function that can classify an individual child as having TS or not, providing a principled starting point for exploring predictive biomarkers (Aim 1). Second, unsupervised learning methods will be used to identify brain-based phenotypic subgroups of TS, helping to better account for the heterogeneity of TS (Aim 2). Finally, supervised learning methods will be used to predict symptom progression for children when they first present with tics, using longitudinal follow-up of children during ther first year after tic onset (Aim 3). Thus, the proposed project is a first step toward brain- based individualized predictions for children with tics. Notably, the proposed methods can be extended to other childhood neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., autism, ADHD), setting the stage for early treatment, as well as discovery of the underlying mechanisms. The longitudinal data collected as part of this award will be foundational for future R01 applications targeting the developmental trajectory of TS. The training and research plan proposed in this application will facilitate the applicant's transition to a unique and independent research career in translational developmental neuroscience. With a research program that employs multiple converging techniques and analysis methods to interrogate biomarkers of TS and related disorders, the applicant will continue to address research questions relevant to the NIMH throughout her independent career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Up to 25% of all children have tics (i.e., repetitive, purposeless movements or noises) at some point, yet these individuals have tremendously varying prognoses. Within the first year after tic onset, some children experience marked improvement and no significant impairment, while others develop a chronic disorder that can severely impinge upon their quality of life. Therefore, tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome (TS), would benefit highly from individualized predictions. Understanding the brain features present early in the course of TS that mediate or predict different outcomes could revolutionize prognosis and treatment. The proposed project is a first step toward brain-based individualized predictions for children with tics. More generally, the proposed methods may give insights into how to approach other neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).",PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH TIC DISORDERS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA,9504522,K01MH104592,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Flowcharts', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'analytical tool', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'career', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'developmental disease', 'disease classification', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized predictions', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,144559,-0.009349875399176762
"SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions}: According to the 2010 US census (http://www.census.gov/prod/2011 pubs/acsbr1 0-12. pdf) 2.8 million school-aged children (aged 5 to 17) suffer from some form of mental and/or physical disability. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) guarantees such children equal access to education. However, children aged 1 to 5, while even more in need of early rehabilitation therapy and social interaction, do not receive the same attention. This proposal describes a plan for developing a new paradigm for pediatric rehabilitation. The paradigm involves robots that interact socially with special needs children, within a closed feedback control loop. Its components include new methods for modeling and representation of children motion, visual activity recognition, machine learning and behavior adaptation, and general-sum game-theoretic analysis of human-robot interaction. The research groups in the two collaborating institutions, University of Delaware (UD) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), have produced preliminary results and evidence which suggest that the envisioned technical innovations in the domains mentioned above are feasible, and that physical implementation is possible.  There are three intertwined research thrusts in the proposed activity, that address specific long-standing challenges in each area: 1. pediatric rehabilitation: develop a robot-assisted, pediatric rehabilitation environment which combines motor training with social interaction; 2. computer vision and perception: develop interpretable perception and machine learning algorithms for adaptive activity recognition; 3. robot control: develop the control and coordination algorithms to enable directed and purposeful human-robot interaction. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Each year, 10 000 infants in the U.S. develop cerebral palsy and 4 000 infants have birth defects of the spine and the brain. The motor delays for these infants have lifelong consequences. This gap in mobility is a significant secondary impairment. We propose a new portable motor rehabilitation system with social robotic interfaces that maximizes rehabilitation dosage. The project will provide insights into motor development in special needs children suggesting a new early intervention paradigm for children with motor disabilities.",SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation,9348402,R01HD087133,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Censuses', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Dancing', 'Data', 'Delaware', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disabled Persons', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Feedback', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Perception', 'Physical activity', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Visual', 'aged', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cognitive disability', 'computer game', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'educational atmosphere', 'equipment training', 'human-robot interaction', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'motor rehabilitation', 'neuromuscular', 'peer', 'personalized medicine', 'physical therapist', 'portability', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'skeletal', 'social']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2017,477276,0.010023929818449467
"Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children Project Summary Access to diagnosis of autism and to invaluable early interventional therapy is severely hampered by the imbalance between the number of children needing care and the inadequate number of clinical practitioners who can deliver that care. This numerical imbalance is unlikely to change in the near future, and therefore there is an urgent need and an exciting opportunity to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers of children at risk for or with a diagnosis of autism, and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Using machine learning and large-scale data mining, we have built a mobile system to quantify and track the severity of autism that takes only minutes of a caregiver’s time and that has promise for repeat use at home due to its speed, accuracy and mobility. We have concomitantly developed a machine-learning system for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glass and delivers real time social cues to individuals with autism in that child’s natural environment. Our goal in this research program is to work with our clinical colleagues at Stanford’s Autism Center to test and refine these complementary machine-learning systems for accuracy and optimal use by families and their child with autism from their natural environments. We will then combine the two systems in a multi-month longitudinal trial designed to harness our mobilized machine learning tool to quantitatively measure the efficacy of our Autism Glasses as a therapeutic assistant that functions in real time and within the child’s natural environment. Our proposed experiments with at least 40 subjects at risk for developmental delay promise to demonstrate how to leverage digital health technologies to improve, mobilize and quicken the detection and treatment of autism. The work also will result in a new and unique dataset that validates the ability to bring the social learning process outside of the clinic and into the real world, leading to a faster, more fluid way for children with autism to gain social skills. We also expect our work to show how measurable indicators of behavioral improvement during therapy will facilitate the process of tracking progress on an increasingly more granular scale, and hopefully set the stage for more effective, precise and personalized treatment. Project Narrative There is a growing and striking imbalance between the number of clinical care providers and the number of children at risk for or managing an autism diagnosis, creating an urgent need to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Our research proposal is focused on building two complementary machine learning tools – one for rapid, mobile measurement of the autism phenotype and one for at-home social learning on Google Glasses – that we believe will open the diagnostic bottleneck and provide a valuable form of behavioral therapy that can be used at home and outside of the clinical setting.",Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children,9297669,R21HD091500,"['Address', 'Age', 'Android', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Therapeutics Program', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotions', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operating System', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Self-Direction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavior measurement', 'care delivery', 'clinical care', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'handheld equipment', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intervention program', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'prototype', 'social', 'social learning', 'social skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'trial design']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,196250,-0.022493601810891883
"A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health,9313526,K99ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K99,2017,96716,0.09755816505626665
"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. The proposed program will apply a novel dental biomarker of exposure to multiple chemicals and cutting-edge statistical methods to identify specific life stages including perinatal periods that correspond to increased susceptibility to neurodevelopmental effects of metal toxicant mixtures.",Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture,9338255,R01ES026033,"['8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Arsenic', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cadmium', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Nutrient', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deciduous tooth', 'developmental neurotoxicity', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2017,648832,0.06104793966156467
"Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health Project Summary  Decades of research suggest that neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage increases children's health risk. This proposed project seeks to address two major weaknesses in conventional neighborhood effects research and interventions: a) the assumption that residential neighborhoods function independently of each other - ignoring that risk factors in areas where people work, learn, and play away from home may interact with residential factors; and b) as importantly, insufficient understanding of neighborhood effects mechanisms and heterogeneity in effects. To systematically address these critical barriers in the field, I propose a research and training program that will enable me to learn, use, and adapt recent advancements in Big Data analytics. I plan to model hidden interdependencies among individuals and neighborhoods and operationalize mechanisms of neighborhood effects by drawing on multiple large datasets (demographic, geospatial, networks, population flows), with several hundred million observations across multiple states, cities, and years, and match them to locally and nationally representative restricted survey data. The massive volume, great variety, and unique complexity of such data, such as relational data on inter-neighborhood dependencies and interactions, pose a challenge to the standard capabilities of hardware, algorithms, and analytical methods and models of social and population science. The proposed training program in Big Data analytics and machine learning will enable me to overcome computational and conceptual challenges and uniquely position me to: a) examine the ecological inter-neighborhood networks (econetworks) to which population groups are differentially exposed to across space and time; and b) test new contextual mechanisms underlying children's exposures to health risks. Specifically, I propose to: a) develop computational models of dynamic large scale econetworks to assess population differences in exposures to health risk factors, as they commute daily between home and workplaces; b) examine heterogeneity in econetwork effects on child health using a hybrid design that links Big Data to local and national surveys; and c) model child health risk mechanisms and causal effects using natural experiments on Big Data. The proposed training program will enable me to learn and adapt Big Data analytics, draw on its strengths, but also address some of its key limitations. With the support of a unique team of distinguished mentors and advisors, established experts in Big Data analytics, spatial demography, network analysis, child development and health risk, neighborhood change, and population heterogeneity, I will embark on a training program that will uniquely enable me to address these research goals and position me to become an independent scholar and a leader in the field. Project Narrative This project contributes to advancing public health scholarship by leveraging and adapting Big Data analytical tools to overcome critical barriers in the field related to conventional assumptions about effects of neighborhood risk exposures on child health. It addresses the need to understand and model inter- neighborhood interdependencies and underlying multidimensional social capital mechanisms in order to better understand population heterogeneity in neighborhood effects on child health across space and time. The project also advances public health through an integration of rigorous social and data science methodology to create new measures and test causal hypotheses that advance our understanding of social capital forces that foster resilience to adversity and improve child health behavior and outcomes.",Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health,9431875,K01HD093863,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Businesses', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Rearing', 'Child health care', 'Cities', 'Collaborations', 'Commuting', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Demography', 'Dependency', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Drug usage', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health behavior outcomes', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Surveys', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'Social Work', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress and Coping', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Victimization', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'boys', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'low socioeconomic status', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'population health', 'programs', 'resilience', 'social capital', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'theories']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,K01,2017,139492,0.024586087000802476
"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.",The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders,9311704,R01MH104030,"['Advertisements', 'Age', 'Anniversary', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family history of', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuropsychology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'brain abnormalities', 'caudate nucleus', 'comparison group', 'critical period', 'dexterity', 'follow-up', 'habit learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical attention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomenological models', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'secondary analysis', 'vector']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,721638,0.043536355798403176
"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining sophisitcated data-analysis methods that use experiential and phenotypic heterogeneity together with longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral assessments in school-age children. This approach will increase precision when linking ECAs and child outcomes associated with the Research Domain Criteria constructs of Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS). The overarching goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the heterogeneous impact of ECAs on neurodevelopmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. This project's premise is that children exposed to ECAs have highly heterogeneous developmental histories as well as heterogeneous outcomes; therefore, prediction of ECA outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-driven approaches will 1) more precisely define NVS/CCS outcomes for school-aged children with ECAs, and 2) provide a more robust explanatory model for links between ECAs and NVS/CCS trajectories. Aim 1A subtypes children with a history of ECAs based on 2.5-year developmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. 300 6-8 year old children (250 sampled from previous institutional and foster care; 50 community comparisons) will provide neuroimaging, behavioral, and self/caregiver reports every 15 months for 2.5 years. Biclustering methods will be applied to the baseline and follow-up data to identify homogeneous NVS/CCS final outcome clusters of children. Aim 1B develops an explanatory model to predict developmental trajectory subtypes for children with ECAs, from early life profiles and brain/behavior phenotypes at the time of enrollment. Machine learning methods applied to early life profiles, baseline NVS/CCS profiles, and sex, will predict developmental trajectory subtypes. Aim 2 identifies adverse and protective life events during the 2.5-year assessment period that are predictive of 2.5-year follow-up outcomes for children with ECAs. The inclusion of child-sex and current life- events will identify potential divergence in pathways across middle childhood. This prospective design of children exposed to various ECAs is designed to develop predictive models for ECA trajectory subtypes and outcomes, which can inform our understanding of risk and protective factors in accord with the goals of precision medicine.   Project Narrative Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology, and it is estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining longitudinal multimodal brain imaging and high- dimensional behavioral assessments in school-age children together with sophisticated data analytic techniques to increase precision when linking heterogeneous ECAs and child outcome with the goal of predicting mental health outcomes and identifying children who would benefit most from specific early interventions.  ",Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities,9384268,R01MH091864,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Orphanages', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Violence', 'Visit', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'caregiving', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'foster care', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'middle childhood', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prepuberty', 'prospective', 'resilience', 'sex', 'socioeconomics']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2017,782745,0.0635301968414171
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9384304,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opiates', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,704051,0.008551337885397612
"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes. The goal is to identify imaging measures which identify preterm infants at risk for particular deficits, thereby allowing institution of timely therapies specific to each chid's needs and enabling larger research trials evaluating interventions designed to improve developmental outcomes in this vulnerable group.",PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9324377,K02NS089852,"['2 year old', '5 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early identification', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor deficit', 'motor impairment', 'neonatal brain', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2017,137131,-0.005921979062167247
"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9469790,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,613948,0.010523182201512713
"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution health effects on asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome parameters in especially vulnerable minority children populations.",Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework,9381203,K99ES027511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'African American', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'American', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'European', 'Exposure to', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Future', 'GALA', 'Genetic', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune System and Related Disorders', 'Immune system', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Latino', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Puerto Rican', 'Randomized', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'adverse outcome', 'analog', 'base', 'career', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic difference', 'experience', 'exposure pathway', 'health disparity', 'interest', 'minority children', 'pollutant', 'public health intervention', 'pulmonary function', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'social disparities', 'tool']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K99,2017,94114,0.005263458999385762
"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett). Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop new methods for screening for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It will exploit the wide availability and convenience of smartphone and tablet devices to detect the facial effects in children and adults and new ways of analyzing ultrasound images to detect facial and brain effects in the fetus. Our aim is to establish earlier detection so as to allow earlier intervention to improve outcome.",Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure,9391198,U01AA014809,"['3D ultrasound', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Fetus', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Neonatal', 'Nose', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pregnancy', 'Preparation', 'Printing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Syndrome', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'age group', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'caudate nucleus', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'handheld equipment', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'operation', 'postnatal', 'potential biomarker', 'prenatal', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'tobacco exposure', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,U01,2017,288909,-0.03845400073805072
"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5  percent of school-­aged children in the US. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of children with FASD and their  families can access FASD-­informed interventions due to significant systems-­ and family-­level barriers.  Research suggests that self-­directed and peer-­to-­peer interventions are acceptable to families and can lead to  significant improvements in parenting, child behavior, and resource utilization. Advancements in technology  are facilitating more accessible and interactive methods for self-­directed education and support. The proposed  project will develop and evaluate the efficacy of a novel mobile health (mHealth) application (“app”) to directly  provide caregivers with evidence-­based content and peer-­moderated support they can easily access and use  to improve outcomes for their children and families. The app, currently called “FMF Connect,” will be derived  from the scientifically-­validated Families Moving Forward (FMF) Program and will build on existing frameworks  for the development of medical apps. This project will follow a systematic approach to the development and  evaluation of the FMF Connect mHealth intervention, including a small-­scale feasibility trial (n=30), and a  larger-­scale hybrid implementation-­effectiveness trial (n=120) with caregivers raising children (ages 3-­12) with  FASD. Implementation data will aid in identifying the patterns of app usage that relate to the greatest  improvements in child and caregiver outcomes. Study hypotheses are: 1) that caregivers will find the FMF  Connect intervention acceptable, with easy to access content and encouraging support from peer-­moderators;;  2) that greater usage of specific intervention components will relate to larger improvements in child and  caregiver outcomes;; 3) that caregivers who receive the FMF Connect intervention will have larger gains on  child and caregiver outcomes relative to a waitlist comparison group;; and 4) that an increase in  neurodevelopmental attributions for behavior will mediate intervention-­related improvements in parenting  efficacy and child behavior. Project findings will guide further app development both in terms of content and  technological advances to optimize intervention effects. Results of this study will further the overall strategic  aims of the Collaborative Initiative on FASD (CIFASD), which are to inform and develop effective interventions

"Early understanding of multi-digit numbers Place value concepts and multi-digit numbers are the foundations of mathematics; however, many  children struggle at acquiring this knowledge. Poor understanding of the place value concepts has  been linked to difficulties in mathematics learning through the elementary and middle school  grades, and it is present not only for children with learning disabilities but also for a large  proportion of normally developing children. It is, thus, important to understand the developmental  mechanisms of multi-digit number learning and potential sources of early experiences that allow  some children to readily grasp the concepts while others continue to struggle. Recent research on place value concepts has suggested that children have partial knowledge of  multi-digit numbers at the preschool period, before receiving formal training from schools. These  precursors of multi-digit number knowledge can serve as important stepping-stones for children to  master the concept of place value once entering schools. However, there are at least two gaps in  our current understanding of the development  of place value concepts. First, how does early  understanding of multi-digit numbers relate to formal school training of the place value concepts?  Second, how do children come to acquire partial knowledge of multi-digit numbers at such a young  age in the first place? The goal of the proposed research aims at filling these gaps in the  literature with three specific aims. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that early knowledge of multi-digit  numbers is predictive of later school learning of the place value concepts. I propose to conduct a  3-year longitudinal study to measure children’s early understanding of multi-digit numbers at the  start and end of kindergarten, 1st  and 2nd grades. The study will test how early knowledge of  number names and written numerals, as well as other individual difference measurements (e.g., age,  gender, SES, number sense, home exposures to numbers),  relate to the learning of base-10  principles in grade school. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that acquiring early knowledge of  multi-digit numbers is a form of statistical learning, during which children extract latent  structures that govern the mapping between number words and written numerals through sparse  co-occurrence data. A training study is designed to give children casual experiences with  multi-digit numbers in engaging and child- friendly activities (e.g., picture-book reading, ipad  games). The same children in the statistical learning training will also be given formal school  training afterward, allowing us to assess and provide causal evidence for the hypothesis that early  knowledge prepares children for formal school training of the place value concepts. The knowledge  gained from this research will have implications for: a) determining the role of early knowledge of  multi-digit numbers in preparing children to learn about base-10 notation at schools; b) linking  statistical learning from sparse co-occurrence data about number words and multi-digit numbers to  early partial knowledge of place value; c) documenting how differences in early learning  environment (or input) may contribute to developmental inequalities in later school performances. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims at understanding the early development of multi-digit numbers, its learning mechanisms and its impact on formal school training of place value concepts. The period of development studied here, from 3 to 5 years of age, is a period during which sizable individual differences in multi-digit number knowledge starts to emerge, which may contribute to early developmental inequalities that limit the development of some children even after entering school. The proposed work is relevant to public health in that it will shed light on how differences in early learning environment lead to individual differences in early understanding of multi-digit numbers, potentially serving as the foundation for future early mathematical training programs.",Early understanding of multi-digit numbers,9394832,F32HD090827,"['5 year old', '6 year old', 'Age', 'Books', 'Child', 'Consequentialism', 'Correlation Studies', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Digit structure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inequality', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Names', 'Nursery Schools', 'Only Child', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preschool Child', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'early experience', 'educational atmosphere', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'first grade', 'formal learning', 'grasp', 'junior high school', 'kindergarten', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematics disability', 'second grade', 'socioeconomics', 'success']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F32,2017,56694,0.00024208241248843056
"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows Abstract: Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking. Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (PI) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals. By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 proposal builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health. In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study. Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities. Narrative: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking. Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This proposal will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",9189610,R00ES022986,"['13 year old', '4 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Burden', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Hair', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Nail plate', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'analytical tool', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deciduous tooth', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'forest', 'innovation', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'public health priorities', 'skills', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R00,2017,248999,0.08668249073120039
"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%. Despite progress that has been made in recent years to understand the anatomical and functional attributes of OSAS in children, the precise mechanism leading to the disorder remains unknown in the majority of obese children, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to implement state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image analytics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomechanical modeling, to establish the biomechanical basis that leads to OSAS or protects from it, in naïve and treated children with obesity. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9327032,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'ROC Curve', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tonsil', 'Treatment outcome', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2017,757906,0.0559485679962602
"Technology and Parent-Child Interaction PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Radesky is a board-certified Developmental Behavioral Pediatrician whose prior research and clinical work has focused on the importance of early childhood experiences in shaping long-term developmental and behavioral outcomes, particularly in low-income children. Her research has examined how digital media – including television and mobile devices such as smartphones – interacts with the early-parent child relationship, both being shaped by, and shaping, parenting behaviors and child social-emotional development. This mentored career development award will allow her to learn additional methodologies for assessing parent- child interaction and mobile device usage by parents. She has identified a comprehensive, trans-disciplinary mentoring team at the University of Michigan Departments of Pediatrics, Health Behavior and Health Education, Psychiatry, Psychology, Communications, and Informatics, as well as the Center for Human Growth and Development, to provide methodological and content expertise, including: Julie Lumeng, MD; Alison Miller, PhD; Katherine Rosenblum, PhD; Scott W. Campbell, PhD; and Mark Newman, PhD. This team of mentors and advisors will help guide her towards the following Training and Career Goals: 1. Develop working knowledge of theoretical models of parent-child interaction 2. Develop skills in using mobile devices to collect usage data and ecologic momentary assessment of parent  emotional states 3. Develop skills in research methods to assess parent-child interaction, including:  a) Behavioral coding of parent-child interaction from videotape  b) Language Environment Analysis (LENA) audiorecording to measure parent-child verbal interaction 4. Learn statistical analytic techniques unique to assessing parent-child interaction 5. Develop familiarity with the field of information science/human-computer interaction to inform future studies. Healthy social-emotional development in young children relies on sensitive, responsive parent-child interactions, particularly in children growing up in adversity. Screen media use is a highly prevalent behavior that may be a modifiable barrier to responsive parent-child interactions. Despite rapid increases in the use of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) by families with young children, there is a paucity of research examining associations between mobile device use and parent-child interactions. This research plan focuses on testing a conceptual model that parent and child traits predict how parents use mobile devices during family activities, and that certain features of this device use (particularly their emotional response to it) predict changes in parent-child interaction. This model also examines temporal contingencies in parent-child interaction and mobile device use, in order to help clarify directionality. This conceptual model will be tested through 3 Specific Aims: Aim 1) Test the hypotheses that parent depressive symptoms, lower parenting self-efficacy, higher parenting stress, and child difficult temperament and lower child emotion regulation are associated with higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use. Aim 2) Test the hypotheses that higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use are associated with less parent-child verbal exchange, lower parental responsivity, more parent-child conflict, and lower parent ability to read child behavioral cues. Aim 3) Determine whether changes in parent-child interaction (changes in parent and child affect, verbal exchange, parent responsivity, parent-child conflict, or parent ability to read child behavioral cues) occur before or after parent mobile device use. These Specific Aims will be carried out in two complementary cohorts: A) 296 low-income mother-child dyads enrolled in an existing cohort study with previously collected videotapes of home mealtimes, during which mobile devices are commonly used; and B) 100 parent-child dyads from a range of socioeconomic status backgrounds who will be followed for 4 days of data collection with continuous mobile device-based passive sensing of the parent's mobile device use, coordinated with simultaneous audiorecording of parent-child interaction using Language Environment Analysis (LENA) technology. Future Implications: The results from this work will contribute to an evidence base about how families can use the explosion of new media in their households in the healthiest ways possible, both through the formation of clinical guidelines and future interventional approaches. PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Despite the rapidly increasing ownership and use of mobile technology by parents and evidence showing that older technologies such as television displace important parent-child interactions, remarkably little research has examined the effects of mobile device use on families. This proposal examines which parent-child dyads are at highest risk of disturbances in parent-child interaction from mobile devices, how parent mobile device use precedes or follows changes in parent-child interactions, and the behavioral mechanisms underlying these associations. We anticipate that our findings will be applied to clinical guidelines for mobile device use by families, interventions to help improve parent-child engagement in the highest risk families, and the development of technologies that might be better designed to not intrude upon family time.",Technology and Parent-Child Interaction,9371547,K23HD092626,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Attention', 'Audiotape', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Caregivers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communication', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Familiarity', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Health education', 'Hearing', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Sciences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Observational Study', 'Ownership', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Provider', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Self Efficacy', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'career', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'digital media', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'irritation', 'mobile computing', 'pediatric department', 'pediatrician', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'skills', 'social', 'technology development', 'theories', 'trait']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2017,167135,0.019575185449699484
"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate. In this application, we propose to develop and assess the validity of an in-home objective, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system, called FLASH that has the potential to revolutionize the measurement of screen use behaviors.",Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH,9288252,R01DK113269,"['10 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'Asses', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child health care', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral outcome', 'college', 'cost', 'diaries', 'field study', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'tv watching', 'validation studies']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,450361,-0.013192053188452357
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9354508,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,201353,0.011175509872551063
"Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED) PROJECT SUMMARY In this application, I am requesting support from a career development award to support my research proposal titled “Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction”. I will be undertaking this work with the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Gordon (Primary US mentor) at the Washington University, St Louis and Dr. Asad Ali (Primary LMIC mentor) at the Aga Khan University. This project builds on our existing studies of Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED), funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The current application aims to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of EED by studying the evolution of gut microbial configuration in children who have clinical and histological evidence of EED. EED is common in children living in impoverished conditions with limited access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Histopathological changes of EED in small bowel mucosa include alteration in crypt to villous ratio along with lymphocytic infiltration of the villous epithelium and lamina propria. Although studies involving biopsies of small bowel mucosa are critical to study EED, these studies are uncommon because of logistic challenges involving performing endoscopies in field settings in LMICs. We have previously demonstrated in an ongoing BMGF funded study that we are able to safely obtain such biopsies, we now have a unique opportunity to study the relationship between gut microbiome evolution and EED in this cohort. The central hypothesis of the current application is that children with histological confirmation of EED have shared features of a bacterial community which is different from healthy controls and non-EED subjects, and that such changes in bacterial configuration are associated with enteric and systemic inflammation. For testing these hypotheses, evaluation of gut microbiome in healthy and stunted children will be carried out to identify the age discriminatory bacterial taxa in children with and without confirmation of EED. Dr. Gordon will be providing mentorship and experience in gut microbiome and microbiota analysis. Dr. Ali will provide the needed infrastructure of the field site and laboratory facilities, along with linking the microbiome analysis with clinical and histological outcomes of interest. The Aga Khan University is a leading regional research institute with multiple support systems for junior investigators which will be vital for my career transition as an independent scientist. My long term goal is to be the principal investigator of my own laboratory, focusing on studying the gut microbiome and its relationship with communicable and non-communicable diseases. I envision working on microbiota derived therapy for EED, and to find targets in the inflammatory pathways driven by changes in gut homeostasis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Globally, Pakistan has the third highest rate of stunting among children aged < 5 years. Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) is proposed to be a critical factor responsible for chronic growth faltering in children in resource limited settings. This research utilizes an innovative approach to study a program of postnatal gut microbiome development in children and its impact on child growth. This proposal will provide an ideal training platform for a translational scientist, covering the domains of mucosal immunology, histopathology, computational analysis, microbiome analysis and host immune responses. The skills learnt from this project will be critical for the capacity development of both the LMIC institution and the candidate herself.","Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED)",9402123,K43TW010697,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Duodenum', 'Endoscopy', 'Enteral', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Height', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Homeostasis', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lamina Propria', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Small Intestines', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Sustainable Development', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Villous', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'drinking water', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'forest', 'global health', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intestinal villi', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'skills', 'translational scientist']",FIC,AGA KHAN UNIVERSITY (PAKISTAN),K43,2017,57663,0.045209361799929716
"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities,9397322,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain shape', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'imaging potential', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multitask', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'premature neonates', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,435809,-0.004130137286922354
"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual projects.",Administrative Core of the CIFASD,9390289,U24AA014811,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data management', 'diagnostic screening', 'drinking', 'eHealth', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'forging', 'health care service', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical research', 'program dissemination', 'repository', 'resilience', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web site']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2017,401580,-0.05978797430339266
"A Direct Reading Video Assessment Instrument for Repetitive Motion Stress Project Summary/ Abstract This research studies if computer vision can more effectively evaluate worker exposure and assess the associated risk for work related injuries than conventional methods. Current methods involve either observations or measurements using instruments attached to a worker's hands or arms. Observation is often considered too subjective or inaccurate, and instruments too invasive or time consuming for routine applications in industry. Automated job analysis potentially offers a more objective, accurate, repeatable, and efficient exposure assessment tool than observational analysis. Computer vision uses less resources than instruments attached to workers and does not interfere with production; can quantify more exposure variables and interactions; is suitable for long-term, direct reading exposure assessment; and offers animated data visualizations synchronized with video for identifying aspects of jobs needing interventions. This research leverages the research from coordinated multi-institutional prospective studies of upper limb work related MSD conducted between 2001 and 2010 that studied production and service workers from a variety of US industries, and used rigorous case-criteria and individual-level exposure assessments prospectively, including recording detailed videos of the work. Our study partners from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Washington State Labor & Industries Safety & Health Assessment & Research for Prevention program and the University of California-San Francisco will provide task-level videos, associated exposure variable data, and prospective health outcomes for 1,649 workers. Exposure properties directly measured from videos of jobs and corresponding health outcomes from the prospective study database will establish dose-response relationships to translate into a prototype automated job analysis instrument. We build on our previous success in developing video marker-less hand motion algorithms for estimating the ACGIH hand activity level, and reliable video processing methods for hand tracking under challenging viewing conditions. This proposal will refine and develop additional video algorithms, and analyze the videos to extract exposure measures for repetition, posture, exertions, and their interactions. The video extracted exposure measures will be compared against conventional observational exposure measures made by our collaborators. Video and corresponding observational data will be merged with the prospective health outcomes data to evaluate dose-response and to develop and validate parsimonious exposure risk models for an automated direct reading repetitive motion instrument. We will test if automation has better predictive capability than observation and also consider the accuracy and utility of computer vision analysis against conventional job analysis for selected industrial jobs. This proposal addresses the NIOSH cross-sector programs in Musculoskeletal Disorders as well as in Exposure Assessment. This translational research is in concurrence with the Research to Practice (r2P) initiative by developing technology to disseminate knowledge from recent NIOSH sponsored prospective studies on MSDs.

"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,9349480,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA analysis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gene complementation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,619708,0.013361995923901504
"Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria Project Summary: FASD is a serious public health crisis with 80,000 to 120,000 U.S. pregnancies per year at high risk. FASD diagnostic clinics are very sparse, difficult to sustain because of diagnostic complexity, unable to meet demand, and plagued by disagreement about diagnostic criteria. A recent comparison of five FASD diagnostic systems acknowledged that the lack of objective biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) contributes to disagreement in the field. The goal of the proposed work is to develop and refine neuroimaging methods capable of identifying subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE. A critical component of this project will be to apply these refined neuroimaging “biomarkers” to examine the validity and performance of the most commonly-used FASD diagnostic criteria (alcohol exposure, dysmorphology, growth, and cognition). The proposed project will push the development of imaging methods and will also include an examination of the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic factors. The aims are: 1) perform a comprehensive characterization of the FASD “connectome” using state-of- the-art Human Connectome Project (HCP) methods in children with PAE, 2) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FASD diagnostic criteria to provide objective evaluation of FASD criteria (which remain in flux), 3) characterize relationships between connectomics and cognitive functioning, & 4) examine the developmental course of functional connectivity, white matter connectivity, cortical gyrification, and intra-cortical myelin. Participants will undergo longitudinal re-assessment at 15-months to match the new HCP-development paradigm (HCP-D) to allow for comparison to a large normative dataset being collected in Minnesota as part of the HCP-D project. We will capitalize on the developments spawned from the $40 million HCP and will benefit from evaluating the brains of children with PAE against the backdrop of a very large HCP normative dataset (n=1300). The proposed study will examine 45 participants with PAE and 45 matched controls, ages 8-16, all of whom will be evaluated by the CIFASD dysmorphology project. Participants will undergo MRI scans at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at baseline and again 15 months later. The imaging protocol, which contains very high resolution structural, diffusion- weighted, and fMRI scans will evaluate cortical gyrification, intra-cortical myelin, white matter connectivity, and functional connectivity. Data from the HCP-D project will be used as secondary “normative” comparison dataset. We expect to find a number of subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE that have not previously been observed and we will characterize individuals with these metrics. Individual identification of neurodevelopmental anomalies will then allow us to probe the screening properties of commonly used FASD diagnostic criteria and to test the performance of Dr. Mattson's Decision Tree model for rapidly identifying children with developmental effects of PAE. The study will have direct implications for FASD clinical practice and public policies as it will provide objective data about the relative advantages and disadvantages of individual diagnostic elements and it will allow for comparisons of competing FASD diagnostic systems. The proposed project aims to use the most advanced MRI brain imaging techniques available to address a highly practical problem faced by clinicians and public health officials: the lack of consensus about diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and the challenges of identifying individuals who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but do not have the physical characteristics upon which a diagnosis can be made. The proposed study will identify subtle brain anomalies in children with PAE with a level of sensitivity not previously attainable. The study will push forward our understanding of how PAE negatively affects the efficiency of the brain's networks. In addition, the study will use these brain imaging results to further refine the diagnostic criteria such that more children will be able to be properly identified as having a neurodevelopmental disorder as a result of PAE.",Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria,9390704,U01AA026102,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dysmorphology', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Myelin', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structural defect', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'connectome', 'diffusion weighted', 'executive function', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'performance tests', 'prisma', 'processing speed', 'screening', 'white matter']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2017,337918,-0.005079775349654817

"SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions}: According to the 2010 US census (http://www.census.gov/prod/2011 pubs/acsbr1 0-12. pdf) 2.8 million school-aged children (aged 5 to 17) suffer from some form of mental and/or physical disability. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) guarantees such children equal access to education. However, children aged 1 to 5, while even more in need of early rehabilitation therapy and social interaction, do not receive the same attention. This proposal describes a plan for developing a new paradigm for pediatric rehabilitation. The paradigm involves robots that interact socially with special needs children, within a closed feedback control loop. Its components include new methods for modeling and representation of children motion, visual activity recognition, machine learning and behavior adaptation, and general-sum game-theoretic analysis of human-robot interaction. The research groups in the two collaborating institutions, University of Delaware (UD) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), have produced preliminary results and evidence which suggest that the envisioned technical innovations in the domains mentioned above are feasible, and that physical implementation is possible.  There are three intertwined research thrusts in the proposed activity, that address specific long-standing challenges in each area: 1. pediatric rehabilitation: develop a robot-assisted, pediatric rehabilitation environment which combines motor training with social interaction; 2. computer vision and perception: develop interpretable perception and machine learning algorithms for adaptive activity recognition; 3. robot control: develop the control and coordination algorithms to enable directed and purposeful human-robot interaction. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Each year, 10 000 infants in the U.S. develop cerebral palsy and 4 000 infants have birth defects of the spine and the brain. The motor delays for these infants have lifelong consequences. This gap in mobility is a significant secondary impairment. We propose a new portable motor rehabilitation system with social robotic interfaces that maximizes rehabilitation dosage. The project will provide insights into motor development in special needs children suggesting a new early intervention paradigm for children with motor disabilities.",SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation,9146176,R01HD087133,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Censuses', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Dancing', 'Data', 'Delaware', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Feedback', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Perception', 'Physical activity', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Visual', 'Visual Motion', 'Weight', 'aged', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cognitive disability', 'computer game', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'educational atmosphere', 'equipment training', 'human-robot interaction', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'learned behavior', 'meetings', 'motor rehabilitation', 'neuromuscular', 'peer', 'personalized medicine', 'physical therapist', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'skeletal', 'social', 'technology training']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2016,477724,0.010023929818449467
"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health.

"PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH NEW-ONSET TICS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorders are often debilitating and are increasing in prevalence. Tourette Syndrome/Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD), we propose, has a course that lends itself especially well to discovering optimal strategies for early diagnosis and prevention of developmental disorders. Common clinical practice and epidemiological data suggest that a large fraction (10-25%) of all children manifest motor and/or vocal tics at some age. Yet only 1-3% of all children have tics for the full year required for diagnosis of TS/CTD. The objective of the proposed research is to understand the structural and functional neuroimaging features of children with new-onset tics (""New Tics""), as the neurobiology of this population has not been investigated. Studying children with New Tics should provide the most leverage in understanding why tics remit in some children but not others. This proposal compares neuroimaging features of New Tics to TS/CTD and to controls, implements machine-learning tools to predict whether children with New Tics will remit or develop TS/CTD, and utilizes longitudinal scans to identify within-subject changes that occur as tics remit or persist.  The proposed study will apply resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs fcMRI) and structural MRI methods to investigate children with New Tics. Neuroimaging will be conducted on children with current, new- onset tics, and comparisons will be made to existing MRI data from children with diagnosed TS/CTD and controls. Follow-up evaluation (1 year after tic onset) of New Tics will allow us to identify which children's tics remitted completely and whic were actually in the earliest stages of TS/CTD, thus sorting this group into Remitted Tics and Converted TS/CTD subgroups. Based on the epidemiological data, we expect most of New Tics subjects to fall in the Remitted Tics subgroup. Longitudinal scans of the New Tics children will enable us to assess within-subject changes that occur with remittance or persistence of tics. This study will also apply machine learning tools, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVMs), to characterize features that distinguish Remitted Tics and Existing TS/CTD groups. Those features will then be used to predict whether tics in the New Tics group will remit (Remitted Tics) or persist (Converted TS/CTD) on an individual patient basis. Thus, we will be poised to identify differences, and potentially early predictors, of remittance and TS/CTD.  This study will provide innovative, important data on a common clinical presentation: the child with New Tics. Completing our aims successfully will allow individual prediction of remission or progression, or at least will allow a New Tics sample to be enriched for high risk of developing TS/CTD, which would make prevention studies for TS/CTD feasible. We will also gain insight into the neurobiology of New Tics. Finally, this study is an essential first step towards a definitive longitudinal study that can improve diagnostic accuracy and settle questions of cause and effect. With successful completion of our aims, similar methods can be applied to other childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorders, setting the stage for early treatment or prevention of chronicity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Roughly 1 out of 5 school age children will develop tics, i.e. repetitive, purposeless movements or noises. However, only about 3% of all children have a chronic tic disorder, such as Tourette syndrome (TS), so tics are transient (lasting less than 1 year) in most children with tics. Tics can cause significant morbidity and adversely affect quality of life. It is of great clinical and scientific interest to be able to predict which child with newonset of tics will go on to have morbidity from chronic tics, and understanding of the neurobiology of transient tics has an excellent chance of improving our ability to manage these patients and perhaps even prevent development of TS. More generally, this approach may give insights into how to approach other neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism.",PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH NEW-ONSET TICS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA,8995710,R21NS091635,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Remittance', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'School-Age Population', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Tic disorder', 'Transient Tics', 'Vocal Tics', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prevent', 'tool', 'unpublished works']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,190625,0.05039296995176057
"Real-Time Prediction of Acute Arrest in Infants with Single Ventricle Physiology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use; (2) To improve the performance of this algorithm by incorporating additional sensor technologies; (3) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post-surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a validation study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 and 3 focus on improving the detection accuracy of the algorithm using Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring, and relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Real-Time Prediction of Acute Arrest in Infants with Single Ventricle Physiology,9324456,R56HL131574,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Common Ventricle', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Infant', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Surgery', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Staging', 'Surgical complication', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'infancy', 'mortality', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'technology/technique', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R56,2016,277123,0.04144929158304547
"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes. The goal is to identify imaging measures which identify preterm infants at risk for particular deficits, thereby allowing institution of timely therapies specific to each chid's needs and enabling larger research trials evaluating interventions designed to improve developmental outcomes in this vulnerable group.",PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9118361,K02NS089852,"['2 year old', '5 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early identification', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor deficit', 'motor impairment', 'neonatal brain', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'research study', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2016,191131,-0.005921979062167247
"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%. Despite progress that has been made in recent years to understand the anatomical and functional attributes of OSAS in children, the precise mechanism leading to the disorder remains unknown in the majority of obese children, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to implement state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image analytics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomechanical modeling, to establish the biomechanical basis that leads to OSAS or protects from it, in naïve and treated children with obesity. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9176080,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', 'Adenoidal structure', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tonsil', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2016,788036,0.0559485679962602
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9197901,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Proxy', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'trafficking', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2016,199585,0.011175509872551063

"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows Abstract: Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking. Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (PI) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals. By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 proposal builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health. In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study. Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities. Narrative: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking. Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This proposal will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",9026614,R00ES022986,"['13 year old', '4 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Burden', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Hair', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Nail plate', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'abstracting', 'analytical tool', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deciduous tooth', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'forest', 'innovation', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'public health priorities', 'skills', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R00,2016,248999,0.08668249073120039
"A preschool biomarker for literacy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as one in ten children have the poor reading and spelling skills that comprise developmental dyslexia. It is widely accepted that there is a neurological basis; however, the nature of that basis is hotly debated. Nevertheless, one consistent view is that poor phonological processing-the ability to access and manipulate the sound units of language-is involved in dyslexia. Indeed, a majority of children with reading deficits exhibit difficulties on an array of phonological processing tasks. A growing body of research has discovered that speech-sound transcription, as measured by electrophysiology, shows striking relationships with phonological processing skills and reading ability in school-age children. As such, we have developed a suite of subcortical and cortical physiological tests that probe some of the core deficits that researchers have postulated as the root elements of poor phonological processing. We will target the subcortical processing of time-varying signals and stimulus regularities, and cortical hemispheric specialization to both fast and slow signals. In a longitudinal cohort of four- to eight-year-olds, we will model the normal neurological speech transcription process, quantify its development, and examine its relationship with the development of literacy-related skills. Our intention is that by leveraging these electrophysiological probes to a pre-reading age group, a biomarker, in preschoolers, may be found that predicts a child's eventual reading skill as he/she progresses through the primary grades. If such a biomarker is found, it would pave the way for earlier and more effectively targeted intervention. As objective neurophysiological measures of literacy become available, a logical step is to apply what has been learned about subcortical and cortical physiology and their relationships with reading to young pre- readers. The outcome of the proposed work will be a deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings of literacy, particularly in pre-literate children, and a means to exploit objective biological responses as biomarkers of future literacy. This outcome will positively impact our understanding of the core deficits leading to poor reading, and has the potential to spur early intervention programs to head off the potential onset of developmental dyslexia.",A preschool biomarker for literacy,9032506,R01HD069414,"['4 year old', '8 year old', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Brainstem Responses', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Stem', 'Cerebral Dominance', 'Child', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental reading disorder', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Employee Strikes', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Financial cost', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Schools', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reading Disorder', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcription Process', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'age group', 'auditory pathway', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive skill', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'corticofugal fiber', 'experience', 'falls', 'intervention program', 'literacy', 'literate', 'neurophysiology', 'peer', 'phonology', 'reading ability', 'reading difficulties', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'sound', 'spelling', 'stimulus processing']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,373707,0.031061766260540125
"A Direct Reading Video Assessment Instrument for Repetitive Motion Stress Project Summary/ Abstract This research studies if computer vision can more effectively evaluate worker exposure and assess the associated risk for work related injuries than conventional methods. Current methods involve either observations or measurements using instruments attached to a worker's hands or arms. Observation is often considered too subjective or inaccurate, and instruments too invasive or time consuming for routine applications in industry. Automated job analysis potentially offers a more objective, accurate, repeatable, and efficient exposure assessment tool than observational analysis. Computer vision uses less resources than instruments attached to workers and does not interfere with production; can quantify more exposure variables and interactions; is suitable for long-term, direct reading exposure assessment; and offers animated data visualizations synchronized with video for identifying aspects of jobs needing interventions. This research leverages the research from coordinated multi-institutional prospective studies of upper limb work related MSD conducted between 2001 and 2010 that studied production and service workers from a variety of US industries, and used rigorous case-criteria and individual-level exposure assessments prospectively, including recording detailed videos of the work. Our study partners from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Washington State Labor & Industries Safety & Health Assessment & Research for Prevention program and the University of California-San Francisco will provide task-level videos, associated exposure variable data, and prospective health outcomes for 1,649 workers. Exposure properties directly measured from videos of jobs and corresponding health outcomes from the prospective study database will establish dose-response relationships to translate into a prototype automated job analysis instrument. We build on our previous success in developing video marker-less hand motion algorithms for estimating the ACGIH hand activity level, and reliable video processing methods for hand tracking under challenging viewing conditions. This proposal will refine and develop additional video algorithms, and analyze the videos to extract exposure measures for repetition, posture, exertions, and their interactions. The video extracted exposure measures will be compared against conventional observational exposure measures made by our collaborators. Video and corresponding observational data will be merged with the prospective health outcomes data to evaluate dose-response and to develop and validate parsimonious exposure risk models for an automated direct reading repetitive motion instrument. We will test if automation has better predictive capability than observation and also consider the accuracy and utility of computer vision analysis against conventional job analysis for selected industrial jobs. This proposal addresses the NIOSH cross-sector programs in Musculoskeletal Disorders as well as in Exposure Assessment.

"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,9134726,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'routine care', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,653525,0.013361995923901504
"Improving Accuracy and Accessibility of Early Autism Screening DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism is prevalent (1 in 50 children) and impairing but early intervention has been shown to improve outcomes prompting recommendations for screening at both two year and 18 month health check-ups. Detection of autism early is crucial but accurate screening tools have been elusive. In Phase II, a practical method of improving accuracy of M-CHAT, the most widely used autism screen, was created by adapting the validated and recommended follow up interview, M-CHAT F/Ui (F/U), for efficient use during the visit. In the case of a positive screen, the primary care provider (PCP) can use CHADIS, a web-based questionnaire delivery, decision support and post-visit engagement system, to conduct F/U rather than requiring a visit with another professional. Phase II data showed F/U results by a PCP were equivalent to the autism center. Phase-II data on the M-CHAT plus F/U via CHADIS replicated findings of the F/U authors in showing both excellent positive predictive value (PPV) 0.96 for children >20 months (thus effective for 24 month olds) and also low PPV 0.54 for <20 months. Promisingly, Phase II exploratory analyses using a decision tree including supplementary data from a routinely used standard language screen (ASQ communication scale) and an item from a language measure (MCDI) plus the standard autism screen (M-CHAT plus F/U) reached PPV of 0.95 in the <20 month group. This screen completion could be done efficiently online by parents. Phase IIB plans a replication of this screening procedure which promises to be accurate for 18 month olds and comparison to alternatives using the community network of >400 Maryland doctors where >22,000 autism screens have been done using the CHADIS system. A more accurate screening test is of less value if it is not universally used. In Phase II, an approach was developed that reduces disparities in access to screening using a ""talking"" tablet kiosk that was preferred by parents to alternatives, but further workflow issues will be addressed in Phase IIB. To improve screen completion, we will program an automated reminder/completion confirmation text/email system in CHADIS with coupons as incentives for parents. In Phase II, CHADIS was adapted to capture both patient input and doctor decision-making and Maintenance of Certification (MOC) accreditation was awarded by the American Board of Pediatrics for this program and earned by 140 pediatricians. This monthly doctor quality improvement program will be extended to a daily continuous quality improvement process for the whole office team to further assure patient participation in screening while providing other clinical and financial analytics of value to the office. The Phase-IIB goal is to develop and test an innovative ""screening system"" not just a new test. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Autism is prevalent (1 in 50 children) and impairing but early intervention has been shown to improve outcomes prompting recommendations for screening at both two year and 18 month health check-ups. In Phase I, a standard screening procedure was adapted so that doctors could efficiently identify autistic children at two years of age but the screen did not prove accurate at 18 months. Phase II data showed that a novel method combining supplemental information and a new computerized scoring pathway promised accurate detection at the critical 18 month age. This Phase 2B proposal is aimed at replicating this unique approach to early autism identification in a community sample, comparing it with alternatives plus developing innovative strategies to assure that all children are screened by automating reminders and completion confirmation and by supporting continuous quality improvement in office implementation using automated reporting analytics.",Improving Accuracy and Accessibility of Early Autism Screening,9070770,R44MH085399,"['Academy', 'Accreditation', 'Address', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Award', 'Certification', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child health care', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Networks', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Incentives', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Maintenance', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Participation', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Reminder Systems', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Visit', 'autistic children', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'computerized', 'disparity reduction', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'screening', 'tool']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2016,796080,-0.013446598105701228
"SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions}: According to the 2010 US census (http://www.census.gov/prod/2011 pubs/acsbr1 0-12. pdf) 2.8 million school-aged children (aged 5 to 17) suffer from some form of mental and/or physical disability. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) guarantees such children equal access to education. However, children aged 1 to 5, while even more in need of early rehabilitation therapy and social interaction, do not receive the same attention. This proposal describes a plan for developing a new paradigm for pediatric rehabilitation. The paradigm involves robots that interact socially with special needs children, within a closed feedback control loop. Its components include new methods for modeling and representation of children motion, visual activity recognition, machine learning and behavior adaptation, and general-sum game-theoretic analysis of human-robot interaction. The research groups in the two collaborating institutions, University of Delaware (UD) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), have produced preliminary results and evidence which suggest that the envisioned technical innovations in the domains mentioned above are feasible, and that physical implementation is possible.  There are three intertwined research thrusts in the proposed activity, that address specific long-standing challenges in each area: 1. pediatric rehabilitation: develop a robot-assisted, pediatric rehabilitation environment which combines motor training with social interaction; 2. computer vision and perception: develop interpretable perception and machine learning algorithms for adaptive activity recognition; 3. robot control: develop the control and coordination algorithms to enable directed and purposeful human-robot interaction. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Each year, 10 000 infants in the U.S. develop cerebral palsy and 4 000 infants have birth defects of the spine and the brain. The motor delays for these infants have lifelong consequences. This gap in mobility is a significant secondary impairment. We propose a new portable motor rehabilitation system with social robotic interfaces that maximizes rehabilitation dosage. The project will provide insights into motor development in special needs children suggesting a new early intervention paradigm for children with motor disabilities.",SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation,9067563,R01HD087133,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Censuses', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Dancing', 'Data', 'Delaware', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Feedback', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Perception', 'Physical activity', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Visual', 'Visual Motion', 'Weight', 'aged', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cognitive disability', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'learned behavior', 'meetings', 'neuromuscular', 'peer', 'personalized medicine', 'robot assistance', 'skeletal', 'social']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2015,503237,0.010023929818449467
"PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH NEW-ONSET TICS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorders are often debilitating and are increasing in prevalence. Tourette Syndrome/Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD), we propose, has a course that lends itself especially well to discovering optimal strategies for early diagnosis and prevention of developmental disorders. Common clinical practice and epidemiological data suggest that a large fraction (10-25%) of all children manifest motor and/or vocal tics at some age. Yet only 1-3% of all children have tics for the full year required for diagnosis of TS/CTD. The objective of the proposed research is to understand the structural and functional neuroimaging features of children with new-onset tics (""New Tics""), as the neurobiology of this population has not been investigated. Studying children with New Tics should provide the most leverage in understanding why tics remit in some children but not others. This proposal compares neuroimaging features of New Tics to TS/CTD and to controls, implements machine-learning tools to predict whether children with New Tics will remit or develop TS/CTD, and utilizes longitudinal scans to identify within-subject changes that occur as tics remit or persist.  The proposed study will apply resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs fcMRI) and structural MRI methods to investigate children with New Tics. Neuroimaging will be conducted on children with current, new- onset tics, and comparisons will be made to existing MRI data from children with diagnosed TS/CTD and controls. Follow-up evaluation (1 year after tic onset) of New Tics will allow us to identify which children's tics remitted completely and whic were actually in the earliest stages of TS/CTD, thus sorting this group into Remitted Tics and Converted TS/CTD subgroups. Based on the epidemiological data, we expect most of New Tics subjects to fall in the Remitted Tics subgroup. Longitudinal scans of the New Tics children will enable us to assess within-subject changes that occur with remittance or persistence of tics. This study will also apply machine learning tools, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVMs), to characterize features that distinguish Remitted Tics and Existing TS/CTD groups. Those features will then be used to predict whether tics in the New Tics group will remit (Remitted Tics) or persist (Converted TS/CTD) on an individual patient basis. Thus, we will be poised to identify differences, and potentially early predictors, of remittance and TS/CTD.  This study will provide innovative, important data on a common clinical presentation: the child with New Tics. Completing our aims successfully will allow individual prediction of remission or progression, or at least will allow a New Tics sample to be enriched for high risk of developing TS/CTD, which would make prevention studies for TS/CTD feasible. We will also gain insight into the neurobiology of New Tics. Finally, this study is an essential first step towards a definitive longitudinal study that can improve diagnostic accuracy and settle questions of cause and effect. With successful completion of our aims, similar methods can be applied to other childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorders, setting the stage for early treatment or prevention of chronicity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Roughly 1 out of 5 school age children will develop tics, i.e. repetitive, purposeless movements or noises. However, only about 3% of all children have a chronic tic disorder, such as Tourette syndrome (TS), so tics are transient (lasting less than 1 year) in most children with tics. Tics can cause significant morbidity and adversely affect quality of life. It is of great clinical and scientific interest to be able to predict which child with newonset of tics will go on to have morbidity from chronic tics, and understanding of the neurobiology of transient tics has an excellent chance of improving our ability to manage these patients and perhaps even prevent development of TS. More generally, this approach may give insights into how to approach other neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism.                ",PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH NEW-ONSET TICS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA,8870047,R21NS091635,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Relative (related person)', 'Remittance', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'School-Age Population', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Tic disorder', 'Transient Tics', 'Vocal Tics', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'unpublished works']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,228750,0.05039296995176057
"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes. The goal is to identify imaging measures which identify preterm infants at risk for particular deficits, thereby allowing institution of timely therapies specific to each chid's needs and enabling larger research trials evaluating interventions designed to improve developmental outcomes in this vulnerable group.",PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,8934210,K02NS089852,"['2 year old', '5 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early identification', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'motor deficit', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'research study', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2015,191131,-0.005921979062167247
"National Exposure Assessment Laboratory at Emory ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The vision for the U2C National Exposure Assessment Laboratory at Emory (NEALE) is to provide the children's health research community with access to state-of-the-art analysis of environmental factors related to health and disease. In addition to providing data, the NEALE will provide context for the results including detailed methodology, sample processing, data analysis flow, rigorous quality control/assurance and assistance with interpretation. Building upon infrastructure established as part of the exposome-based NIEHS P30, the Emory team is ideally suited to pursue the type of research described in the U2C RFA.

"In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In utero exposure to antidepressants was recently associated with increased risk for autism in an analysis of a large health care claims database. This result is consistent with twin studies indicating greater concordance for autism among dizygotic twins compared to non-twin siblings, likely pointing to shared in utero risk. The need to clarify the risk posed by antidepressants is acute, as it has profound public health implications. Confirmation of the finding would support a rare modifiable risk factor for autism, and help to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder. Conversely, if the finding is a false positive, it might lead to undertreatment of major depression among pregnant women, with consequent risks to both mother and fetus. The proposed study will utilize electronic medical record (EMR) data from more than 4 million individuals in a large New England health system. The investigators and their colleagues have previously applied an EMR query toolkit, which they helped to develop, to characterize treatment outcomes and conduct pharmacovigilance and genetic studies in psychiatry and beyond. Notably, this health care system includes large obstetrics, psychiatry, and pediatric practices, and is a referral center for child neuropsychiatri disorders. Children ages 4-12 with a diagnosis of autism who were delivered in this system will be identified using validated natural language processing tools. A matched (2:1) cohort of children with a diagnosis of ADHD will be identified, along with a matched (5:1) control cohort of children receiving routine pediatric care. The EMR will then be used to match each child with their mother, allowing characterization of maternal socio-demographic status, medical and psychiatric illness, and medication treatment during pregnancy. To further improve precision, Massachusetts state birth certificate data will be queried. This data includes details of perinatal care, exposures, and complications, as well as paternal age and socio-demographic status. Regression models will be applied to the resulting data set, encompassing more than 700 children with autism, 1400 children with ADHD, and 3500 healthy control children. In addition to examining the association between antidepressant exposure and autism liability, with appropriate control for confounding, this data set will allow investigation of other putative in utero and perinatal risk factors, creating a key resource for future studies. This project will innovate in two key respects. First, it will address the problem of confounding by indication present in prior antidepressant pharmacovigilance studies, using tools developed by the investigators for characterizing depression severity/comorbidity and course to better match cases and controls. Second, it will establish the utility of an EMR-based approach for studying pregnancy exposures and outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will estimate the amount of autism risk, if any, associated with exposure to antidepressants and other medicines before birth. This information will allow mothers to make more informed decisions weighing the risks and benefits of treatment for depression and related illnesses during pregnancy. It may also contribute to a better understanding of the causes of autism itself.",In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism,8829343,R01MH100286,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Dizygotic Twins', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic study', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Massachusetts', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Paternal Age', 'Perinatal', 'Perinatal Care', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'Twin Studies', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'depressive symptoms', 'improved', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maternal depression', 'modifiable risk', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'prenatal risk factor', 'randomized trial', 'sample collection', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2015,348000,0.015187614030240371
"Neurobehavioral Contributors to Math Failure: A Reward-Based Learning Framework DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this set of applications, we propose to initiate a new Learning Disabilities Research Hub focusing initially on high risk for mathematics failure. We proposed to situate this new Hub within an existing strong infrastructure for pediatric neurobehavioral and imaging research, the Pediatric Neurocognition, Imaging, and Genetics (PING) data resource. PING infrastructure provides many important advantages for building a new cross disciplinary and multiple-investigator program, as it has already brought together a strong team of behavioral, clinical, imaging, computational, and genetics investigators as a closely integrated team, and most importantly has attracted a very talented group of young investigators and graduate students focused on the problems addressed in the proposed research. A unifying theme of the studies that our team has proposed is the notion that math failure, and perhaps academic failure more broadly, emerges gradually through interactions of putative early conceptual weaknesses, attributable in some cases to poor functioning and anomalous neural architecture in specific neural systems, with increasing reward-based biases that contribute, additively or non-additively, to suppression of the normal learning trajectory. Consistent with this theme we refer to our proposed research hub as the Roles of Emotion and Choice (REaCh) in Learning Disabilities Research Hub (LDRH). The proposed REaCh Hub has 3 components: a new research project to investigate key questions about learning and the neural architecture during early development in children at high risk for math failure, and two cores. The Administrative Core proposal describes the management plan for the new Hub and the PING infrastructure that will be adapted for the new studies; and focuses on a nested mentoring plan for ensuring close interaction between trainees at different levels with mid-level and senior investigators within focused workgroups. The assets of the Core for within-Hub and extra-Hub data sharing are also described. A Developmental Infrastructure Core proposal describes the administration of a small grant program to support novel work within the Hub by junior investigators, trainees, and investigators from disciplines outside of the original REaCh LDRH group. A new Learning Disabilities Research Hub would be created to bring scientists with different kinds of expertise together to study learning disabilities, focusing initially on risk for math failure in young children. The scientists would study learning and brain development in children and focus specifically on the importance of the children's emotional responses to mathematical information.",Neurobehavioral Contributors to Math Failure: A Reward-Based Learning Framework,8885862,R24HD075489,"['12 year old', 'Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Animals', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pediatric Research', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'computational neuroscience', 'data sharing', 'elementary school', 'emotional factor', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'graduate student', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical model', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'skills']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2015,547017,0.011063132244097263
"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows Abstract: Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking. Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (PI) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals. By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 proposal builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health. In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study. Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities. Narrative: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking. Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This proposal will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",8992934,R00ES022986,"['13 year old', '4 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Burden', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Hair', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Nail plate', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'abstracting', 'analytical tool', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deciduous tooth', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'forest', 'innovation', 'lead exposure', 'longitudinal design', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'public health priorities', 'skills', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R00,2015,248999,0.08668249073120039

"A preschool biomarker for literacy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as one in ten children have the poor reading and spelling skills that comprise developmental dyslexia. It is widely accepted that there is a neurological basis; however, the nature of that basis is hotly debated. Nevertheless, one consistent view is that poor phonological processing-the ability to access and manipulate the sound units of language-is involved in dyslexia. Indeed, a majority of children with reading deficits exhibit difficulties on an array of phonological processing tasks. A growing body of research has discovered that speech-sound transcription, as measured by electrophysiology, shows striking relationships with phonological processing skills and reading ability in school-age children. As such, we have developed a suite of subcortical and cortical physiological tests that probe some of the core deficits that researchers have postulated as the root elements of poor phonological processing. We will target the subcortical processing of time-varying signals and stimulus regularities, and cortical hemispheric specialization to both fast and slow signals. In a longitudinal cohort of four- to eight-year-olds, we will model the normal neurological speech transcription process, quantify its development, and examine its relationship with the development of literacy-related skills. Our intention is that by leveraging these electrophysiological probes to a pre-reading age group, a biomarker, in preschoolers, may be found that predicts a child's eventual reading skill as he/she progresses through the primary grades. If such a biomarker is found, it would pave the way for earlier and more effectively targeted intervention. As objective neurophysiological measures of literacy become available, a logical step is to apply what has been learned about subcortical and cortical physiology and their relationships with reading to young pre- readers. The outcome of the proposed work will be a deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings of literacy, particularly in pre-literate children, and a means to exploit objective biological responses as biomarkers of future literacy. This outcome will positively impact our understanding of the core deficits leading to poor reading, and has the potential to spur early intervention programs to head off the potential onset of developmental dyslexia.",A preschool biomarker for literacy,8826794,R01HD069414,"['4 year old', '8 year old', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Brainstem Responses', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Stem', 'Cerebral Dominance', 'Child', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental reading disorder', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Employee Strikes', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Financial cost', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Schools', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reading Disorder', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcription Process', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'age group', 'auditory pathway', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive skill', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'corticofugal fiber', 'experience', 'falls', 'intervention program', 'literacy', 'literate', 'neurophysiology', 'peer', 'phonology', 'reading ability', 'reading difficulties', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'sound', 'spelling', 'stimulus processing']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,356936,0.031061766260540125
"Microfluidics-Enabled High-Throughput Studies on Early Embryonic Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prenatal alcohol exposure causes a range of developmental disorders that are commonly referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). The most severe case of FASDs is known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and is characterized by growth deficiencies, craniofacial malformations, and both structural and functional central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. The combination of technological limitations that decrease experimental throughput and the inherent stochasticity of biological processes eliminate the ability to gain a quantitative understanding about the onset and progression of ethanol-related developmental disorders. As a result there is not much known mechanistically about how ethanol exposure manifests as FASDs. Here, we aim to develop a microfluidic-based system that enables high-throughput and high-content studies to elucidate the effects of ethanol exposure on embryogenesis. The model organism Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila) has been shown to be a model of FASDs, because Drosophila exhibits similar phenotypical defects as humans when embryos are raised on ethanol solutions. It has yet to be seen how ethanol exposure affects developmental processes that occur during embryogenesis that lead to the wide ranging symptoms of FASDs. The technological gap that precedes this is a method that can robustly expose developing fly embryos to ethanol while also allowing high-throughput live imaging and data acquisition. The objective of this project is to develop enabling technologies for whole embryo imaging to uncover the mechanisms through which embryonic ethanol exposure affects morphogenesis and developmental patterning that ultimately lead to FASDs. In order to address the technological gap we are developing a microfluidic system that can culture and expose live Drosophila embryos to ethanol in a highly-parallelized manner. This system will also enable live imaging of embryogenesis, so that we can better understand how ethanol exposure affects morphogenesis. Furthermore, the microfluidic system will be integrated with tissue clearing techniques that will enable whole embryo imaging and thus allow us to visualize whole embryo gene expression patterns. In this study, we will study mutants of key enzymes to better elucidate their roles in FASD. Using this device, I aim to better our understanding about the physical and gene expression changes involved with FASDs. Microfluidic systems will be integrated with computer automation programs that will increase data acquisition rates. Data analysis will be streamlined through the development of computer vision algorithms that will help identify phenotypical changes associated with ethanol exposure that are non-obvious and likely to be missed by manual annotation. This project will not only enlarge the repertoire of tools available for developmental biology in general, but also will have significant impact on ethanol teratology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop a high-throughput, microfluidics-based system for studying the physical and genetic origins of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). The results of this project will greatly increase our understanding of how prenatal ethanol exposure affects early embryogenesis and elucidate the mechanism through which ethanol exposure results in a wide range of developmental defects. Insights gained from this project will lead to novel treatments to help reduce ethanol teratogenicity and prevent the onset of FASDs.             ",Microfluidics-Enabled High-Throughput Studies on Early Embryonic Development,8912850,F31AA023160,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Body Size', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Congenital neurologic anomalies', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Cues', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Ethanol', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Morphogenesis', 'Nerve', 'Neuraxis', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Solutions', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teratogens', 'Teratology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'brain size', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'developmental genetics', 'fly', 'functional disability', 'gastrulation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'miniaturize', 'mutant', 'nervous system development', 'neuroblast', 'novel', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'synaptogenesis', 'tool']",NIAAA,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2015,37977,-0.016517917795779803
"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,8929222,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'routine care', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,645802,0.013361995923901504
"Improving Accuracy and Accessibility of Early Autism Screening DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism is prevalent (1 in 50 children) and impairing but early intervention has been shown to improve outcomes prompting recommendations for screening at both two year and 18 month health check-ups. Detection of autism early is crucial but accurate screening tools have been elusive. In Phase II, a practical method of improving accuracy of M-CHAT, the most widely used autism screen, was created by adapting the validated and recommended follow up interview, M-CHAT F/Ui (F/U), for efficient use during the visit. In the case of a positive screen, the primary care provider (PCP) can use CHADIS, a web-based questionnaire delivery, decision support and post-visit engagement system, to conduct F/U rather than requiring a visit with another professional. Phase II data showed F/U results by a PCP were equivalent to the autism center. Phase-II data on the M-CHAT plus F/U via CHADIS replicated findings of the F/U authors in showing both excellent positive predictive value (PPV) 0.96 for children >20 months (thus effective for 24 month olds) and also low PPV 0.54 for <20 months. Promisingly, Phase II exploratory analyses using a decision tree including supplementary data from a routinely used standard language screen (ASQ communication scale) and an item from a language measure (MCDI) plus the standard autism screen (M-CHAT plus F/U) reached PPV of 0.95 in the <20 month group. This screen completion could be done efficiently online by parents. Phase IIB plans a replication of this screening procedure which promises to be accurate for 18 month olds and comparison to alternatives using the community network of >400 Maryland doctors where >22,000 autism screens have been done using the CHADIS system. A more accurate screening test is of less value if it is not universally used. In Phase II, an approach was developed that reduces disparities in access to screening using a ""talking"" tablet kiosk that was preferred by parents to alternatives, but further workflow issues will be addressed in Phase IIB. To improve screen completion, we will program an automated reminder/completion confirmation text/email system in CHADIS with coupons as incentives for parents. In Phase II, CHADIS was adapted to capture both patient input and doctor decision-making and Maintenance of Certification (MOC) accreditation was awarded by the American Board of Pediatrics for this program and earned by 140 pediatricians. This monthly doctor quality improvement program will be extended to a daily continuous quality improvement process for the whole office team to further assure patient participation in screening while providing other clinical and financial analytics of value to the office. The Phase-IIB goal is to develop and test an innovative ""screening system"" not just a new test. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Autism is prevalent (1 in 50 children) and impairing but early intervention has been shown to improve outcomes prompting recommendations for screening at both two year and 18 month health check-ups. In Phase I, a standard screening procedure was adapted so that doctors could efficiently identify autistic children at two years of age but the screen did not prove accurate at 18 months. Phase II data showed that a novel method combining supplemental information and a new computerized scoring pathway promised accurate detection at the critical 18 month age. This Phase 2B proposal is aimed at replicating this unique approach to early autism identification in a community sample, comparing it with alternatives plus developing innovative strategies to assure that all children are screened by automating reminders and completion confirmation and by supporting continuous quality improvement in office implementation using automated reporting analytics.",Improving Accuracy and Accessibility of Early Autism Screening,8894598,R44MH085399,"['Academy', 'Accreditation', 'Address', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Award', 'Certification', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child health care', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Networks', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Incentives', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Maintenance', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Participation', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Reminder Systems', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Visit', 'autistic children', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'computerized', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'screening', 'tool']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2015,796060,-0.013446598105701228
"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes. The goal is to identify imaging measures which identify preterm infants at risk for particular deficits, thereby allowing institution of timely therapies specific to each chid's needs and enabling larger research trials evaluating interventions designed to improve developmental outcomes in this vulnerable group.                ",PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,8804757,K02NS089852,"['2 year old', '5 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early identification', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'motor deficit', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'skills', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2014,191131,-0.005921979062167247
"In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In utero exposure to antidepressants was recently associated with increased risk for autism in an analysis of a large health care claims database. This result is consistent with twin studies indicating greater concordance for autism among dizygotic twins compared to non-twin siblings, likely pointing to shared in utero risk. The need to clarify the risk posed by antidepressants is acute, as it has profound public health implications. Confirmation of the finding would support a rare modifiable risk factor for autism, and help to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder. Conversely, if the finding is a false positive, it might lead to undertreatment of major depression among pregnant women, with consequent risks to both mother and fetus. The proposed study will utilize electronic medical record (EMR) data from more than 4 million individuals in a large New England health system. The investigators and their colleagues have previously applied an EMR query toolkit, which they helped to develop, to characterize treatment outcomes and conduct pharmacovigilance and genetic studies in psychiatry and beyond. Notably, this health care system includes large obstetrics, psychiatry, and pediatric practices, and is a referral center for child neuropsychiatri disorders. Children ages 4-12 with a diagnosis of autism who were delivered in this system will be identified using validated natural language processing tools. A matched (2:1) cohort of children with a diagnosis of ADHD will be identified, along with a matched (5:1) control cohort of children receiving routine pediatric care. The EMR will then be used to match each child with their mother, allowing characterization of maternal socio-demographic status, medical and psychiatric illness, and medication treatment during pregnancy. To further improve precision, Massachusetts state birth certificate data will be queried. This data includes details of perinatal care, exposures, and complications, as well as paternal age and socio-demographic status. Regression models will be applied to the resulting data set, encompassing more than 700 children with autism, 1400 children with ADHD, and 3500 healthy control children. In addition to examining the association between antidepressant exposure and autism liability, with appropriate control for confounding, this data set will allow investigation of other putative in utero and perinatal risk factors, creating a key resource for future studies. This project will innovate in two key respects. First, it will address the problem of confounding by indication present in prior antidepressant pharmacovigilance studies, using tools developed by the investigators for characterizing depression severity/comorbidity and course to better match cases and controls. Second, it will establish the utility of an EMR-based approach for studying pregnancy exposures and outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will estimate the amount of autism risk, if any, associated with exposure to antidepressants and other medicines before birth. This information will allow mothers to make more informed decisions weighing the risks and benefits of treatment for depression and related illnesses during pregnancy. It may also contribute to a better understanding of the causes of autism itself.            ",In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism,8663964,R01MH100286,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Dizygotic Twins', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Massachusetts', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Paternal Age', 'Perinatal', 'Perinatal Care', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'Twin Studies', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'depressive symptoms', 'improved', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maternal depression', 'modifiable risk', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'prenatal risk factor', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'sample collection', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2014,348000,0.015187614030240371
"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking.  Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (principal investigator) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting-edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals.  By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 application builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health.  In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study.  Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities.         Public Health Relevance: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking.  Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This application will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.

"Neurobehavioral Contributors to Math Failure: A Reward-Based Learning Framework DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this set of applications, we propose to initiate a new Learning Disabilities Research Hub focusing initially on high risk for mathematics failure. We proposed to situate this new Hub within an existing strong infrastructure for pediatric neurobehavioral and imaging research, the Pediatric Neurocognition, Imaging, and Genetics (PING) data resource. PING infrastructure provides many important advantages for building a new cross disciplinary and multiple-investigator program, as it has already brought together a strong team of behavioral, clinical, imaging, computational, and genetics investigators as a closely integrated team, and most importantly has attracted a very talented group of young investigators and graduate students focused on the problems addressed in the proposed research. A unifying theme of the studies that our team has proposed is the notion that math failure, and perhaps academic failure more broadly, emerges gradually through interactions of putative early conceptual weaknesses, attributable in some cases to poor functioning and anomalous neural architecture in specific neural systems, with increasing reward-based biases that contribute, additively or non-additively, to suppression of the normal learning trajectory. Consistent with this theme we refer to our proposed research hub as the Roles of Emotion and Choice (REaCh) in Learning Disabilities Research Hub (LDRH). The proposed REaCh Hub has 3 components: a new research project to investigate key questions about learning and the neural architecture during early development in children at high risk for math failure, and two cores. The Administrative Core proposal describes the management plan for the new Hub and the PING infrastructure that will be adapted for the new studies; and focuses on a nested mentoring plan for ensuring close interaction between trainees at different levels with mid-level and senior investigators within focused workgroups. The assets of the Core for within-Hub and extra-Hub data sharing are also described. A Developmental Infrastructure Core proposal describes the administration of a small grant program to support novel work within the Hub by junior investigators, trainees, and investigators from disciplines outside of the original REaCh LDRH group. A new Learning Disabilities Research Hub would be created to bring scientists with different kinds of expertise together to study learning disabilities, focusing initially on risk for math failure in young children. The scientists would study learning and brain development in children and focus specifically on the importance of the children's emotional responses to mathematical information.",Neurobehavioral Contributors to Math Failure: A Reward-Based Learning Framework,8705558,R24HD075489,"['12 year old', 'Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Animals', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pediatric Research', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'computational neuroscience', 'data sharing', 'elementary school', 'emotional factor', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'graduate student', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical model', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'skills']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2014,538747,0.011063132244097263

"A preschool biomarker for literacy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as one in ten children have the poor reading and spelling skills that comprise developmental dyslexia. It is widely accepted that there is a neurological basis; however, the nature of that basis is hotly debated. Nevertheless, one consistent view is that poor phonological processing-the ability to access and manipulate the sound units of language-is involved in dyslexia. Indeed, a majority of children with reading deficits exhibit difficulties on an array of phonological processing tasks. A growing body of research has discovered that speech-sound transcription, as measured by electrophysiology, shows striking relationships with phonological processing skills and reading ability in school-age children. As such, we have developed a suite of subcortical and cortical physiological tests that probe some of the core deficits that researchers have postulated as the root elements of poor phonological processing. We will target the subcortical processing of time-varying signals and stimulus regularities, and cortical hemispheric specialization to both fast and slow signals. In a longitudinal cohort of four- to eight-year-olds, we will model the normal neurological speech transcription process, quantify its development, and examine its relationship with the development of literacy-related skills. Our intention is that by leveraging these electrophysiological probes to a pre-reading age group, a biomarker, in preschoolers, may be found that predicts a child's eventual reading skill as he/she progresses through the primary grades. If such a biomarker is found, it would pave the way for earlier and more effectively targeted intervention.          As objective neurophysiological measures of literacy become available, a logical step is to apply what has been learned about subcortical and cortical physiology and their relationships with reading to young pre- readers. The outcome of the proposed work will be a deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings of literacy, particularly in pre-literate children, and a means to exploit objective biological responses as biomarkers of future literacy. This outcome will positively impact our understanding of the core deficits leading to poor reading, and has the potential to spur early intervention programs to head off the potential onset of developmental dyslexia.

"Microfluidics-Enabled High-Throughput Studies on Early Embryonic Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prenatal alcohol exposure causes a range of developmental disorders that are commonly referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). The most severe case of FASDs is known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and is characterized by growth deficiencies, craniofacial malformations, and both structural and functional central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. The combination of technological limitations that decrease experimental throughput and the inherent stochasticity of biological processes eliminate the ability to gain a quantitative understanding about the onset and progression of ethanol-related developmental disorders. As a result there is not much known mechanistically about how ethanol exposure manifests as FASDs. Here, we aim to develop a microfluidic-based system that enables high-throughput and high-content studies to elucidate the effects of ethanol exposure on embryogenesis. The model organism Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila) has been shown to be a model of FASDs, because Drosophila exhibits similar phenotypical defects as humans when embryos are raised on ethanol solutions. It has yet to be seen how ethanol exposure affects developmental processes that occur during embryogenesis that lead to the wide ranging symptoms of FASDs. The technological gap that precedes this is a method that can robustly expose developing fly embryos to ethanol while also allowing high-throughput live imaging and data acquisition. The objective of this project is to develop enabling technologies for whole embryo imaging to uncover the mechanisms through which embryonic ethanol exposure affects morphogenesis and developmental patterning that ultimately lead to FASDs. In order to address the technological gap we are developing a microfluidic system that can culture and expose live Drosophila embryos to ethanol in a highly-parallelized manner. This system will also enable live imaging of embryogenesis, so that we can better understand how ethanol exposure affects morphogenesis. Furthermore, the microfluidic system will be integrated with tissue clearing techniques that will enable whole embryo imaging and thus allow us to visualize whole embryo gene expression patterns. In this study, we will study mutants of key enzymes to better elucidate their roles in FASD. Using this device, I aim to better our understanding about the physical and gene expression changes involved with FASDs. Microfluidic systems will be integrated with computer automation programs that will increase data acquisition rates. Data analysis will be streamlined through the development of computer vision algorithms that will help identify phenotypical changes associated with ethanol exposure that are non-obvious and likely to be missed by manual annotation. This project will not only enlarge the repertoire of tools available for developmental biology in general, but also will have significant impact on ethanol teratology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop a high-throughput, microfluidics-based system for studying the physical and genetic origins of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). The results of this project will greatly increase our understanding of how prenatal ethanol exposure affects early embryogenesis and elucidate the mechanism through which ethanol exposure results in a wide range of developmental defects. Insights gained from this project will lead to novel treatments to help reduce ethanol teratogenicity and prevent the onset of FASDs.             ",Microfluidics-Enabled High-Throughput Studies on Early Embryonic Development,8721107,F31AA023160,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Body Size', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Congenital neurologic anomalies', 'Cues', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Ethanol', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Morphogenesis', 'Nerve', 'Neuraxis', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Solutions', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teratogens', 'Teratology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'brain size', 'craniofacial', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'developmental genetics', 'fly', 'functional disability', 'gastrulation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malformation', 'miniaturize', 'mutant', 'nervous system development', 'neuroblast', 'novel', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'synaptogenesis', 'tool']",NIAAA,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2014,42676,-0.016517917795779803
"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.            ",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,8815576,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,675943,0.013361995923901504
"Improving Accuracy and Accessibility of Early Autism Screening     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism is prevalent (1 in 50 children) and impairing but early intervention has been shown to improve outcomes prompting recommendations for screening at both two year and 18 month health check-ups. Detection of autism early is crucial but accurate screening tools have been elusive. In Phase II, a practical method of improving accuracy of M-CHAT, the most widely used autism screen, was created by adapting the validated and recommended follow up interview, M-CHAT F/Ui (F/U), for efficient use during the visit. In the case of a positive screen, the primary care provider (PCP) can use CHADIS, a web-based questionnaire delivery, decision support and post-visit engagement system, to conduct F/U rather than requiring a visit with another professional. Phase II data showed F/U results by a PCP were equivalent to the autism center. Phase-II data on the M-CHAT plus F/U via CHADIS replicated findings of the F/U authors in showing both excellent positive predictive value (PPV) 0.96 for children >20 months (thus effective for 24 month olds) and also low PPV 0.54 for <20 months. Promisingly, Phase II exploratory analyses using a decision tree including supplementary data from a routinely used standard language screen (ASQ communication scale) and an item from a language measure (MCDI) plus the standard autism screen (M-CHAT plus F/U) reached PPV of 0.95 in the <20 month group. This screen completion could be done efficiently online by parents. Phase IIB plans a replication of this screening procedure which promises to be accurate for 18 month olds and comparison to alternatives using the community network of >400 Maryland doctors where >22,000 autism screens have been done using the CHADIS system. A more accurate screening test is of less value if it is not universally used. In Phase II, an approach was developed that reduces disparities in access to screening using a ""talking"" tablet kiosk that was preferred by parents to alternatives, but further workflow issues will be addressed in Phase IIB. To improve screen completion, we will program an automated reminder/completion confirmation text/email system in CHADIS with coupons as incentives for parents. In Phase II, CHADIS was adapted to capture both patient input and doctor decision-making and Maintenance of Certification (MOC) accreditation was awarded by the American Board of Pediatrics for this program and earned by 140 pediatricians. This monthly doctor quality improvement program will be extended to a daily continuous quality improvement process for the whole office team to further assure patient participation in screening while providing other clinical and financial analytics of value to the office. The Phase-IIB goal is to develop and test an innovative ""screening system"" not just a new test.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Autism is prevalent (1 in 50 children) and impairing but early intervention has been shown to improve outcomes prompting recommendations for screening at both two year and 18 month health check-ups. In Phase I, a standard screening procedure was adapted so that doctors could efficiently identify autistic children at two years of age but the screen did not prove accurate at 18 months. Phase II data showed that a novel method combining supplemental information and a new computerized scoring pathway promised accurate detection at the critical 18 month age. This Phase 2B proposal is aimed at replicating this unique approach to early autism identification in a community sample, comparing it with alternatives plus developing innovative strategies to assure that all children are screened by automating reminders and completion confirmation and by supporting continuous quality improvement in office implementation using automated reporting analytics.            ",Improving Accuracy and Accessibility of Early Autism Screening,8714587,R44MH085399,"['Academy', 'Accreditation', 'Address', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Award', 'Certification', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child health care', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Networks', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Incentives', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Maintenance', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Participation', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Reminder Systems', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Visit', 'autistic children', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'computerized', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2014,796039,-0.013446598105701228
"Innovative Research Methods to Study Children with Multiple Chronic Conditions     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Children with multiple chronic conditions - two or more chronic conditions that affect the person at the same time - represent an important group of individuals who receive inadequate quality of healthcare and experience suboptimal health outcomes. Clinicians, researchers, administrators, and policy experts are currently uninformed on how to best improve care for these children. This is, in part, because of two methodological challenges that are particularly problematic when studying children with multiple chronic conditions: 1) the ability to comprehensively measure and group comorbid conditions in children and 2) the ability to assess pediatric comorbidity burden on a population level. This proposal will validate and test an innovative set of methods that will help overcome these challenges. Although the set of methods, collectively, is new to the study of children with multiple chronic conditions, we have found components of the set to be feasible and valuable in our prior work. The specific aims of this proposal are 1) to adapt for children a publicly available diagnosis classification scheme (i.e., AHRQ's Chronic Condition Indicator and Clinical Classification System) to name and count coexisting chronic conditions in children; 2) to determine the prevalence and the healthcare cost and utilization (total and excessive) of each type of child with multiple chronic conditions; 3) to complete an evidenced-based prioritization process, based on the Pareto Principle, to describe the relative contribution of combinations of chronic conditions to prevalence and to healthcare cost and utilization; and 4) to employ an innovative, machine learning method (i.e., regression tree boosting) to systematically assess every interaction of coexisting chronic conditions in children to predict healthcare cost and utilization The proposed work will be conducted in existing datasets that contain 10.7 million children with comprehensive Medicaid claims data (i.e., community, emergency, home, inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy care, etc.) from 28 states as well as 3.7 million hospitalized children from the all-payer, nationally-representative Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database developed by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Use of the methods and results generated from this proposal will help clinics, hospitals, communities, states, health systems, payers, federal agencies, and others identify children with multiple chronic conditions, describe their coexisting conditions, determine which of these children have the largest impact on the pediatric healthcare system, and quantify how much of their health care cost and utilization could be avoided with high quality of care. This information will help prioritize which subgroups of children with multiple chronic conditions to target for comparative effectiveness research, quality improvement initiatives, and health system redesign. This proposal is aligned with the mission of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to improve the quality of health care for all Americans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The research in this proposal is relevant to public health because it will rapidly advance our understanding of the U.S. population of children living with multiple chronic conditions. The research will help identify and describe the children living with multiple chronic conditions, as well as the health care cost and utilization experienced by them. The methods and findings from the research will help improve the health and wellbeing of these children.            ",Innovative Research Methods to Study Children with Multiple Chronic Conditions,8726574,R21HS023092,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2014,179808,0.037012349970541716
"Neurobehavioral Contributors to Math Failure: A Reward-Based Learning Framework DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this set of applications, we propose to initiate a new Learning Disabilities Research Hub focusing initially on high risk for mathematics failure. We proposed to situate this new Hub within an existing strong infrastructure for pediatric neurobehavioral and imaging research, the Pediatric Neurocognition, Imaging, and Genetics (PING) data resource. PING infrastructure provides many important advantages for building a new cross disciplinary and multiple-investigator program, as it has already brought together a strong team of behavioral, clinical, imaging, computational, and genetics investigators as a closely integrated team, and most importantly has attracted a very talented group of young investigators and graduate students focused on the problems addressed in the proposed research. A unifying theme of the studies that our team has proposed is the notion that math failure, and perhaps academic failure more broadly, emerges gradually through interactions of putative early conceptual weaknesses, attributable in some cases to poor functioning and anomalous neural architecture in specific neural systems, with increasing reward-based biases that contribute, additively or non-additively, to suppression of the normal learning trajectory. Consistent with this theme we refer to our proposed research hub as the Roles of Emotion and Choice (REaCh) in Learning Disabilities Research Hub (LDRH). The proposed REaCh Hub has 3 components: a new research project to investigate key questions about learning and the neural architecture during early development in children at high risk for math failure, and two cores. The Administrative Core proposal describes the management plan for the new Hub and the PING infrastructure that will be adapted for the new studies; and focuses on a nested mentoring plan for ensuring close interaction between trainees at different levels with mid-level and senior investigators within focused workgroups. The assets of the Core for within-Hub and extra-Hub data sharing are also described. A Developmental Infrastructure Core proposal describes the administration of a small grant program to support novel work within the Hub by junior investigators, trainees, and investigators from disciplines outside of the original REaCh LDRH group. A new Learning Disabilities Research Hub would be created to bring scientists with different kinds of expertise together to study learning disabilities, focusing initially on risk for math failure in young children. The scientists would study learning and brain development in children and focus specifically on the importance of the children's emotional responses to mathematical information.",Neurobehavioral Contributors to Math Failure: A Reward-Based Learning Framework,8554790,R24HD075489,"['12 year old', 'Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Animals', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pediatric Research', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'computational neuroscience', 'data sharing', 'elementary school', 'emotional factor', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'graduate student', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'mathematical model', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'skills']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2013,529465,0.011063132244097263
"In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In utero exposure to antidepressants was recently associated with increased risk for autism in an analysis of a large health care claims database. This result is consistent with twin studies indicating greater concordance for autism among dizygotic twins compared to non-twin siblings, likely pointing to shared in utero risk. The need to clarify the risk posed by antidepressants is acute, as it has profound public health implications. Confirmation of the finding would support a rare modifiable risk factor for autism, and help to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder. Conversely, if the finding is a false positive, it might lead to undertreatment of major depression among pregnant women, with consequent risks to both mother and fetus. The proposed study will utilize electronic medical record (EMR) data from more than 4 million individuals in a large New England health system. The investigators and their colleagues have previously applied an EMR query toolkit, which they helped to develop, to characterize treatment outcomes and conduct pharmacovigilance and genetic studies in psychiatry and beyond. Notably, this health care system includes large obstetrics, psychiatry, and pediatric practices, and is a referral center for child neuropsychiatri disorders. Children ages 4-12 with a diagnosis of autism who were delivered in this system will be identified using validated natural language processing tools. A matched (2:1) cohort of children with a diagnosis of ADHD will be identified, along with a matched (5:1) control cohort of children receiving routine pediatric care. The EMR will then be used to match each child with their mother, allowing characterization of maternal socio-demographic status, medical and psychiatric illness, and medication treatment during pregnancy. To further improve precision, Massachusetts state birth certificate data will be queried. This data includes details of perinatal care, exposures, and complications, as well as paternal age and socio-demographic status. Regression models will be applied to the resulting data set, encompassing more than 700 children with autism, 1400 children with ADHD, and 3500 healthy control children. In addition to examining the association between antidepressant exposure and autism liability, with appropriate control for confounding, this data set will allow investigation of other putative in utero and perinatal risk factors, creating a key resource for future studies. This project will innovate in two key respects. First, it will address the problem of confounding by indication present in prior antidepressant pharmacovigilance studies, using tools developed by the investigators for characterizing depression severity/comorbidity and course to better match cases and controls. Second, it will establish the utility of an EMR-based approach for studying pregnancy exposures and outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will estimate the amount of autism risk, if any, associated with exposure to antidepressants and other medicines before birth. This information will allow mothers to make more informed decisions weighing the risks and benefits of treatment for depression and related illnesses during pregnancy. It may also contribute to a better understanding of the causes of autism itself.            ",In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism,8483291,R01MH100286,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Dizygotic Twins', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Massachusetts', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Paternal Age', 'Perinatal', 'Perinatal Care', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'Twin Studies', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'depressive symptoms', 'improved', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maternal depression', 'modifiable risk', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'prenatal risk factor', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'sample collection', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2013,343560,0.015187614030240371
"A preschool biomarker for literacy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as one in ten children have the poor reading and spelling skills that comprise developmental dyslexia. It is widely accepted that there is a neurological basis; however, the nature of that basis is hotly debated. Nevertheless, one consistent view is that poor phonological processing-the ability to access and manipulate the sound units of language-is involved in dyslexia. Indeed, a majority of children with reading deficits exhibit difficulties on an array of phonological processing tasks. A growing body of research has discovered that speech-sound transcription, as measured by electrophysiology, shows striking relationships with phonological processing skills and reading ability in school-age children. As such, we have developed a suite of subcortical and cortical physiological tests that probe some of the core deficits that researchers have postulated as the root elements of poor phonological processing. We will target the subcortical processing of time-varying signals and stimulus regularities, and cortical hemispheric specialization to both fast and slow signals. In a longitudinal cohort of four- to eight-year-olds, we will model the normal neurological speech transcription process, quantify its development, and examine its relationship with the development of literacy-related skills. Our intention is that by leveraging these electrophysiological probes to a pre-reading age group, a biomarker, in preschoolers, may be found that predicts a child's eventual reading skill as he/she progresses through the primary grades. If such a biomarker is found, it would pave the way for earlier and more effectively targeted intervention.          As objective neurophysiological measures of literacy become available, a logical step is to apply what has been learned about subcortical and cortical physiology and their relationships with reading to young pre- readers. The outcome of the proposed work will be a deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings of literacy, particularly in pre-literate children, and a means to exploit objective biological responses as biomarkers of future literacy. This outcome will positively impact our understanding of the core deficits leading to poor reading, and has the potential to spur early intervention programs to head off the potential onset of developmental dyslexia.

"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking.  Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (principal investigator) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting-edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals.  By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 application builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health.  In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study.  Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities.         Public Health Relevance: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking.  Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This application will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.                ","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",8566379,K99ES022986,"['13 year old', '4 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Burden', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Hair', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Nail plate', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'analytical tool', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deciduous tooth', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'forest', 'innovation', 'lead exposure', 'longitudinal design', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2013,102242,0.08551386094185025

"Neurobehavioral Contributors to Math Failure: A Reward-Based Learning Framework     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this set of applications, we propose to initiate a new Learning Disabilities Research Hub focusing initially on high risk for mathematics failure. We proposed to situate this new Hub within an existing strong infrastructure for pediatric neurobehavioral and imaging research, the Pediatric Neurocognition, Imaging, and Genetics (PING) data resource. PING infrastructure provides many important advantages for building a new cross disciplinary and multiple-investigator program, as it has already brought together a strong team of behavioral, clinical, imaging, computational, and genetics investigators as a closely integrated team, and most importantly has attracted a very talented group of young investigators and graduate students focused on the problems addressed in the proposed research. A unifying theme of the studies that our team has proposed is the notion that math failure, and perhaps academic failure more broadly, emerges gradually through interactions of putative early conceptual weaknesses, attributable in some cases to poor functioning and anomalous neural architecture in specific neural systems, with increasing reward-based biases that contribute, additively or non-additively, to suppression of the normal learning trajectory. Consistent with this theme we refer to our proposed research hub as the Roles of Emotion and Choice (REaCh) in Learning Disabilities Research Hub (LDRH). The proposed REaCh Hub has 3 components: a new research project to investigate key questions about learning and the neural architecture during eariy development in children at high risk for math failure, and two cores. The Administrative Core proposal describes the management  plan for the new Hub and the PING infrastructure that will be adapted for the new studies; and focuses on a  nested mentoring plan for ensuring close interaction between trainees at different levels with mid-level and  senior investigators within focused workgroups. The assets of the Core for within-Hub and extra-Hub data sharing are also described. A Developmental Infrastructure Core proposal describes the administration of a small grant program to support novel work within the Hub by junior investigators, trainees, and investigators  from disciplines outside ofthe original REaCh LDRH group.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A new Learning Disabilities Research Hub would be created to bring scientists with different kinds of expertise together to study learning disabilities, focuing initially on risk for math failure in young children.  The scientists would study learning and brai development in children and focus specifically on the importance of the children's emotional responses to mathematical information.              A new Learning Disabilities Research Hub would be created to bring scientists with different kinds of expertise together to study learning disabilities, focuing initially on risk for math failure in young children.

"A preschool biomarker for literacy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as one in ten children have the poor reading and spelling skills that comprise developmental dyslexia. It is widely accepted that there is a neurological basis; however, the nature of that basis is hotly debated. Nevertheless, one consistent view is that poor phonological processing-the ability to access and manipulate the sound units of language-is involved in dyslexia. Indeed, a majority of children with reading deficits exhibit difficulties on an array of phonological processing tasks. A growing body of research has discovered that speech-sound transcription, as measured by electrophysiology, shows striking relationships with phonological processing skills and reading ability in school-age children. As such, we have developed a suite of subcortical and cortical physiological tests that probe some of the core deficits that researchers have postulated as the root elements of poor phonological processing. We will target the subcortical processing of time-varying signals and stimulus regularities, and cortical hemispheric specialization to both fast and slow signals. In a longitudinal cohort of four- to eight-year-olds, we will model the normal neurological speech transcription process, quantify its development, and examine its relationship with the development of literacy-related skills. Our intention is that by leveraging these electrophysiological probes to a pre-reading age group, a biomarker, in preschoolers, may be found that predicts a child's eventual reading skill as he/she progresses through the primary grades. If such a biomarker is found, it would pave the way for earlier and more effectively targeted intervention.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As objective neurophysiological measures of literacy become available, a logical step is to apply what has been learned about subcortical and cortical physiology and their relationships with reading to young pre- readers. The outcome of the proposed work will be a deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings of literacy, particularly in pre-literate children, and a means to exploit objective biological responses as biomarkers of future literacy. This outcome will positively impact our understanding of the core deficits leading to poor reading, and has the potential to spur early intervention programs to head off the potential onset of developmental dyslexia.              As objective neurophysiological measures of literacy become available, a logical step is to apply what has been learned about subcortical and cortical physiology and their relationships with reading to young pre- readers.

"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy. FASD is thought to represent the leading known preventable causes of neurobehavioral impairment in the U.S. and perhaps throughout the world. The proposed study offers the opportunity within the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) consortium of projects to describe the spectrum of alcoholrelated effects, to identify risk factors that are antecedent to pregnancy outcome, to test within-pregnancy interventions, and also to test methods that will allow for earlier identification of alcohol-related birth outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will utilize a prospective cohort study design involving pregnant women and their offspring recruited in Russia and Ukraine to address major gaps in knowledge about FASD by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to more fully delineate the complete range of expression of FASD in relation to specific quantities, patterns and gestational timing of alcohol exposure, and to evaluate the sensitivity of methods for earlier recognition of affected children; 2) to assess the contribution of maternal nutritional status in relation to physical and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, and to test the benefit of maternal second and third trimester supplementation with multinutrients with or without choline with respect to risk for FASD in the offspring; and 3) in collaboration with other CIFASD investigators, to provide a well-characterized sample of mothers/children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol for testing of alternative and earlier methods of identifying affected children, including prenatal ultrasound and post-natal 3D facial imaging. The proposed research has public health relevance from the standpoint of providing an improved estimate of the magnitude and scope of alcoholrelated developmental problems in the context of specific quantities and patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure using standardized methods for assessment, and from the standpoint of developing and validating critically necessary clinical methods for improved and early recognition of affected children and testing the potential benefit of a reasonably applied prenatal intervention that may help ameliorate negative outcomes.          n/a",Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine,8121650,U01AA014835,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional status', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'alcohol testing', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal intervention', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2011,521526,-0.05995587732650195
"Bio-behavioral chronic disease management by families of young minority children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (09) Health Disparities and specific Challenge Topic 09-MD- 102 Trans-disciplinary Research to Integrate the Biological and Non-biological Determinants of Health to Address Health Disparities. Description ""Bio-behavioral chronic disease management by families of young minority children"" seeks to reduce health disparities by investigating methods to close the gap between health information and health behaviors- specifically, the gap between instruction provided by clinicians to families of young children with chronic diseases and the capacity of economically stressed families to act on that instruction. Whether addressing asthma, diabetes, obesity, or tooth decay, needed now is trans-disciplinary translational research that tailors pharmacological and behavioral interventions to care management plans that parents are able to implement successfully. Envisioned is a computer ""Tool"" for use in community sites that assists community health workers in collaboration with families to: (1) determine children's level of risk for chronic diseases, (2) match them to clinicians and care plans, (3) characterize a family's capacity to engage in such plans, and (4) modify care plans to meet family's capacities. Target families are those disadvantaged by low-income, low-literacy, cultural barriers and minority status. Specific research aims are to develop, pilot test, and refine two ""Instruments"" that are integral to this Tool: (1) a 'disease risk assessment instrument' and (2) a culturally adaptable 'family capacity assessment instrument.' Early childhood caries (""ECC"") was selected as the exemplar chronic disease for this research by an existing 12-member multi-disciplinary Project Team comprised of social and behavioral scientists, clinicians, educational and informatics technologists, and health services researchers. ECC was selected because it is highly prevalent in young children, because preventive and therapeutic bio- behavioral therapies are available but underused, and because significant cost savings may accrue to governmental programs, insurers, and families if the need for dental repair can be reduced. The proposed 'disease risk assessment instrument' will experiment with inputting recognized biological (clinical, laboratory, psychological, and pharmacologic), and non biological (knowledge, logistic, socio-cultural, and environmental) risk factors into algorithm-supported ""classification and regression tree analyses"" and machine learning ""artificial neural networks"" to improve on current professionally-endorsed methods of classifying young children by risk. As the proposed 'family capacity assessment instrument' has been less developed to date by the Project Team, its ultimate form will be determined by this research. Success in developing and implementing the Tool and its two assessment Instruments can result in better oral health outcomes at lower cost through risk-based early intervention, disease suppression, individualized care, family engagement, and elimination of the need for dental surgery in children under the age of six. Findings of this research will support clinical trials of risk-based caries management in vulnerable minority child populations and is adaptable to management of other chronic diseases in young children.

"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD. n/a",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01,7900037,U01AA017124,"['3-Dimensional', 'A Mouse', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Fiber', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Labyrinth', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menstruation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nasal septum structure', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'computer generated', 'craniofacial', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'meetings', 'member', 'membranous labyrinth', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sensory system', 'social', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure', 'web site']",NIAAA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2010,242586,0.022559056158384744
"Bio-behavioral chronic disease management by families of young minority children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (09) Health Disparities and specific Challenge Topic 09-MD- 102 Trans-disciplinary Research to Integrate the Biological and Non-biological Determinants of Health to Address Health Disparities. Description ""Bio-behavioral chronic disease management by families of young minority children"" seeks to reduce health disparities by investigating methods to close the gap between health information and health behaviors- specifically, the gap between instruction provided by clinicians to families of young children with chronic diseases and the capacity of economically stressed families to act on that instruction. Whether addressing asthma, diabetes, obesity, or tooth decay, needed now is trans-disciplinary translational research that tailors pharmacological and behavioral interventions to care management plans that parents are able to implement successfully. Envisioned is a computer ""Tool"" for use in community sites that assists community health workers in collaboration with families to: (1) determine children's level of risk for chronic diseases, (2) match them to clinicians and care plans, (3) characterize a family's capacity to engage in such plans, and (4) modify care plans to meet family's capacities. Target families are those disadvantaged by low-income, low-literacy, cultural barriers and minority status. Specific research aims are to develop, pilot test, and refine two ""Instruments"" that are integral to this Tool: (1) a 'disease risk assessment instrument' and (2) a culturally adaptable 'family capacity assessment instrument.' Early childhood caries (""ECC"") was selected as the exemplar chronic disease for this research by an existing 12-member multi-disciplinary Project Team comprised of social and behavioral scientists, clinicians, educational and informatics technologists, and health services researchers. ECC was selected because it is highly prevalent in young children, because preventive and therapeutic bio- behavioral therapies are available but underused, and because significant cost savings may accrue to governmental programs, insurers, and families if the need for dental repair can be reduced. The proposed 'disease risk assessment instrument' will experiment with inputting recognized biological (clinical, laboratory, psychological, and pharmacologic), and non biological (knowledge, logistic, socio-cultural, and environmental) risk factors into algorithm-supported ""classification and regression tree analyses"" and machine learning ""artificial neural networks"" to improve on current professionally-endorsed methods of classifying young children by risk. As the proposed 'family capacity assessment instrument' has been less developed to date by the Project Team, its ultimate form will be determined by this research. Success in developing and implementing the Tool and its two assessment Instruments can result in better oral health outcomes at lower cost through risk-based early intervention, disease suppression, individualized care, family engagement, and elimination of the need for dental surgery in children under the age of six. Findings of this research will support clinical trials of risk-based caries management in vulnerable minority child populations and is adaptable to management of other chronic diseases in young children.

"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy. FASD is thought to represent the leading known preventable causes of neurobehavioral impairment in the U.S. and perhaps throughout the world. The proposed study offers the opportunity within the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) consortium of projects to describe the spectrum of alcoholrelated effects, to identify risk factors that are antecedent to pregnancy outcome, to test within-pregnancy interventions, and also to test methods that will allow for earlier identification of alcohol-related birth outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will utilize a prospective cohort study design involving pregnant women and their offspring recruited in Russia and Ukraine to address major gaps in knowledge about FASD by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to more fully delineate the complete range of expression of FASD in relation to specific quantities, patterns and gestational timing of alcohol exposure, and to evaluate the sensitivity of methods for earlier recognition of affected children; 2) to assess the contribution of maternal nutritional status in relation to physical and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, and to test the benefit of maternal second and third trimester supplementation with multinutrients with or without choline with respect to risk for FASD in the offspring; and 3) in collaboration with other CIFASD investigators, to provide a well-characterized sample of mothers/children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol for testing of alternative and earlier methods of identifying affected children, including prenatal ultrasound and post-natal 3D facial imaging. The proposed research has public health relevance from the standpoint of providing an improved estimate of the magnitude and scope of alcoholrelated developmental problems in the context of specific quantities and patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure using standardized methods for assessment, and from the standpoint of developing and validating critically necessary clinical methods for improved and early recognition of affected children and testing the potential benefit of a reasonably applied prenatal intervention that may help ameliorate negative outcomes.          n/a",Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine,7668663,U01AA014835,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional status', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'alcohol testing', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal intervention', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2009,630076,-0.05995587732650195

This RFA calls for, in part, research aimed at ""improved diagnosis"" and ""enhanced understanding of the domains of neurobehavioral impairment"" of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Although 30 years of research have identified myriad deficits in individuals with FASD, most neuropsychological studies are plagued by the question of global dysfunction vs. a pattern of relative sparing and impaired function. Delineation of a neuropsychological profile has been the subject of much recent debate. Limited research, including the current CIFASD consortium, has examined if prenatal alcohol exposure results in general dysfunction or a more specific neurobehavioral profile of strengths and weaknesses. The primary aim of this project is to determine whether a neurobehavioral phenotype exists in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, whether the same phenotype exists in children with FASD who lack facial dysmorphology, and whether the phenotype can be used for differential diagnosis. Secondary aims, involving collaboration with other CIFASD projects and cores, are to determine the relationship between brain dysmorphology, facial dysmorphology, and neurobehavioral function. These aims are in keeping with the overall aims of the CIFASD, including enhanced understanding of the neurobehavioral phenotype and establishment of standardized diagnostic criteria and methods of assessment of FASD. A standard neurobehavioral protocol will be administered to four groups of children at six sites and will address the functional domains of executive function, working memory, verbal function, and psychological symptomatology. In addition to children with FASD and nonexposed controls, children with low IQ scores or ADHD will be included as contrast samples. Using this heterogeneous sample and multivariate statistical methods, neurobehavioral profile specific to FASD will be sought. In addition, participants will be assessed using methodology prescribed by the Dysmorphology Core and the facial and brain imaging projects of the CIFASD. Data from three broad domains (neurobehavior, dysmorphology, and brain morphology and function) will be analyzed both separately and together to address the main aim of the CIFASD: improving the diagnostic criteria for FASD. This project is directly relevant to public health concerns surrounding the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, improving diagnosis of alcohol-affected individuals, and defining the profile of neurobehavioral effects that are specific to FASD.

"Dysmorphology Core - U24    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since 1973 when the specific pattern of malformation referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) was first delineated, it has become clear that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with a broad spectrum of structural anomalies as well as neurobehavioral deficits now referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). However, the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol is unknown and the incidence of specific anomalies or clusters of anomalies associated with specific patterns of prenatal alcohol consumption are poorly understood. Over the previous three years of the Consortium, the Dysmorphology Core has established a standard comprehensive protocol for physical evaluation of children in order to assure consistency in identification of the broad spectrum of features that constitute FASD at all sites. We propose to continue to support these activities throughout the renewal period in children during the first year of life at Consortium sites in prospective studies in Moscow Region, Russia, and Rivne, Ukraine as well as in older children in retrospective studies in Los Angeles, CA, San Diego, CA, Albuquerque, NM, the Northern Plains states, Atlanta, GA, and Cape Town, South Africa. Identification of large numbers of children at various ages with FAS as well as those with some features of the disorder but not enough to presently qualify them for that diagnosis (FASD), each of whom has received a standardized clinical examination, as well as neurobehavioral evaluation, neuroimaging studies, 3D photographs and, in the prospective studies, prenatal ultrasound studies, will provide the opportunity to address hypotheses regarding the relationship between FASD-related structural defects identified through the standard physical examination with complementary diagnostic methods that are being tested in other Consortium projects. The specific aims of this project are to assure consistency as well as accuracy in recognition of FASD at all CIFASD project sites where children are being evaluated; to delineate the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol in order to determine the boundaries that encompass FASD in prospective as well as retrospective studies involved in the Consortium; to identify specific structural features or clusters of features that are predictive of or correlated with deficits in neurobehavioral development across developmental ages spanning from infancy to adolescence; to correlate the specific structural features or clusters of features identified on the CIFASD standard physical examination with alternative or complementary methods that are being tested in other CIFASD projects; and to better understand the extent to which structural features of FASD are related to specific defects in the development of the brain.          n/a",Dysmorphology Core - U24,7668725,U24AA014815,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Examination', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neuroimaging', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pediatrician', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2009,162359,-0.028665519546390864
"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD.           n/a",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01,7668689,U01AA017124,"['3-Dimensional', 'A Mouse', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Fiber', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Labyrinth', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menstruation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nasal septum structure', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'computer generated', 'craniofacial', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'meetings', 'member', 'membranous labyrinth', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sensory system', 'social', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure', 'web site']",NIAAA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2009,237539,0.022559056158384744
"3D Facial Imaging in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the past three years, members of the Facial Imaging Core have worked with the Consortium to apply novel methods to more effectively diagnose FAS using 3D images from an ethnically diverse sample. These data and their subsequent analyses were used to identify features which consistently and reliably distinguished individuals with a clinical diagnosis of FAS from controls. Based on the initial success of the 'Facial Imaging Core', we now propose an expanded series of aims to be part of a clinical project named '3D Facial Imaging in FASD'. Subsequent work proposed in this study will build on the lessons learned in this first phase of research and utilize improved technology and sampling procedures to extend the diagnostic utility of these novel techniques to a wider range of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure or FASD. In collaboration with several clinical projects, we will collect a longitudinal, multi-ethnic sample of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol. This sample will allow us to reliably separate the effects of ethnic variation and developmental age from those due to alcohol exposure. We will also continue to work with the basic science projects to ensure that results in the different species (human, mouse, sheep) are used to inform analyses in each project.

"Dysmorphology Core - U24    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since 1973 when the specific pattern of malformation referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) was first delineated, it has become clear that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with a broad spectrum of structural anomalies as well as neurobehavioral deficits now referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). However, the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol is unknown and the incidence of specific anomalies or clusters of anomalies associated with specific patterns of prenatal alcohol consumption are poorly understood. Over the previous three years of the Consortium, the Dysmorphology Core has established a standard comprehensive protocol for physical evaluation of children in order to assure consistency in identification of the broad spectrum of features that constitute FASD at all sites. We propose to continue to support these activities throughout the renewal period in children during the first year of life at Consortium sites in prospective studies in Moscow Region, Russia, and Rivne, Ukraine as well as in older children in retrospective studies in Los Angeles, CA, San Diego, CA, Albuquerque, NM, the Northern Plains states, Atlanta, GA, and Cape Town, South Africa. Identification of large numbers of children at various ages with FAS as well as those with some features of the disorder but not enough to presently qualify them for that diagnosis (FASD), each of whom has received a standardized clinical examination, as well as neurobehavioral evaluation, neuroimaging studies, 3D photographs and, in the prospective studies, prenatal ultrasound studies, will provide the opportunity to address hypotheses regarding the relationship between FASD-related structural defects identified through the standard physical examination with complementary diagnostic methods that are being tested in other Consortium projects. The specific aims of this project are to assure consistency as well as accuracy in recognition of FASD at all CIFASD project sites where children are being evaluated; to delineate the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol in order to determine the boundaries that encompass FASD in prospective as well as retrospective studies involved in the Consortium; to identify specific structural features or clusters of features that are predictive of or correlated with deficits in neurobehavioral development across developmental ages spanning from infancy to adolescence; to correlate the specific structural features or clusters of features identified on the CIFASD standard physical examination with alternative or complementary methods that are being tested in other CIFASD projects; and to better understand the extent to which structural features of FASD are related to specific defects in the development of the brain.          n/a",Dysmorphology Core - U24,7502755,U24AA014815,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'All Sites', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Examination', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neuroimaging', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'prenatal', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2008,159503,-0.028665519546390864
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"" (Notice RFA-AA-03-004) to continue and expand the current multidisciplinary CIFASD. This RFA calls for, in part, research aimed at ""improved diagnosis"" and ""enhanced understanding of the domains of neurobehavioral impairment"" of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Although 30 years of research have identified myriad deficits in individuals with FASD, most neuropsychological studies are plagued by the question of global dysfunction vs. a pattern of relative sparing and impaired function. Delineation of a neuropsychological profile has been the subject of much recent debate. Limited research, including the current CIFASD consortium, has examined if prenatal alcohol exposure results in general dysfunction or a more specific neurobehavioral profile of strengths and weaknesses. The primary aim of this project is to determine whether a neurobehavioral phenotype exists in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, whether the same phenotype exists in children with FASD who lack facial dysmorphology, and whether the phenotype can be used for differential diagnosis. Secondary aims, involving collaboration with other CIFASD projects and cores, are to determine the relationship between brain dysmorphology, facial dysmorphology, and neurobehavioral function. These aims are in keeping with the overall aims of the CIFASD, including enhanced understanding of the neurobehavioral phenotype and establishment of standardized diagnostic criteria and methods of assessment of FASD. A standard neurobehavioral protocol will be administered to four groups of children at six sites and will address the functional domains of executive function, working memory, verbal function, and psychological symptomatology. In addition to children with FASD and nonexposed controls, children with low IQ scores or ADHD will be included as contrast samples. Using this heterogeneous sample and multivariate statistical methods, neurobehavioral profile specific to FASD will be sought. In addition, participants will be assessed using methodology prescribed by the Dysmorphology Core and the facial and brain imaging projects of the CIFASD. Data from three broad domains (neurobehavior, dysmorphology, and brain morphology and function) will be analyzed both separately and together to address the main aim of the CIFASD: improving the diagnostic criteria for FASD. This project is directly relevant to public health concerns surrounding the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, improving diagnosis of alcohol-affected individuals, and defining the profile of neurobehavioral effects that are specific to FASD. Improved identification and delineation of these features will ultimately lead to improved treatment.           n/a",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,7502760,U01AA014834,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plague', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'statistics', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2008,651718,-0.04904719724030616
"Using Absence-Causing Symptoms to Monitor Child Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       On any given weekday, more than one-fifth of the U.S. population is in schools. While we all want schools to be safe places-havens for learning-schoolchildren today face serious health threats including bioterrorism. In the proper project, we will develop and evaluate a system called ASIAN (Absenteeism-causing Symptom-Level Assessment Network), designed to monitor the health of children in schools. Our system focuses on monitoring children's school attendance, because most experts agree that absenteeism from school is an early sign of an outbreak in a community. However, school absenteeism is not a precise sign of an outbreak or epidemic. Absenteeism is often not even related to illness, reflecting, instead, problems in the child's home environment, important social or cultural obligations, and even opportunities for family recreation. But what if a system could identify absences due to illnesses and collect data on the symptoms causing the illness-related absences? Such a system might well offer an early, highly specific signal of an illness in a population, allowing public and school health officials to detect outbreaks in schools very early in their course. We propose to develop a VoiceXML speech processing system that can accurately capture during a brief telephone interview the symptoms a person is experiencing that are causing an absence. We propose to modify the ""work processes"" school districts use to have parents or guardians report that their children will be absent from school. Parents will use the interactive voice response questionnaire (or a web site, if they prefer) to report (on a voluntary basis) the symptoms that are causing the child's absence. We believe that monitoring of reports of such symptoms could both protect the health of children from bioterrorist attacks and from toxins in the environment. It could also improve their health on a daily basis by helping school nurses identify children with poorly managed chronic illnesses, and recognize and manage the routine outbreaks of infectious diseases that occur each year. The study plan focuses on creation of a computer telephone interviewing system and a formative evaluation that will include both qualitative and quantitative components and will assess the feasibility, validity, and potential usefulness of the system.             n/a",Using Absence-Causing Symptoms to Monitor Child Health,7497109,R21EB007466,"['Absenteeism', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asthma', 'Bioterrorism', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computers', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Education', 'Educational Materials', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Environment', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exanthema', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fever', 'Goals', 'Head Nurses', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Incentives', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Just-in-time-concept', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Natural Disasters', 'Nausea', 'Nursing Schools', 'Occupational Health Nursing', 'Parents', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Primary Schools', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Questionnaires', 'Readiness', 'Recreation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'School Nursing', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Terrorism', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Toxin', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'hazard', 'high school', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'school health', 'social', 'speech processing', 'syndromic surveillance', 'tool', 'voice recognition']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2008,189263,0.03320855487777171
"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD.           n/a",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01,7502729,U01AA017124,"['3-Dimensional', 'A Mouse', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emotional', 'End Point', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Fiber', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Labyrinth', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menstruation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nasal septum structure', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Week', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'computer generated', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'day', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'membranous labyrinth', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sensory system', 'size', 'social', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2008,234161,0.022559056158384744
"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy. FASD is thought to represent the leading known preventable causes of neurobehavioral impairment in the U.S. and perhaps throughout the world. The proposed study offers the opportunity within the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) consortium of projects to describe the spectrum of alcoholrelated effects, to identify risk factors that are antecedent to pregnancy outcome, to test within-pregnancy interventions, and also to test methods that will allow for earlier identification of alcohol-related birth outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will utilize a prospective cohort study design involving pregnant women and their offspring recruited in Russia and Ukraine to address major gaps in knowledge about FASD by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to more fully delineate the complete range of expression of FASD in relation to specific quantities, patterns and gestational timing of alcohol exposure, and to evaluate the sensitivity of methods for earlier recognition of affected children; 2) to assess the contribution of maternal nutritional status in relation to physical and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, and to test the benefit of maternal second and third trimester supplementation with multinutrients with or without choline with respect to risk for FASD in the offspring; and 3) in collaboration with other CIFASD investigators, to provide a well-characterized sample of mothers/children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol for testing of alternative and earlier methods of identifying affected children, including prenatal ultrasound and post-natal 3D facial imaging. The proposed research has public health relevance from the standpoint of providing an improved estimate of the magnitude and scope of alcoholrelated developmental problems in the context of specific quantities and patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure using standardized methods for assessment, and from the standpoint of developing and validating critically necessary clinical methods for improved and early recognition of affected children and testing the potential benefit of a reasonably applied prenatal intervention that may help ameliorate negative outcomes.          n/a",Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine,7502741,U01AA014835,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Coordination and Collaboration', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gender Role', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Micronutrients', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Numbers', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional status', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patient currently pregnant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Sudden infant death syndrome', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translational Research', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'absorption', 'alcohol consumption during pregnancy', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'alcohol testing', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'cohort', 'compare effectiveness', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'performance site', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal intervention', 'processing speed', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'social', 'stillbirth', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2008,690277,-0.05995587732650195
"3D Facial Imaging in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the past three years, members of the Facial Imaging Core have worked with the Consortium to apply novel methods to more effectively diagnose FAS using 3D images from an ethnically diverse sample. These data and their subsequent analyses were used to identify features which consistently and reliably distinguished individuals with a clinical diagnosis of FAS from controls. Based on the initial success of the 'Facial Imaging Core', we now propose an expanded series of aims to be part of a clinical project named '3D Facial Imaging in FASD'. Subsequent work proposed in this study will build on the lessons learned in this first phase of research and utilize improved technology and sampling procedures to extend the diagnostic utility of these novel techniques to a wider range of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure or FASD. In collaboration with several clinical projects, we will collect a longitudinal, multi-ethnic sample of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol. This sample will allow us to reliably separate the effects of ethnic variation and developmental age from those due to alcohol exposure. We will also continue to work with the basic science projects to ensure that results in the different species (human, mouse, sheep) are used to inform analyses in each project. The overarching goals of this project are to: Goal 1: improve understanding of the dysmorphic features in FAS and FASD; Goal 2: enhance the capability for definitive diagnosis of FAS and the broader spectrum of FASD at different stages of the lifespan; and Goal 3: establish whether there is a relationship between FAS and FASD dysmorphic features and the specific underlying impairments in brain function.           n/a",3D Facial Imaging in FASD (U01),7342564,U01AA014809,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'disorder control', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'success', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2007,359361,-0.054415530220263804
"Dysmorphology Core - U24    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since 1973 when the specific pattern of malformation referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) was first delineated, it has become clear that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with a broad spectrum of structural anomalies as well as neurobehavioral deficits now referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). However, the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol is unknown and the incidence of specific anomalies or clusters of anomalies associated with specific patterns of prenatal alcohol consumption are poorly understood. Over the previous three years of the Consortium, the Dysmorphology Core has established a standard comprehensive protocol for physical evaluation of children in order to assure consistency in identification of the broad spectrum of features that constitute FASD at all sites. We propose to continue to support these activities throughout the renewal period in children during the first year of life at Consortium sites in prospective studies in Moscow Region, Russia, and Rivne, Ukraine as well as in older children in retrospective studies in Los Angeles, CA, San Diego, CA, Albuquerque, NM, the Northern Plains states, Atlanta, GA, and Cape Town, South Africa. Identification of large numbers of children at various ages with FAS as well as those with some features of the disorder but not enough to presently qualify them for that diagnosis (FASD), each of whom has received a standardized clinical examination, as well as neurobehavioral evaluation, neuroimaging studies, 3D photographs and, in the prospective studies, prenatal ultrasound studies, will provide the opportunity to address hypotheses regarding the relationship between FASD-related structural defects identified through the standard physical examination with complementary diagnostic methods that are being tested in other Consortium projects. The specific aims of this project are to assure consistency as well as accuracy in recognition of FASD at all CIFASD project sites where children are being evaluated; to delineate the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol in order to determine the boundaries that encompass FASD in prospective as well as retrospective studies involved in the Consortium; to identify specific structural features or clusters of features that are predictive of or correlated with deficits in neurobehavioral development across developmental ages spanning from infancy to adolescence; to correlate the specific structural features or clusters of features identified on the CIFASD standard physical examination with alternative or complementary methods that are being tested in other CIFASD projects; and to better understand the extent to which structural features of FASD are related to specific defects in the development of the brain.          n/a",Dysmorphology Core - U24,7345662,U24AA014815,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'All Sites', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Examination', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neuroimaging', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'prenatal', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,U24,2007,153891,-0.028665519546390864
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"" (Notice RFA-AA-03-004) to continue and expand the current multidisciplinary CIFASD. This RFA calls for, in part, research aimed at ""improved diagnosis"" and ""enhanced understanding of the domains of neurobehavioral impairment"" of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Although 30 years of research have identified myriad deficits in individuals with FASD, most neuropsychological studies are plagued by the question of global dysfunction vs. a pattern of relative sparing and impaired function. Delineation of a neuropsychological profile has been the subject of much recent debate. Limited research, including the current CIFASD consortium, has examined if prenatal alcohol exposure results in general dysfunction or a more specific neurobehavioral profile of strengths and weaknesses. The primary aim of this project is to determine whether a neurobehavioral phenotype exists in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, whether the same phenotype exists in children with FASD who lack facial dysmorphology, and whether the phenotype can be used for differential diagnosis. Secondary aims, involving collaboration with other CIFASD projects and cores, are to determine the relationship between brain dysmorphology, facial dysmorphology, and neurobehavioral function. These aims are in keeping with the overall aims of the CIFASD, including enhanced understanding of the neurobehavioral phenotype and establishment of standardized diagnostic criteria and methods of assessment of FASD. A standard neurobehavioral protocol will be administered to four groups of children at six sites and will address the functional domains of executive function, working memory, verbal function, and psychological symptomatology. In addition to children with FASD and nonexposed controls, children with low IQ scores or ADHD will be included as contrast samples. Using this heterogeneous sample and multivariate statistical methods, neurobehavioral profile specific to FASD will be sought. In addition, participants will be assessed using methodology prescribed by the Dysmorphology Core and the facial and brain imaging projects of the CIFASD. Data from three broad domains (neurobehavior, dysmorphology, and brain morphology and function) will be analyzed both separately and together to address the main aim of the CIFASD: improving the diagnostic criteria for FASD. This project is directly relevant to public health concerns surrounding the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, improving diagnosis of alcohol-affected individuals, and defining the profile of neurobehavioral effects that are specific to FASD. Improved identification and delineation of these features will ultimately lead to improved treatment.           n/a",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,7343382,U01AA014834,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plague', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'statistics', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2007,740297,-0.04904719724030616
"Using Absence-Causing Symptoms to Monitor Child Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       On any given weekday, more than one-fifth of the U.S. population is in schools. While we all want schools to be safe places-havens for learning-schoolchildren today face serious health threats including bioterrorism. In the proper project, we will develop and evaluate a system called ASIAN (Absenteeism-causing Symptom-Level Assessment Network), designed to monitor the health of children in schools. Our system focuses on monitoring children's school attendance, because most experts agree that absenteeism from school is an early sign of an outbreak in a community. However, school absenteeism is not a precise sign of an outbreak or epidemic. Absenteeism is often not even related to illness, reflecting, instead, problems in the child's home environment, important social or cultural obligations, and even opportunities for family recreation. But what if a system could identify absences due to illnesses and collect data on the symptoms causing the illness-related absences? Such a system might well offer an early, highly specific signal of an illness in a population, allowing public and school health officials to detect outbreaks in schools very early in their course. We propose to develop a VoiceXML speech processing system that can accurately capture during a brief telephone interview the symptoms a person is experiencing that are causing an absence. We propose to modify the ""work processes"" school districts use to have parents or guardians report that their children will be absent from school. Parents will use the interactive voice response questionnaire (or a web site, if they prefer) to report (on a voluntary basis) the symptoms that are causing the child's absence. We believe that monitoring of reports of such symptoms could both protect the health of children from bioterrorist attacks and from toxins in the environment. It could also improve their health on a daily basis by helping school nurses identify children with poorly managed chronic illnesses, and recognize and manage the routine outbreaks of infectious diseases that occur each year. The study plan focuses on creation of a computer telephone interviewing system and a formative evaluation that will include both qualitative and quantitative components and will assess the feasibility, validity, and potential usefulness of the system.             n/a",Using Absence-Causing Symptoms to Monitor Child Health,7529060,R21EB007466,"['Absenteeism', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asthma', 'Bioterrorism', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computers', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Education', 'Educational Materials', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Environment', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exanthema', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fever', 'Goals', 'Head Nurses', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Incentives', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Just-in-time-concept', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Natural Disasters', 'Nausea', 'Nursing Schools', 'Occupational Health Nursing', 'Parents', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Primary Schools', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Questionnaires', 'Readiness', 'Recreation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'School Nursing', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Terrorism', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Toxin', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'hazard', 'high school', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'research study', 'response', 'school health', 'social', 'speech processing', 'syndromic surveillance', 'tool', 'voice recognition']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,R21,2007,231750,0.03320855487777171
"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD.           n/a",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01,7343348,U01AA017124,"['3-Dimensional', 'A Mouse', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emotional', 'End Point', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Fiber', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Labyrinth', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menstruation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nasal septum structure', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Week', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'computer generated', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'day', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'membranous labyrinth', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sensory system', 'size', 'social', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2007,225000,0.022559056158384744
"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy. FASD is thought to represent the leading known preventable causes of neurobehavioral impairment in the U.S. and perhaps throughout the world. The proposed study offers the opportunity within the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) consortium of projects to describe the spectrum of alcoholrelated effects, to identify risk factors that are antecedent to pregnancy outcome, to test within-pregnancy interventions, and also to test methods that will allow for earlier identification of alcohol-related birth outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will utilize a prospective cohort study design involving pregnant women and their offspring recruited in Russia and Ukraine to address major gaps in knowledge about FASD by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to more fully delineate the complete range of expression of FASD in relation to specific quantities, patterns and gestational timing of alcohol exposure, and to evaluate the sensitivity of methods for earlier recognition of affected children; 2) to assess the contribution of maternal nutritional status in relation to physical and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, and to test the benefit of maternal second and third trimester supplementation with multinutrients with or without choline with respect to risk for FASD in the offspring; and 3) in collaboration with other CIFASD investigators, to provide a well-characterized sample of mothers/children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol for testing of alternative and earlier methods of identifying affected children, including prenatal ultrasound and post-natal 3D facial imaging. The proposed research has public health relevance from the standpoint of providing an improved estimate of the magnitude and scope of alcoholrelated developmental problems in the context of specific quantities and patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure using standardized methods for assessment, and from the standpoint of developing and validating critically necessary clinical methods for improved and early recognition of affected children and testing the potential benefit of a reasonably applied prenatal intervention that may help ameliorate negative outcomes.          n/a",Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine,7343353,U01AA014835,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Coordination and Collaboration', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gender Role', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Micronutrients', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Numbers', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional status', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patient currently pregnant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Sudden infant death syndrome', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translational Research', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'absorption', 'alcohol consumption during pregnancy', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'alcohol testing', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'cohort', 'compare effectiveness', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'performance site', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal intervention', 'processing speed', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'social', 'stillbirth', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,U01,2007,656344,-0.05995587732650195

This strand will examine the effectiveness of both Phonological and Strategy         Training, Speeded Word Retrieval, and Repeated Reading strategies, both singly       and in combination. The effectiveness of these will be compared to a                 traditional remedial instruction control. Both immediate and long term               follow-up measures, on both standardized achievement and experimental                measures, will be conducted to follow the progress of these children.

"Determinants of Behavior Problems after Divorce  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processes responsible for the association between divorce and adjustment in adults and their offspring are not well understood. The higher rates of behavioral and psychological problems in adults and children from divorced families were originally considered to be consequences of marital disruption, but may also reflect nonrandom selection of families into divorce. In order to disentangle these processes, the proposed research will utilize data from a longitudinal study of Australian adult twins and their offspring. First, analyses of monozygotic and dizygotic adult twins discordant for divorce will examine how genetic and environmental processes account for the increased problems among divorced individuals. Second, the children of twins design will investigate the causal and selection factors responsible for the relation between marital dissolution and functioning in young-adult offspring. Third, the proposed analyses will assess how family and individual characteristics mediate the environmental and genetic influences associated with offspring's adjustment to their parents' divorce. Finally, training opportunities will provide the opportunity to explore whether the family environment controls genetic expression of offspring behavior problems, use longitudinal data to study developmental changes in children's response to family conflict, and employ decision tree analyses to study how multiple risk and protective factors interact to influence child development. The proposed research seeks to move beyond simple associations between familial characteristics and outcomes and elucidate causal mechanisms by utilizing genetically informative designs, longitudinal data, and advanced quantitative methods.   n/a",Determinants of Behavior Problems after Divorce,6656262,F31MH067300,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' behavioral genetics', ' clinical research', ' conflict', ' developmental psychology', ' divorce /separation', ' family structure /dynamics', ' functional ability', ' gene environment interaction', ' human data', ' longitudinal human study', ' parent offspring interaction', ' personality', ' predoctoral investigator', ' psychological adaptation', ' psychological stressor', ' social behavior', ' socioenvironment', ' twin /multiplet']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,F31,2003,25481,0.01776751155539975

"Determinants of Behavior Problems after Divorce  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processes responsible for the association between divorce and adjustment in adults and their offspring are not well understood. The higher rates of behavioral and psychological problems in adults and children from divorced families were originally considered to be consequences of marital disruption, but may also reflect nonrandom selection of families into divorce. In order to disentangle these processes, the proposed research will utilize data from a longitudinal study of Australian adult twins and their offspring. First, analyses of monozygotic and dizygotic adult twins discordant for divorce will examine how genetic and environmental processes account for the increased problems among divorced individuals. Second, the children of twins design will investigate the causal and selection factors responsible for the relation between marital dissolution and functioning in young-adult offspring. Third, the proposed analyses will assess how family and individual characteristics mediate the environmental and genetic influences associated with offspring's adjustment to their parents' divorce. Finally, training opportunities will provide the opportunity to explore whether the family environment controls genetic expression of offspring behavior problems, use longitudinal data to study developmental changes in children's response to family conflict, and employ decision tree analyses to study how multiple risk and protective factors interact to influence child development. The proposed research seeks to move beyond simple associations between familial characteristics and outcomes and elucidate causal mechanisms by utilizing genetically informative designs, longitudinal data, and advanced quantitative methods.   n/a",Determinants of Behavior Problems after Divorce,6582861,F31MH067300,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' behavioral genetics', ' clinical research', ' conflict', ' developmental psychology', ' divorce /separation', ' family structure /dynamics', ' functional ability', ' gene environment interaction', ' human data', ' longitudinal human study', ' parent offspring interaction', ' personality', ' predoctoral investigator', ' psychological adaptation', ' psychological stressor', ' social behavior', ' socioenvironment', ' twin /multiplet']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,F31,2002,23885,0.01776751155539975

"Mobile bedside ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in resource limited settings Project Summary In low and middle-income countries (LMICs) pneumonia is by far the leading cause of death among children < 5 years of age. Despite progress in reducing global pneumonia deaths, pneumonia still kills over 1 million children a year. A key factor is the challenge of pneumonia diagnosis. Chest X-Ray is the gold standard for pneumonia diagnoses but exposes children to ionizing radiation and is mainly restricted to hospital settings. Outside of hospitals, pneumonia is diagnosed based on clinical grounds using the WHO’s Integrated Management of Childhood Illness algorithms. However, that approach lacks specificity, resulting in significant overdiagnosis of pneumonia. That wastes precious resources, exposes children to antibiotics unnecessarily, and delays identification of the true cause of a child’s illness. Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in bedside ultrasound as a radiation-sparing alternative to X- Ray. The accuracy of bedside US for diagnosing pneumonia is comparable to X-Ray. However, traditional bedside US suffers the same limitations as X-Rays in terms of portability, and still requires interpretation of images by a trained radiologist. Recent innovations in ultrasound technology and artificial intelligence applications suggest a possible pathway forward. Bluetooth enabled US transponders that connect to a smart phone or tablet, effectively create a truly portable US suite that can fit into one’s pocket. Similarly, advances in artificial intelligence render possible the automated interpretation of mobile bedside US (mBSUS) images on a smart phone, obviating the need for a radiologist. The twin goals of this project are: 1) to compare the accuracy of the mobile, Bluetooth US system, linked to a cell phone, against the gold standard of Chest X-Ray for diagnosis of pneumonia among children aged 1-59 months; and 2) to apply machine learning algorithms to assist in the identification of accurate classification features that reliably identify lobar pneumonia. If successful, this would be a pivotal first step towards the goal of a truly portable yet still highly accurate approach to the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia that could function autonomously without the need for external evaluation by a skilled radiologist. Such a tool would revolutionize pneumonia case management in resource limited parts of the world and could save the lives of many.

"Effectiveness and predictors of response for a technology-based reading intervention in the home Project Summary/Abstract. Reading Disability (RD) is the most common learning disability, affecting 10 – 15% of school age children. It incurs major functional impairments at all stages of life, with a wealth of data documenting lifelong disadvantages in educational and occupational attainment. Therefore, identifying effective and affordable treatments for RD is a high priority for reading researchers, clinicians and educators. Problematically, current evidence-based reading interventions largely rely on services by trained specialists, either in well-resourced classrooms or clinical settings. As such, under-resourced schools (or countries) often are unable to provide reading interventions for their students. In recent years, technology-based reading interventions have been proposed as a means of overcoming these challenges, as they can be administered in the home, without direct expert supervision - thereby minimizing resource demands. In the area of reading-focused EdTech, GraphoLearn has emerged as a leader, with the largest evidence-base to date. However, the vast majority of studies to date have been conducted in highly controlled settings, rather than the home environment it was intended for – leaving open questions about effectiveness. Additionally, similar to any intervention, not all children with RD benefit equally from treatment; however little attention has been given to identifying predictors of treatment response. Here we propose to evaluate the effectiveness of home-administered GraphoLearn through the implementation of a large-scale, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 450 reading disabled children (boys and girls, ages 6.0- 10.0). To accomplish this goal rapidly and with minimal cost, we will recruit participants from the Healthy Brain Network [HBN], an ongoing study of mental health and learning disorders in children, ages 5.0-21.0, whose family have concerns about behavior and/or learning (target n = 10,000; current n = 3000+). The availability of comprehensive characterizations (e.g., demographic, cognitive, mental health, EEG, multimodal MRI) for all HBN participants makes the sample optimal for exploring an extensive set of participant and environmental factors that may affect treatment outcomes (i.e., demographic, cognitive, emotional, neurobiological, environmental). Specific aims of the proposed work are to: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of GraphoLearn in a large sample of children with RD, and 2) Identify participant-related and environment-level factors that are significantly associated with GraphoLearn outcomes. To accomplish this latter aim, sophisticated machine learning approaches (Random Forest Regression models) will be employed. Project Narrative This project is motivated by two significant overarching problems (1) existing avenues for reading intervention in the US are not available to most children in need of help, and (2) across children there is substantial variability in pre-to-post intervention gains in reading. This project will evaluate the effectiveness of a home delivered technology-based (Edtech) reading intervention in a large and diverse sample of children, and identify factors that facilitate (or hinder) positive Edtech intervention outcomes.",Effectiveness and predictors of response for a technology-based reading intervention in the home,10058660,R01HD101842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Country', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Children', 'Disadvantaged', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Learning Disorders', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Matched Group', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reading Disabilities', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Work', 'active control', 'base', 'boys', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'dosage', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'functional disability', 'girls', 'intervention effect', 'language impairment', 'multimodality', 'phonology', 'post intervention', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'random forest', 'remediation', 'response', 'skills', 'sound']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2020,688574,0.03493722422861532
"Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Project summary Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, occur in up to 5% of the population in the United States, and are associated with lifelong disability. There are multiple difficulties in obtaining an accurate diagnosis of FASD, including subtlety of physical features and heterogeneity in presentation. Consequently, FASD is grossly under-recognized, and the majority of affected children never receive a diagnosis. If FASD could be diagnosed earlier and with more reliability, many years of beneficial intervention would not be lost. The objective of this research is to apply machine learning to high-dimensional data in well-characterized data sets to predict or characterize children with FASD. The central hypothesis of this research is that the application of machine learning will accurately predict and recognize FASD compared with expert clinical diagnosis. To test this hypothesis, machine learning will be employed to: 1) characterize FASD based on the presence of non-cardinal malformations, 2) establish multivariate predictors of FASD in preschool aged children, and 3) identify diagnosis specific neurodevelopmental markers that distinguish alcohol related neurodevelopmental deficits from neurodevelopmental deficits without prenatal exposure. Two secondary data sources will be used in this proposal; a prospective study of 400 pregnant women and their offspring in Ukraine (half of whom consumed high amounts of alcohol) with full clinical evaluations for FASD, and a cross- sectional study of over 2,900 first grade children in four regions of the U.S., all with clinical FASD evaluations. Upon successful completion of the proposed research, the expected contribution is for more accurate prediction and recognition of children with FASD. The proposed research is innovative, as it represents a departure from current practice by incorporating machine learning techniques into predictive models of FASD. As a perinatal epidemiologist, I have a strong foundation in analytic techniques, and the advanced training in machine learning will further enhance these skills. Additionally, the disease-focused training in dysmorphology and neurodevelopment will provide a strong foundation to make significant contributions to the field of FASD research. Finally, training and mentoring in grant writing and the responsible conduct of research will provide a strong foundation to transition to an independent researcher. This proposed research builds on previous NIAAA funded research by my interdisciplinary mentoring team, who are all strongly supportive of this research and training plan. This seminal application of machine learning to FASD research will demonstrate its capacity to predict and identify affected children, ultimately leading to earlier intervention of children prenatally exposed to alcohol. Narrative Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are common and result in lifelong disabilities; however, they are clini- cally difficult to identify, and the vast majority of children with FASD are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The proposed research will leverage recent advances in machine learning to better identify children with FASD. These advances would lead to earlier identification and intervention in the lives of children prenatally exposed to alcohol, which can improve their developmental outcomes.",Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure,10018803,K01AA027811,"['Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Nursery Schools', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ukraine', 'United States', 'Writing', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aged', 'alcohol exposure', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'disability', 'fetal diagnosis', 'first grade', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malformation', 'multidimensional data', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel strategies', 'offspring', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'research clinical testing', 'responsible research conduct', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'success']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K01,2020,172808,-0.03147222217797966
"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,9999949,R00ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'adverse birth outcomes', 'base', 'big-data science', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data types', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'random forest', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2020,247463,0.09755816505626665
"Automatic Rib Fracture Detection in Pediatric Radiography to Identify Non-Accidental Trauma ABSTRACT Automatic Rib Fracture Detection in Pediatric Radiography to Identify Non-Accidental Trauma PI: Adam M. Alessio Non-accidental trauma caused by physical abuse is a leading cause of death in children in the United States. Because rib fractures are highly predictive of child abuse and chest radiographs are commonly performed for multiple indications, pediatric chest radiographs can have a critical role in the identification of abuse. Detection of rib fractures on pediatric radiographs is challenging and a high percentage of fractures are missed, particularly in imaging centers with limited pediatric radiology experience. Currently, there are no viable computer assisted strategies for rib fracture detection on chest radiographs. The purpose of this proposal is to develop machine learning methodology to detect rib fractures on pediatric radiographs using images from a network of hospitals. These methods will rely on a two-stage approach including a thoracic cavity segmentation stage followed by a fracture detection stage. We will explore two fracture detection strategies using novel supervised learning approaches: a heterogeneous U-net and a multi-modal regional-convolutional neural network. These methods will be trained and tested with a large set of fracture-absent radiographs (N=1000) from Seattle Children's Hospital and a diverse set of labelled fracture-present radiographs (N=500) from collaborating sites. These methods will be developed with an intentionally diverse set of radiographs, representative of the variety of fracture presentations and image quality in clinical practice, in order to position this rib fracture detection method for rapid translation to clinical practice. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to provide a computer assisted rib fracture assessment tool that would be a rapid and widely-available add-on to all pediatric chest radiograph exams, improving detection of rib fractures and potentially leading to improved identification of child abuse. NARRATIVE Automatic Rib Fracture Detection in Pediatric Radiography to Identify Non-Accidental Trauma PI: Adam M. Alessio Child abuse is a leading cause of death in children and rates of abuse are increasing. Detection of rib fractures on commonly performed chest radiographs has the potential to identify unsuspected child abuse, but it is very challenging to see fractures on these exams.

"Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings Abstract Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in low-income countries. In high-income countries, pediatric diarrhea remains a major utilization of healthcare resources. Treatment of diarrhea is mostly empiric, with antibiotic use mostly based on clinical suspicion for bacterial causes. However, the majority of cases of diarrhea do not benefit from antibiotic use, and inappropriate use leads to toxicity and resistance. Furthermore, despite the increasing availability of rapid molecular testing, there is little data to base a decision of whom or when to test. Our overarching goal is to develop and validate clinical decision tools for management of diarrheal illnesses in children of both high and low resource settings. We will utilize prospectively-collected data from two recently-completed multicenter cohort studies of pediatric diarrhea. These studies feature extensive etiologic testing, well-characterized clinical elements, and longitudinal outcome data. We have assembled a team with expertise in pediatric diarrhea, clinical prediction rules, and machine learning methods. In Aim 1, we will use domestic data to develop and validate: a) a score for bacterial etiology, and b) a score for which patients are likely to benefit from further testing. We will derive the scores using data from IMPACT, an NIH-sponsored study of 1200 children from 5 US Emergency Departments, and validate using electronic health records from the Utah Intermountain Health System. In Aim 2, we will use international data to develop and validate: a) a diagnostic score for bacterial etiology, and b) a prognostic score for risk stratification of children who go on to poor outcomes. We will derive the scores using data from GEMS, a study of over 9400 children across 7 low-resource countries, and validate using VIDA study of children in 3 African countries. Completion of the Aims will result in the availability of a number of clinical tools that healthcare workers worldwide can use for evidence-based care of children with diarrhea. Project Narrative Diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The management of childhood diarrhea often depend on what type of pathogen is responsible, but in many cases testing is not affordable or feasible. We propose studies to develop clinical scores to make it easier for healthcare workers to decide how to manage children with diarrhea.",Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings,9912093,R01AI135114,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Africa', 'African', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Case Management', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Enteral', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Income', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sample Size', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Utah', 'Vaccines', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical diagnostics', 'diarrheal disease', 'evidence base', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'machine learning method', 'microbial', 'molecular diagnostics', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,397159,0.02893550821101735
"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.",The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders,9949789,R01MH104030,"['Advertisements', 'Age', 'Anniversary', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family history of', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuropsychology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'brain abnormalities', 'caudate nucleus', 'comparison group', 'critical period', 'dexterity', 'follow-up', 'habit learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'medical attention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomenological models', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'secondary analysis', 'support vector machine', 'tic suppression', 'vector']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,662746,0.043536355798403176
"BRINGING MODERN DATA SCIENCE TOOLS TO BEAR ON ENVIRONMENTAL MIXTURES Project Summary: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time.

"Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development ABSTRACT This proposal will develop innovative technology for data-driven, multimodal characterization of nonverbal communication (NVC) in typical and atypical development. Prior research has provided qualitative descriptions of the development of children's use of gaze and gesture to regulate social interactions, but there are no objective, automated tools for measuring NVC behaviors, nor computational models to explain their coordination and timing in social interactions. This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children in the US. This project is focused on developing automated tools to characterize behaviors considered to be core, early emerging markers of autism, and that represent common treatment targets in this group.

"Biomarker Discovery for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Children Project Abstract Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the aggressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the most common liver disease in children in the United States. The disease affects almost 1/3 of all obese children, estimated to be approximately 7 million children. Treatment is based on lifestyle changes such as a low sugar diet and increasing exercise, but no therapeutics are approved for children or adults. Currently, diagnosis of NASH requires a liver biopsy, which is cumbersome, expensive and has inherent risk. The lack of 1) non-invasive biomarkers to diagnose NASH and 2) pharmacodynamic/response biomarkers of NASH to therapy are considered by many to be an important barrier in the field. These biomarkers are needed to advance clinical care, focusing resources on the children with the most progressive form of the disease. And they are needed to drive therapeutic development because children with NASH are prioritized for participation in clinical trials and response biomarkers for NASH are needed to become surrogate endpoint biomarkers for clinical trials to accelerate drug development. This proposal represents an exceptional multidisciplinary effort to address these important gaps in knowledge. The project will be led by Dr. Miriam Vos, expert in pediatric NAFLD and experienced in early biomarker development research. Co-investigators including Dr. Kristal Maner-Smith, expert in lipidomics and Dr. Ayman Akil, expert in machine learning and biomarker discovery. The team seeks to develop a panel of biomarkers to predict NASH and to reflect response of NASH to therapy through the 2 following aims. Aim 1 will define and validate a panel of metabolites and lipids diagnostic of NASH in children. Aim 2 will define and validate a panel of metabolites, lipids and clinical variables that are associated with treatment induced improvement in NASH. Aims 1 and 2 will both capitalize on the exceptionally high-quality samples available from the NASH clinical research network and deposited within the NIDDK Central Repository. Repository serum samples are available from two pediatric clinical studies including the NAFLD Database study and the TONIC randomized clinical trial and were collected near in time to a liver biopsy as well as with detailed clinical phenotyping. Validation cohort and control samples will be drawn from the Emory Liver Biopsy Biorepository study and an ongoing Healthy Control pediatric cohort at Emory. Preliminary data demonstrates strong associations between specific metabolites and pathologic features of NASH including hepatocyte ballooning, inflammation and steatosis supporting feasibility. These studies are designed to have a sustained, powerful impact on the pediatric NASH biomarker field and to directly improve the health of children through efficient diagnosis of NASH and successful therapeutic development for NASH. Project Narrative This proposal seeks to improve child health through detecting and validating novel biomarkers for pediatric nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, the more progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. The proposed program will apply a novel dental biomarker of exposure to multiple chemicals and cutting-edge statistical methods to identify specific life stages including perinatal periods that correspond to increased susceptibility to neurodevelopmental effects of metal toxicant mixtures.",Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture,10005934,R01ES026033,"['8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Arsenic', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cadmium', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Manganese', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Nutrient', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deciduous tooth', 'developmental neurotoxicity', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurodevelopmental effect', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'perinatal period', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'synergism', 'tool', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,604973,0.06104793966156467
"Role of the gut microbiome in pesticide-induced effects on child neurodevelopment SUMMARY Pesticides are pervasive in our environment, and have accumulated in drinking water reserves serving millions of people worldwide, causing growing concern since the potential adverse health effects are not fully understood. In 2017 alone, the world used about 6.8 million tons of pesticides, of which the world's largest usage is in China and the United States. More recently it has been discovered that pesticides have strong effects on microbial communities, extinguishing entire clades while promoting growth in others. Shifts in microbial composition have been associated with brain development, mood and behavior suggesting a strong link between the gut and the brain. We hypothesize that there may exist an unappreciated microbiome component to the adverse health effects of pesticide exposure. In this proposal, we will use a comprehensive approach to identify the microbial components of pesticide susceptibility to neurodevelopmental delay. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to 11 targeted pesticides on child neurodevelopment in a large well-defined human Mother and Child Microbiome Cohort (MCMC) consisting of 3000 mother and child pairs. Study participants are currently followed up regularly until the children reach 4 years of age. Comprehensive artificial intelligence analysis of pesticide exposure and children's early neurodevelopment data will identify key pesticides that negatively impact child development. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that prenatal exposure to pesticides can shift the composition of the GM and subsequently lead to abnormal neurodevelopment. We will integrate the child gut microbiome data with maternal pesticide exposure during pregnancy and child neurodevelopment data to investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to targeted pesticides on child gut microbiome and development. This Aim will identify specific gut bacteria or clades associated with child neurodevelopment. In Aim 3, we will use conventional and germ-free mouse models to elucidate mechanisms by which pesticide exposure can affect the gut microbiome and behavior. Conventionally housed pregnant mice will be exposed to pesticides and the gut microbiome and behavior (anxiety, memory, motor performance, social interaction) will be analyzed in their offspring. Also, germ-free mice will be colonized with specific bacteria or bacterial clades to study the causality of the impact of the GM on behavior. The long-term implications for human health are significant – it may be possible to increase tolerance/robustness to pesticide exposure by providing sensitive individuals with probiotics that have select degradation pathways. Moreover, this understanding is important in order to formulate novel preventive strategies including educating health practitioners, families, and public health providers and organizations regarding the potential risks of environmental exposures. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chemical and toxic substances, such as herbicides and pesticides pose some of the most common threats to environmental and human health. Our studies are designed to identify effects of prenatal pesticide exposure on child neurodevelopment and the role of the gut microbiome in mediating pesticide-induced adverse health effects. Findings of our study will ultimately result in precision risk assessment and precision prevention strategies to improve human health worldwide.",Role of the gut microbiome in pesticide-induced effects on child neurodevelopment,9879567,R01ES031322,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', '4 year old', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrazine', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Degradation Pathway', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diet', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Family health status', 'Food Supply', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Herbicides', 'Human', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Insecticides', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Paraquat', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pentachlorophenol', 'Performance', 'Pesticides', 'Phenotype', 'Phorate', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Poison', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevention strategy', 'Probiotics', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Serum', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Water Supply', 'acaricide', 'biological systems', 'body system', 'brain tissue', 'carcinogenesis', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'drinking water', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'glyphosate', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'health organization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'individualized prevention', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome components', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome sequencing', 'motor behavior', 'mouse model', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pesticide exposure', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal environmental exposure', 'prenatal exposure', 'recruit', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'sample collection', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2020,282150,0.08423841183241577
"Longitudinal Study of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Markers of Tourette Syndrome in Children PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic tic disorders (referred to here as Tourette syndrome: TS) are complex and often serious neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by motor and/or vocal tics. Tics are brief, repetitive, unwanted movements or noises, which can severely impinge upon quality of life. While TS was once thought to be relatively rare, recent epidemiological studies find that 1-6% of all children meet criteria for a chronic tic disorder, making it a significant public health problem. Typically in TS, tics begin around age 5-7 years old, peak in severity around age 10-12 years, and improve throughout adolescence into adulthood. However, not all patients show this improvement during adolescence, as ~30% continue to experience significant impairment into adulthood. Thus, the years during and immediately following peak symptom severity represent a critical time for TS, during which individuals may show considerable improvement or not. Surprisingly little research has targeted this critical developmental stage of TS. Moreover, longitudinal investigations of predictors of TS outcome have focused primarily on single variables (e.g., caudate nucleus volume or tic severity). Yet there is considerable evidence that the neurobiology of TS is quite complex, involving interactions within and between multiple brain networks. For example, our preliminary findings demonstrate stronger brain functional connectivity among cognitive control networks and motor networks, as well as altered white and gray matter volumes in prefrontal and subcortical regions in TS. Using this complex information may be more informative for understanding tic severity changes and predicting clinical outcome. We propose a longitudinal study in which we will capture the developmental stage of TS with the greatest likelihood of change in tic severity (beginning at age 10-12 years), and will follow these children to track the development of brain and cognitive features, and how they relate to symptom change, over time. To capture the complex neurobiology of TS, we will collect whole-brain resting state functional connectivity, structural MRI, cognitive, and clinical data from a group of children with TS. We will compare these children to tic-free controls (from the NIH's ABCD Study Washington University site subject pool), as comparison to typical development will be essential for interpreting longitudinal changes in TS. We will target diagnostic differences and developmental changes in specific functional brain networks, regional brain volumes, and cognitive abilities. We will also use multivariate machine learning methods to unify this rich dataset to classify and make predictions about individual children. This approach analyzes complex patterns of multidimensional data rather than single variables, providing the potential for clinical utility and to contribute converging evidence about mechanism. Identifying mechanisms underlying symptom change will provide insight into why many children with TS improve while some do not, potentially yielding new targets for treatment and predictive indicators of persistent tics. Markers of symptom improvement could be targeted to treat children who do not improve. Being able to make predictions about individual children could identify those children who need those interventions most. We have expertise with every step of the proposed study, but the application to longitudinal data over the first half of the second decade of life is novel. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with Tourette syndrome (TS) follow varying clinical courses, as some will experience substantial improvement over the course of adolescence while others will continue to experience significant impairment. Understanding the brain and cognitive features that mediate or predict different outcomes could revolutionize prognosis and treatment. This project will study children with and without TS over time, during the key ages of 10 to 14 years, to (1) investigate how brain and cognitive markers of TS develop over adolescence and relate to changes in symptom severity, and (2) make predictions about future symptom severity for individual children.",Longitudinal Study of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Markers of Tourette Syndrome in Children,9991926,R01MH118217,"['12 year old', '7 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Tics', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocal Tics', 'Washington', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain volume', 'caudate nucleus', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'mind control', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'putamen', 'symptomatic improvement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,728957,0.02587016534207975
"Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal and postnatal childhood exposure to metals, essential and non-essential, is ubiquitous via dietary and environmental sources. Heavy metals, including lead and methylmercury, are well characterized as potent neurotoxicants, associated with lower cognition and poor learning abilities. Yet, our understanding of the neurotoxicity and joint impact of many other common prenatal and postnatal metal exposures remains extremely limited. Even less is known about the combined impact of exposure to multiple metals during fetal development or postnatal exposure during early childhood, or the influence of other environmental mixtures such as nutrients, which may have shared sources, on the neurodevelopmental effects of metals. To address this significant gap, our long-term goal is to quantify the neurocognitive impact of ubiquitous prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and identify cord blood DNA methylation biomarkers that can reconstruct prenatal environmental exposures and predict future neurocognitive development in children. We will test if objective measures of key prenatal maternal nutrients, such as folate, vitamin B12 and essential metals attenuate or mitigate the neurotoxicity of metal mixtures. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage resources from an established U.S. pre-birth cohort, Project Viva. In this cohort, we have measured concentrations for 14 prenatal maternal metals in the first trimester of pregnancy and blood samples collected in early-childhood (~3 years) ready for metal testing as well as ready to use genome-wide cord blood DNA methylation screens. Children have been followed prospectively and undergone detail testing for neurodevelopment in early (~3 years of age) and mid-childhood (~7 years). We hypothesize that prenatal maternal 1st trimester and postnatal early childhood neurotoxic metal mixtures are associated with poor neurodevelopment in early and mid-childhood (Aim 1), and that prenatal first trimester maternal plasma folate, vitamin B12 and blood concentration of essential metals protect against prenatal metal mixture neurotoxicity (Aim 2). We also hypothesize that DNA methylation marks measured in umbilical cord blood at birth can reconstruct prenatal exposure to metals (Aim 3.a) and that cord blood DNAm marks predict future neurocognitive development in early and mid-childhood (Aim 3.b). By testing longitudinal associations in a large cohort of children with detail cognitive assessments as well as objective biomarkers of metals and nutrients, we will overcome limitations currently faced by existing studies testing few exposures simultaneously. We will use novel statistical methodology to model prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and machine learning algorithms to build epigenetic predictors of exposure and neurodevelopment. This research will provide a comprehensive quantification of the cognitive burden of prenatal and postnatal mixtures, the development of biomarkers of exposure and neurodevelopment and the identification of potential prenatal nutritional intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood decrements in neurocognitive development result in large population burden and expenditure. The proposed research will identify the extent to which prenatal and postnatal neurotoxic mixtures as well as key prenatal nutrients jointly influence neurocognitive development in childhood. This research will provide early life biomarkers that reconstruct prenatal exposures and predict childhood neurocognitive performance with the goal of developing novel and early-life interventions to protect children.",Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers,9882859,R01ES031259,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood specimen', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Neurotoxicity', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Consequentialism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expenditure', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Folic Acid', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vitamin B 12', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'biomarker development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive load', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'early childhood', 'exposed human population', 'genome-wide', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'learning ability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'methylation biomarker', 'neurocognitive test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurodevelopmental effect', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal environmental exposure', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'routine screening', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,438331,0.03658644739831239
"Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development Project Summary/Abstract Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include multiple classes of chemicals that have been used extensively in consumer products. Mounting evidence from toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest EDCs are developmental neurotoxicants, and EDC exposure during the critical in utero period is associated with adverse child cognitive development. Unfortunately, current research focuses on individual EDCs and largely ignores joint and interactive effects of EDCs and the overall effect of the EDC mixture. To assess exposure to multiple EDCs simultaneously, one must consider the high dimensionality of the exposure matrix and the complex correlation structures across chemicals in statistical analyses. To address limitations of existing methods, we propose to adapt a robust technique that is well-established for pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We specifically aim to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a type of robust Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization, to determine the patterns of exposure to four ubiquitous classes of EDCs known to cross the placenta—polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols (e.g., bisphenol A), and phthalates—and to characterize the relationship between these exposure patterns and cognitive development. LDA is empirically-driven so that the researcher does not need to specify a priori the number of patterns, and the non-negativity constraint enhances the interpretability of the patterns identified. For our health model, we will use a supervised approach that allows child cognitive scores to inform the LDA solution, thereby enabling identification of patterns most relevant to the outcome. We will conduct this work using the existing infrastructure of the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study, a longitudinal birth cohort of mother-child dyads. We will also establish reproducibility of the method by creating a user-friendly R package so that other researchers can easily apply LDA in environmental epidemiology, and we will verify transferability and functionality of the method on a separate cohort. This will be the first study to assess the interacting and overall effects of multiple EDCs on child cognitive development, introducing LDA as a straight-forward tool for the analysis of complex mixtures in epidemiology. If successful, this method has broader implications for environmental epidemiology, as it can easily be applied to other environmental mixtures of interest. The activities encompassed by this proposal (study design, data management, advanced statistics, machine learning, data science, and presentation of findings) cover the set of fundamental research skills required by a scientist entering the interdisciplinary field of environmental epidemiology in the era of Big Data and Precision Public Health. The applied experience gained from carrying out this research, in combination with didactic training and individual cross-disciplinary mentoring, comprises a comprehensive research training plan that will serve as a platform from which to launch a career as an independent investigator in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative This study will be the first to determine existing patterns of cross-class endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure in utero and to evaluate their association with child cognitive development, assessing potentially non- linear independent effects, non-additive interactions, and the overall effect of the mixture. This will help to identify environmental risk factors most amenable to public health interventions and inform future researchers and policy makers about concurrent exposure to EDCs in a vulnerable population The adaptation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for pattern identification and dimension reduction in environmental epidemiology integrates data science and machine learning into environmental health research, which is novel and extremely relevant to public health, as LDA can be easily applied to other environmental mixtures and co-exposures of interest.",Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development,9893708,F31ES030263,"['Address', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cosmetics', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Flame Retardants', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Paint', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenols', 'Placenta', 'Plastics', 'Policy Maker', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Urine', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'bisphenol A', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'consumer product', 'data management', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fundamental research', 'health of the mother', 'high dimensionality', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'modifiable risk', 'multiple datasets', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'pollutant', 'polybrominated diphenyl ether', 'prenatal exposure', 'public health intervention', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2020,32095,0.06149850376155323
"The Impact of Air Pollution Exposure on COVID-19 Severity and Mortality PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently the most emergent public health disaster of the entire world. COVID-19 disproportionately affects older adults, people having history of smoking and comorbidities like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. There is no vaccine and treatment for COVID-19, therefore, public health interventions have been taken to control disease transmission. Also, searching modifiable environmental factors that can help reduce the COVID-19 severity and mortality is crucial. Air pollution exposure has been shown to have a systemic effect on the human body including lung function impairment and immune alterations. Recent two ecologic studies from Europe and the United States have suggested that higher long-term ambient air pollution exposure (PM2.5 and NO2) significantly contributes to the COVID-19 mortality. These findings from aggregated data of air pollution exposure and total number of deaths in large geographic areas need to be further verified by cohort study with individual data of air pollution exposure and COVID-19 case progression and mortality. Also, susceptibility factors such as low social economic status (SES), race/ethnicity, smoking exposures and comorbidities need to be accounted for in the analysis. To address the urgent public health question about the role of air pollution exposure in COVID-19 progression, we propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study based on the existing EMR data of all COVID- 19 cases (n>7000) diagnosed at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) medical centers. Specific aims of this proposal have been expanded from our ongoing NIEHS-supported R01 study investigating prenatal air pollution exposure and children's autism risk among 440,000 KPSC mother-child pairs (APAR study, 1R01ES029963). In this proposal, the main outcomes of interest are COVID-19 severity assessed by hospitalization, ICU admission and ventilator use, as well as death. Details dates will be available through EMR. Natural language processing technologies will be applied to identify the date of first COVID-19 symptom onset for each case. Thereafter, the earliest date among COVID-19 symptom onset and clinical diagnosis will be used as the study entry date. Then short- and long-term air pollution exposure will be estimated for each case by averaging air pollution exposure levels during one-month and one-year before the study entry date. Both ambient (PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3) and traffic-related (line dispersion model estimated NOx) air pollution exposure will be assessed based on individual residential addresses. Detailed residential history of all KPSC members have been well-maintained by the KPSC system. Key covariates including age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking exposure, body mass index, comorbidities, medication use, and meteorological data will be extracted to control for confounding and identify susceptible high risk subgroups. With the unique cohort data resource and world-renowned epidemiologists and exposure scientists, this one-year study will greatly enhance our knowledge about the effect of air pollution exposure on COVID-19 progression and death. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study is proposed in response to the urgent need of large cohort studies investigating the contributions of environment such as air pollution exposure to the COVID-19 epidemic and mortality.

"Automated point-of-care identification of innocent Still's murmur in children PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of the proposed research and technology transfer effort is to develop a low-cost, point-of-care, mobile device-based technology for automated identification of Still's murmur, the most common innocent (benign and harmless) heart murmur of childhood. This novel technology could reduce the current rate of over half a million children unnecessarily referred to pediatric cardiologists by primary care providers each year in the United States. In Phase I, AusculTech Dx and Children's National Medical Center developed a machine-learning algorithm capable of identifying Still's murmur with high accuracy (90% sensitivity, 99% specificity). To enable digital recording, essential for computerized murmur analysis, we also developed a digital stethoscope that connects to a smartphone and is equivalent in performance to a commercial stethoscope. Our envisioned product, called StethAid, is a combination of this novel digital stethoscope and a smartphone application (app). Having successfully met the Phase I performance milestones, we now propose to fully develop StethAid and conduct a multicenter trial through the following three specific aims: (1) develop and test a clinical-grade digital stethoscope, (2) develop fully feature software app, (3) conduct a multicenter trial of automated Still's murmur identification. For the multicenter trial, we have expanded our collaboration to include Boston Children's Hospital and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Our deliverable for Phase II is a technology platform validated by leading pediatric cardiologists that is ready for seeking regulatory approvals, deployment at PCP offices, and commercialization. As a decision support system, StethAid could empower PCPs to identify Still's murmur accurately and thus reduce the huge number of unnecessary specialist referrals. This should save the healthcare system hundreds of millions of dollars annually, allow pediatric cardiologists to focus on patients with serious conditions, and protect healthy children and their families from the unnecessary anxiety, inconvenience, and expense of seeing a pediatric cardiologist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over half a million children are referred unnecessarily to pediatric cardiologists by general physicians for the evaluation of Still's murmur, a normal and harmless heart murmur. This project will develop and clinically validate a novel mobile technology for automated recognition of this murmur in order to reduce the current rate of such unnecessary referrals and associated costs and inconvenience.",Automated point-of-care identification of innocent Still's murmur in children,9903425,R42HL131081,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Apple', 'Benign', 'Bluetooth', 'Boston', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Sounds', 'Heart murmur', 'Incidence', 'Legal patent', 'Libraries', 'Medical center', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Stethoscopes', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical center', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pediatric cardiologist', 'performance tests', 'point of care', 'prototype', 'smartphone Application', 'sound', 'tool', 'wasting', 'web interface']",NHLBI,"AUSCULTECH DX, LLC",R42,2020,708937,0.010639336637405081
"Computational Models for the Prediction and Prevention of Child Traumatic Stress - Resubmission - 1 Project Summary/Abstract At least 40% of children will experience a traumatic event. Of those who experience a trauma, 15-40% will develop Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and other adverse psychiatric, health, and functional outcomes (herein called Child Traumatic Stress - CTS). Despite decades of research on risk factors for CTS, the field has not arrived at specific risk factor models that can accurately predict the likelihood of CTS outcomes or identify factors that – if changed – would change their likelihood. Knowledge about changes in factors that result in changes in outcomes is, by definition, causal. The vast majority of findings in the literature on risk for CTS cannot provide such causal knowledge because such findings were based on the application of correlational methods to observational data. Experimental research cannot – for all practical purposes - be conducted for human research on risk for CTS. Thus, the field is left with correlational observational research as the near exclusive generator of empirical knowledge on risk for CTS, and such knowledge is unsuitable to guide the actions (i.e. interventions) that must be taken to change children's likelihood of acquiring CTS outcomes. We propose to address this considerable barrier to progress by applying methods that can enable confident causal inference with large observational data sets containing a broad diversity of risk variables for CTS. Machine Learning (ML) predictive and causal modeling methods will be applied to discover causal relationships among measured variables from observational data: and from such determined causal relationships, to estimate the effect on a CTS outcome when a causal variable is manipulated (i.e. intervention simulation). We will build models for outcomes associated with childhood trauma in the literature and that entail significant burden to children's well-being, functioning, and development: PTSD, Depression, Substance Abuse, Health, and Educational Performance. Project Narrative This application proposes research to apply an array of powerful and innovative computational methods – well validated in other fields – to advance the capacity to predict and prevent traumatic stress in children and adolescents. These methods will be applied to several highly relevant, existing data sets that cover diverse populations of traumatized youth and with diverse data collection designs. The data sets and the analytic methodologies have been carefully selected to advance knowledge related to prediction, discovery of causal mechanisms, and the identification of promising preventative interventions for child traumatic stress.",Computational Models for the Prediction and Prevention of Child Traumatic Stress - Resubmission - 1,10021724,R01MH119114,"['18 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Child Welfare', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Youth', 'base', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'social', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'traumatic stress', 'traumatized children']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,613498,0.016110771009354586
"Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use across different clinical centers; (2) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post- surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a multi-center study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 focus on relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology, developed at Texas Children's Hospital, which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor,9996775,R01HL142994,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Common Ventricle', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Ventricle', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infant', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Surgery', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Surgical complication', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical center', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'news', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'respiratory', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,574855,0.0532666504978352
"Identifying Coronavirus B-cell Epitopes Associated with COVID-19 Illness Severity Identifying Coronavirus B-cell Epitopes Associated with COVID-19 Infection and Illness The new coronavirus outbreak that begin in December 2019 has created a global public health emergency. This has led to an intense search to identify factors that contribute to the susceptibility and severity of illness. We recently developed an array to identify antibody-binding epitopes for rhinoviruses. Data from these arrays can be combined with information about viral protein structure to identify highly immunogenic regions for respiratory viruses. We propose to expand this array to include linear epitopes that represent the entire proteome of SARS- CoV-2 and all other common coronaviruses that infect humans (OC43, NL63, etc.). The study population will include children from the COAST, WISC and URECA birth cohort studies who are also participating in the HEROS SARS-CoV-2 surveillance study. As part of routine cohort activities, these children undergo serial sampling of blood and nasal secretions that we can analyze using the array to determine individual patterns of antiviral antibody epitope recognition. We hypothesize that the pattern and quantity of antibody specific for epitopes of common coronaviruses contributes to the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and illness. We propose three specific aims that will utilize sera obtained from children before and after HEROS-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2. First, in specimens obtained pre-infection we will use the array to identify patterns of antibody epitope recognition to common childhood coronaviruses, assess cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2, and determine whether cross-reactivity is associated with protection against infection or illness. In the second aim, we will determine whether the diversity of antibody responses to common respiratory viruses is associated with a reduced risk of infection or illness. Finally, in the third aim we will describe antibody binding patterns before and after known COVID-19 cases to identify candidate regions that are immunogenic and neutralizing. To accomplish this aim, we will perform micro-neutralization assays (available in the BSL3 laboratory of Dr. Kristen Bernard, UW Madison) on convalescent sera or nasal secretions from children who developed symptomatic infection. This information will be analyzed together with pre- and post-infection array data using machine learning approaches to identify neutralizing epitopes. Identifying patterns of serologic responses that are cross- protective could help to identify susceptible individuals in the population and direct the design of vaccines to current and future viruses. PROJECT NARRATIVE (from parent grant) The morbidity and cost to society from childhood viral respiratory illnesses (VRI) is staggering, and allergic respiratory disease is rampant. In the search for prevention for these common and high-burden diseases, perhaps the solutions are on the farm. Our main hypothesis is that microbes in farming environments promote immune development in early life, and thereby reduce the severity of VRI and protect against allergies. We will test this hypothesis by expanding studies in the Wisconsin Infant Study Cohort (WISC), a birth cohort in dairy farm country consisting of children and their families who were enrolled before birth and then monitored for farm exposures, development of the immune system, respiratory illnesses and allergies. We hope to identify farm-related exposures, including microbes, that promote healthy immune development, and ultimately, healthy children. Completion of these studies will lead to development of new strategies for raising children who get fewer respiratory illnesses and avoid developing respiratory allergies.",Identifying Coronavirus B-cell Epitopes Associated with COVID-19 Illness Severity,10170660,U19AI104317,"['2019-nCoV', 'Allergic', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Diversity', 'Antibody Response', 'Asthma', 'B cell repertoire', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Common Epitope', 'Coronavirus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nose', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Proteome', 'Rhinovirus', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Vaccine Design', 'Viral', 'Viral Antibodies', 'Viral Structural Proteins', 'Virus', 'Wisconsin', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'immunogenic', 'infection risk', 'new technology', 'novel coronavirus', 'parent grant', 'public health emergency', 'respiratory', 'respiratory virus', 'response', 'study population', 'surveillance study']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U19,2020,406048,-0.0031789576341807466
"Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design Patients, clinicians, and policymakers often need valid information about the real-world effects of drugs and other exposures for which there have been pronounced time-trends in use. For example, the rapid growth in the use of rofecoxib in the early 2000s and of exogenous testosterone from 2000–2013 was accompanied by an urgent need for knowledge about the cardiovascular effects of those drugs. Randomized trials seldom enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or follow them long enough, to examine associations with rare outcomes. Therefore, non-randomized studies are needed, even though they are susceptible to unmeasured confounding and other forms of bias. To address these limitations of available epidemiologic designs, we recently introduced the trend-in-trend design: a novel, hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic research design that is applicable when there is a prominent trend in the use of the study exposure. Substantial additional development is needed to realize the full public health impact of the trend-in-trend research design. Areas in most need of development include: evaluation of a sequential analysis extension for real-time post-marketing safety surveillance; evaluation of machine learning to specify the trend-in-trend design’s underlying cumulative probability of exposure model; evaluation of dose-response relationships; and evaluation of treatment effect heterogeneity based on baseline patient characteristics. For each of these methodologic needs, we propose an approach for which we will: 1) assess its statistical properties, in particular large-sample validity through asymptotics and finite sample statistical power; 2) evaluate its performance in thorough simulation studies; and 3) proof-test the approach using the known association between rofecoxib-acute myocardial infarction in healthcare data. Finally, we will apply these developments to the unresolved and highly important question of the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic effects of exogenous testosterone in men. This study will have broad scientific, clinical, and public health impact by greatly extending the utility of a novel epidemiologic research design with demonstrated validity and is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. It will also evaluate the safety of exogenous testosterone, a question of tremendous clinical and public health importance. Examining the safety of prescription drugs is one enormously important application of this design that has the potential to benefit many millions of people. As the trend-in-trend design is also applicable to non-drug exposures that have a pronounced time-trend (e.g., medical procedures, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, etc.), its potential impact on the population is even broader. This project will enhance the utility of the trend-in-trend research design, a novel hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic design that is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. Further, we will leverage these methods developments to study the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic safety of exogenous testosterone, unanswered questions of tremendous clinical and public health importance for older adult males.",Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design,10017817,R01AG064589,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Calendar', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Research Design', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Observational Study', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Research Design', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'To specify', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'base', 'cerebrovascular', 'cohort', 'cyclooxygenase 2', 'design', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'male', 'men', 'method development', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'population health', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'time use', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'trend analysis', 'venous thromboembolism']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,549226,0.004257986999708175
"The role of the oral microbiome in disparities in dental caries and responsiveness to caries prevention Project Summary This project proposes to leverage innovative data collected as part of a large, ongoing, cluster randomized trial of therapies to arrest and prevent dental caries in low-income, minority children to (1) investigate the potential microbial determinants of oral health inequities across racial/ethnic children and (2) explore the degree of susceptibility and responsiveness to conventional therapeutic interventions for caries. Over the past ten years, we have conducted multiple studies on the effectiveness and feasibility of preventive treatments for dental caries applied in pragmatic settings across the United States. In each study, an average of 30% of children was observed to have untreated decay at baseline, a prevalence which was consistently higher amongst minority children. Following receipt of therapeutic interventions for caries prevention and observed longitudinally, some children stayed caries free (responders) while others experienced new incidence of tooth decay (non-responders). This phenomenon of resistance and susceptibility to caries occurred in children with or without prior caries experience, was found amongst children living in both fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities, and was not related to sex or age. In total, re-occurrence of dental caries following preventive therapies was observed in approximately 15% of children regardless of prior caries. Our intention is to study these phenomena. We propose to collect new data from the oral microbiome in a cohort of children receiving biannual silver diamine fluoride (SDF) for dental caries, as well as data on key confounders including dietary intake and oral hygiene behavior. This new data will be linked to data collected from clinical examinations and participant demographics. Children identified for this study will be participants in the referenced clinical trial. Uncovering the role of the microbiome in health disparities could enhance our understanding of why some populations have poorer success rates, greater severity of disease, or overall elevated disease risks compared to others. Our primary goals are to (1) utilize microbiome sequence analysis and taxonomic assignment to identify the potential microbiota and metabolites of caries that exist within different racial/ethnic groups with and without untreated caries, (2) compare the distribution of these microbiota prior to and following receipt of silver diamine fluoride to arrest and prevent caries, and (3) develop a predictive model of responsiveness to SDF using artificial neural networks and LASSO/elastic nets. This will be the first study to longitudinally examine the microbial determinants of innate caries susceptibility and resistance to traditional preventive therapies. Results may improve the precision, targeting, and impact of caries prevention programs. Project Narrative This project focuses on (1) the microbiota determinants of oral health inequities in US children and (2) the degree of susceptibility and responsiveness to conventional therapeutic interventions to arrest and prevent dental caries. Using data from an ongoing, large scale, cluster randomized trial of preventive therapies for caries, we will collect additional data from the oral microbiome to explore disparities in untreated caries across racial/ethnic groups, compare the distribution of relevant microbiota and their metabolites in children with and without caries before and after receipt of silver diamine fluoride, and generate a predictive model to predict whether children are more or less susceptible to the effects of traditional preventive therapies.

"Cardiovascular health and exposure to PM2.5 constituents: a multi-cohort study Project Summary Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the primary cause of death and a major cause of years of life lost in the US and in the world. Cohort studies conducted in North America and Europe have provided crucial information in identifying exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) as a cause of increased CVD risks. They have also pointed out important directions for future research, including the differential toxicity of PM2.5 chemical constituents to CVD incidence, the shape of concentration-response (C-R) functions, impact of exposure time windows and indoor air pollution exposure. The objectives of our study are to assess the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and incident CVD, and investigate the impact of exposure time window and indoor air pollution on these associations. Approach. We will conduct a retrospective multi-cohort study in China using personal health records from five national cohorts with adjudicated CVD endpoints maintained by the Fuwai Hospital. To provide individual-level exposure trajectories for ~120,000 cohort participants during their follow-up period, we will develop an ensemble machine learning model using ground air quality measurements, satellite data, and air quality model simulations to generate 1 km resolution national PM2.5 mass and major constituent (sulfates, nitrates, elemental carbon, organic carbon, lead, and nickel) exposure estimates between 1998 and 2020 (Aim 1). Using cohort data from 2007 to 2020 for our main analyses, we will use Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the associations of long-term exposures to PM2.5 constituents and adverse cardiovascular outcomes including total CVD, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke (Aim 2). Variations of this model will be used to investigate the shape of the C-R functions (linear vs. non-linear) as well as the impact of exposure errors using exposure estimates between 1998 and 2020 (Aim 2a). We will also examine windows of susceptibility for CVD endpoints using both time-variant and time- invariant exposure metrics (Aim 2b). Finally, we will evaluate the confounding effect of indoor air pollution on the C-R functions using a sub-cohort with estimated personal PM2.5 exposure estimates based on Fuwai Hospital's ongoing Multi-Region Panel Study (Aim 2c). Expected Results. Given the tremendous variability in PM2.5 constituent concentrations in China over time and space, our findings will contribute new PM2.5 constituent-specific C-R functions in CVD burden calculation in both the US and the world. Our study will also expand our knowledge on important factors affecting these associations such as exposure window and indoor air pollution. Narrative This study will assess the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in a retrospective multi-cohort study. Usinig five national cohorts and multi-city indoor air pollution measurements in China, we will investigate the shape of the CVD concentration-response functions and the impacts of indoor air pollution and exposure windows. The findings of this study will provide additional scientific support for designing effective policy and public health actions to lower the CVD burden in both the US and China.",Cardiovascular health and exposure to PM2.5 constituents: a multi-cohort study,10034502,R01ES032140,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Caliber', 'Carbon', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Cities', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Concentration measurement', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Outcome', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Heavy Metals', 'Hospitals', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Indoor Air Pollution', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meteorology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nickel', 'Nitrates', 'North America', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Particulate Matter', 'Personal Health Records', 'Policies', 'Pollution', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Shapes', 'Stroke', 'Sulfate', 'Supercomputing', 'Tennessee', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urbanization', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'ambient air pollution', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'fine particles', 'follow-up', 'insight', 'land use', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'particle', 'response', 'study population', 'years of life lost']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,615182,0.01738617694771643
"Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status Abstract Exposures to extreme events are increasingly common in many parts of the globe as a function of changes in weather patterns combined with rising sea levels, but there is a paucity of data to support scientific research on the implications of such exposures for population health and well-being over the long-term. STAR, the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, is a unique exception. We have interviewed respondents from 10 months before the December 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami for 10 years. This project will follow up the same respondents 15 years after the tsunami. The pre-tsunami baseline is a population-representative survey of 27,000 individuals who were living along the coast of Aceh and North Sumatra, Indonesia. The tsunami constitutes a large-scale, unanticipated natural disaster in an area that was not thought to be prone to tsunamis. Moreover, its impacts were spatially idiosyncratic across the study area. Whether a particular community was inundated by the waves depended on a combination of the wave direction, seabed and shoreline topography. Of 368 baseline communities, about a fifth were devastated, a third were somewhat damaged and the rest were not directly affected. These features of the natural experiment provide the basis for identifying causal impacts of this major natural disaster which killed 170,000 people in the study area. The baseline and six post-tsunami waves collected during the prior phase of this project provide detailed information about exposure to and experience of the disaster and the evolution of health and wellbeing, broadly defined, for baseline respondents who survived the tsunami plus new household members. In each follow-up, we have interviewed 95% of all baseline survivors. In this continuation we will re-interview all baseline survivors and their household members fifteen years after the tsunami. We will place these data in the public domain, adding to prior waves of STAR already in the public domain to create an unparalleled data resource for the scientific community. Focusing on those who were exposed to the tsunami as children (age <12y and in utero at the time), we will investigate the impacts of tsunami exposure on the evolution of health, education and cognitive performance, linking outcomes to changes in material and psycho-social resources at the family level as well as community level resources. The latter will be measured combining administrative data and information extracted from satellite imagery using machine learning. Longer-term impacts, fifteen years after the tsunami, will exploit innovative human capital measures including biomarkers, executive function and emotional reactivity. Loss of one or both parents is among the most extreme exposures.

"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate. In this application, we propose to develop and assess the validity of an in-home objective, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system, called FLASH that has the potential to revolutionize the measurement of screen use behaviors.",Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH,9906897,R01DK113269,"['10 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'Asses', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral outcome', 'college', 'computational platform', 'cost', 'diaries', 'field study', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity development', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'privacy preservation', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'tv watching', 'validation studies']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,505658,-0.013192053188452357
"Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia Reading instruction prompts the emergence of neural circuits that are specialized for rapidly translating printed symbols into sound and meaning. Understanding how these circuits differ in children with dyslexia, and change with learning, is an important scientific challenge that holds practical implications for education. The proposed research employs longitudinal measurements in children with dyslexia over the course of a highly effective intervention program to: (a) determine how brain structure and function change in response to reading instruction; and (b) investigate neurobiological factors that predispose a child to struggle or succeed in the intervention. Thus, this proposal seeks to determine both how education shapes brain development, and how a child’s unique neurobiology predicts educational outcomes. Aim 1) White matter plasticity and learning – White matter was previously considered static infrastructure; it is now known that many cellular properties of the white matter change with learning. Reading interventions provide a powerful tool to study experience-dependent plasticity in the human brain. Based on novel quantitative MRI and diffusion MRI measurements developed by the PI and collaborators, it is now possible to quantify changes in cell density, intra-axonal water and myelination at millimeter resolution. Longitudinal measurements collected before, during, and after the intervention will be used to model the time-course of white matter plasticity associated with improvements in reading skills, and investigate the biological mechanisms that underlie differences in learning among children. Aim 2) Bottom-up and top-down computations in the reading circuit - When our eyes fixate upon a word, a cascade of neural processes is initiated, beginning in the visual system and progressing through a series of computations that translate the visual representation into sound and meaning. We have developed the first model of the neural computations performed by critical components of the brain’s reading circuitry. Based on this new understanding of computations in the literate adult brain, we will investigate how computations differ in children with dyslexia, and change in response to reading instruction. Aim 3) Neural biomarkers of learning outcomes - Even in a controlled and intensive learning environment, some children show substantial improvements in reading skill, while others show limited change. What biological factors predispose a child to excel or struggle when provided a high-quality intervention? Pre- intervention MRI measurements will be examined as predictor variables for individual differences in intervention learning rate, and long-term, post-intervention outcomes. Aim 3 will capitalize machine learning to develop a model of the neuroanatomical factors that predict learning outcomes. Dyslexia, an impairment in accurate or fluent word recognition, is the most common learning disability affecting roughly ten percent of children. This proposal capitalizes on cutting edge neuroimaging methods, in combination with carefully controlled educational interventions and behavioral measurements, to generate a new understanding of how successful intervention shapes the development of the brain circuits that support skilled reading. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms of successful remediation of dyslexia, and individual differences in learning, will pave the way for personalized approaches to dyslexia treatment.",Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia,10013256,R01HD095861,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cell Density', 'Child', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Eye', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Myelin Sheath', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Water', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain remodeling', 'brain shape', 'cognitive task', 'density', 'educational atmosphere', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'intervention program', 'learning outcome', 'literate', 'millimeter', 'mouse model', 'myelination', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'phonology', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'successful intervention', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,531494,0.01274637037744899
"Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease Project Summary Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 2.4 billion episodes of illness and 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in adults, adolescents, and children over five years. As the severity of diarrheal diseases can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While patients with severe dehydration require hospital admission and immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, those with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated in outpatient settings with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution. Yet, while several tools have been validated for use in children under five years of age, no clinical diagnostic tool has ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Differences in both adult physiology and diarrhea etiology may compromise the accuracy of clinical diagnostic models developed for use in young children. The proposed research will derive the very first age-specific clinical diagnostic models created for the assessment of dehydration status in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea, incorporate those models into a new mobile health (mHealth) tool, and validate the performance of this tool in a new population of patients with acute diarrhea. To accomplish this task, we will enroll a prospective cohort of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea presenting to the rehydration unit of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Dhaka, Bangladesh and collect data on presenting clinical signs and symptoms shown to correlate with dehydration severity in prior studies. We will then employ machine learning techniques to derive age-specific clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea. We will conduct formative research among clinicians working at icddr,b to develop an innovative mobile phone based platform which will incorporate these new age-specific diagnostic models for rapid use by frontline health workers. Finally, we will validate both the accuracy and reliability of the newly developed mHealth tool in a new population of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Once developed and properly validated, this novel mHealth tool has the potential to help physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers more accurately diagnose dehydration severity and better determine the optimal management strategy for patients with acute diarrhea. Improved diagnostic approaches may in turn be shown to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration. Project Narrative Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases remains a leading cause of death in both children and adults worldwide, yet no clinical tools have ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. The proposed research will both develop and validate an innovative new mobile phone based platform for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents, and older children with acute diarrhea. This new mobile health tool will help physicians, nurses, and other providers worldwide to determine the best management strategies for patients with acute diarrhea, potentially improving and rationalizing care for the hundreds of millions of patients each year presenting to healthcare facilities around the world with acute diarrhea.",Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease,9969419,R01DK116163,"['5 year old', 'Acute Diarrhea', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bangladesh', 'Beds', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'IV Fluid', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'International Unit', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort', 'Provider', 'Rehydration Solutions', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical examination', 'clinical predictors', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diarrheal disease', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'international center', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2020,618136,0.011358681559477325
"Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health Project Summary  Decades of research suggest that neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage increases children's health risk. This proposed project seeks to address two major weaknesses in conventional neighborhood effects research and interventions: a) the assumption that residential neighborhoods function independently of each other - ignoring that risk factors in areas where people work, learn, and play away from home may interact with residential factors; and b) as importantly, insufficient understanding of neighborhood effects mechanisms and heterogeneity in effects. To systematically address these critical barriers in the field, I propose a research and training program that will enable me to learn, use, and adapt recent advancements in Big Data analytics. I plan to model hidden interdependencies among individuals and neighborhoods and operationalize mechanisms of neighborhood effects by drawing on multiple large datasets (demographic, geospatial, networks, population flows), with several hundred million observations across multiple states, cities, and years, and match them to locally and nationally representative restricted survey data. The massive volume, great variety, and unique complexity of such data, such as relational data on inter-neighborhood dependencies and interactions, pose a challenge to the standard capabilities of hardware, algorithms, and analytical methods and models of social and population science. The proposed training program in Big Data analytics and machine learning will enable me to overcome computational and conceptual challenges and uniquely position me to: a) examine the ecological inter-neighborhood networks (econetworks) to which population groups are differentially exposed to across space and time; and b) test new contextual mechanisms underlying children's exposures to health risks. Specifically, I propose to: a) develop computational models of dynamic large scale econetworks to assess population differences in exposures to health risk factors, as they commute daily between home and workplaces; b) examine heterogeneity in econetwork effects on child health using a hybrid design that links Big Data to local and national surveys; and c) model child health risk mechanisms and causal effects using natural experiments on Big Data. The proposed training program will enable me to learn and adapt Big Data analytics, draw on its strengths, but also address some of its key limitations. With the support of a unique team of distinguished mentors and advisors, established experts in Big Data analytics, spatial demography, network analysis, child development and health risk, neighborhood change, and population heterogeneity, I will embark on a training program that will uniquely enable me to address these research goals and position me to become an independent scholar and a leader in the field. Project Narrative This project contributes to advancing public health scholarship by leveraging and adapting Big Data analytical tools to overcome critical barriers in the field related to conventional assumptions about effects of neighborhood risk exposures on child health. It addresses the need to understand and model inter- neighborhood interdependencies and underlying multidimensional social capital mechanisms in order to better understand population heterogeneity in neighborhood effects on child health across space and time. The project also advances public health through an integration of rigorous social and data science methodology to create new measures and test causal hypotheses that advance our understanding of social capital forces that foster resilience to adversity and improve child health behavior and outcomes.",Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health,10003037,K01HD093863,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Businesses', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Child Rearing', 'Cities', 'Collaborations', 'Commuting', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Demography', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Drug usage', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health behavior outcomes', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Surveys', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'Social Work', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress and Coping', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'boys', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'large scale data', 'low socioeconomic status', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'population health', 'programs', 'resilience', 'social capital', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'theories', 'violence exposure']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,K01,2020,137660,0.024586087000802476
"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett). Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop new methods for screening for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It will exploit the wide availability and convenience of smartphone and tablet devices to detect the facial effects in children and adults and new ways of analyzing ultrasound images to detect facial and brain effects in the fetus. Our aim is to establish earlier detection so as to allow earlier intervention to improve outcome.",Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure,9927955,U01AA014809,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', '3D ultrasound', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Fetus', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Neonatal', 'Nose', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pregnancy', 'Preparation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Syndrome', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'age group', 'alcohol exposure', 'algorithm development', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'caudate nucleus', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'handheld equipment', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse model', 'neonatal period', 'novel', 'operation', 'postnatal', 'potential biomarker', 'prenatal', 'prenatal testing', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'tobacco exposure']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,U01,2020,234498,-0.03845400073805072
"Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater Project Summary / Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a naturally-occurring metal contaminant found in water supplies throughout the world. Although research using small samples (< 400 observations) from Bangladesh, China and Canada suggests that excessive consumption of Mn is neurotoxic in infants and young children, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) classifies Mn only as a secondary contaminant. Thus, Mn is not subject to mandatory monitoring in public water systems, let alone private wells, which serve over 2 million Californians while remaining unregulated and untreated. To reconcile the gap between epidemiological evidence and regulatory action, we propose this timely research. Our project, which takes California’s private wells as a focal point for its investigation, has three specific aims: to identify (1) areas at high risk of exposure to Mn in drinking water (2) the socioeconomic characteristics of communities at high-risk of Mn exposure, and (3) the degree of association between Mn exposure and the health outcomes of infants and young children. While treatment for Mn-contaminated water is technologically straightforward, access may depend on a community’s socioeconomic and political status; thus, there is danger of Mn silently amplifying health inequalities. The ​broader, long-term objectives of this research are (I) to encourage further analyses of Mn exposure in California by developing a statewide publicly-available dataset from groundwater Mn data, and (II) to develop a ​causal ​framework for a primary-sample study of Mn effects on infant and child health. California enforces the US EPA’s secondary contaminant standard of 50 µg L​-1 but only in community water systems. Non-transient, non-community water systems (e.g. schools and hospitals) and private wells are exempt. In recent years, the US Geological Survey (USGS) has found Mn concentrations above the health-based target of 300 µg L​-1 in California’s wells. ​The proposed research will indicate whether and to what extent Mn affects child health and contributes to health disparities. As such, it is aligned with the NIEHS mission to determine how environmental exposures affect humans in order to promote healthier lives. To achieve the first aim of identifying areas at high risk of exposure to unsafe concentrations of Mn, we will use a machine learning model on subsurface flow and groundwater chemistry to predict Mn concentrations in the Central Valley, Los Angeles, Central Coast and West Coast Basins; then, we will overlay the Mn prediction grid with ZIP code and school district polygons to identify the areas that emerge with more than a 50% chance of exposure to Mn at the secondary standard as high-risk. For the second aim, we will determine if high-risk areas are distinguished from low-risk areas by their socioeconomic status and demographics using two-sample t-tests. For the third aim, we will run least squares regressions of birth weight, grade-by-school test scores and chronic absenteeism rates on predicted Mn exposure with controls for chemical confounds, socioeconomic status and demographic characteristics. Project Narrative The impact of manganese (Mn) on population health is an under-investigated problem in the United States relative to the wide prevalence and frequent detections of the chemical above safe concentrations in groundwater basins throughout the country. In line with NIEHS priorities to better understand environmental health disparities and to aid in securing environmental justice, we propose to correct this knowledge gap by undertaking a substantial investigation into the prevalence of Mn in California’s private wells, and examining the shared characteristics of communities most likely to be exposed to unsafe levels of manganese in drinking water. By also performing a preliminary investigation of the relationship between Mn exposure and child cognitive health, our study will provide an initial assessment of the public health threat from Mn, highlight the most vulnerable communities, and inform regulatory agencies seeking to review drinking water standards for Mn.",Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater,9978510,R21ES030807,"['Absenteeism', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Asia', 'Bangladesh', 'Birth Weight', 'California', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'China', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disadvantaged', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Esthetics', 'Exposure to', 'Geological Survey', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impaired health', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Maps', 'Metals', 'Micronutrients', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Vital Statistics', 'Water', 'Water Supply', 'base', 'contaminated water', 'demographics', 'drinking water', 'econometrics', 'elementary school', 'environmental justice', 'ethnic minority population', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'ground water', 'health disparity', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'infant outcome', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'school district', 'socioeconomics', 'web site']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE,R21,2020,224680,0.05638623830951103
"Timing of prenatal stress and early markers of child psychopathology PROJECT SUMMARY Psychopathology is a very serious public health burden that not only affects adults, but also many children and adolescents. To better understand this devastating problem, the scientific community has focused its efforts on pinpointing the earliest developmental origins of psychopathology. A considerable literature now implicates prenatal stress as a critical determinant of poor psychological functioning in childhood and beyond. However, knowledge about whether the timing of prenatal stress differentially influences the development of child psychopathology is virtually unknown. Gaining such knowledge is the long-term goal of our research. This proposed project “piggybacks” on our current RO1-funded project (NICHD grant # R01HD085990) that is following a cohort of 335 women oversampled for life stress, with data collection starting at pregnancy week 15 until 6 months postpartum. We are conducting a granular assessment of pregnancy stress (measured weekly by maternal report) with the goal of understanding critical periods during fetal life when stress derails later infant behavioral and physiological stress responsivity. The overall objective of this new RO1 project is to follow this cohort into the child's preschool years. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will determine how the differential timing of prenatal stress influences behavior problems and psychopathology measured at age 4, how differences in self-regulation (an important precursor of mental health functioning) mediates the relationship between prenatal stress and psychopathology at age 4, and how these relationships differ between boys and girls. Aim 2 will test a host of postnatal risk factors (e.g., poor maternal mental health, poverty, intimate partner violence) and resilience factors (e.g., sensitive parenting, coping skills) as moderators of the effects of timing of prenatal stress on behavior problems and psychopathology at age 4. Importantly and uniquely, postnatal stress (mother and child) is assessed also in a fine-grained manner by every 3 month assessments from age 6 mos to 4 years. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use an exploratory statistical approach, machine learning, to detect which relatively small epochs of stress in postnatal life (measured every 3 months) interact with small epochs of prenatal stress to maximally influence child behavior problems and psychopathology. This project is innovative in its highly multimethod approach (e.g., behavioral observation, salivary analytes, laboratory tasks), its granular assessment of chronic and episodic prenatal and postnatal stressors, and the novel statistical approaches used to determine which epochs of stress are most relevant for psychopathology. This highly significant research will be the first longitudinal, prospective, multi-method study of how differential timing of prenatal stress influences the development of psychopathology, as mediated by child self-regulation and moderated by postnatal environmental factors. Thus, this study is critical for understanding how early child development sets the stage for psychopathology and will lead to increased understanding of the developmental epochs to be targeted for preventative interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prenatal stress has devastating effects on children's neurobehavioral development, including elevating the risk for mental health disorders. What remains virtually unknown, however, is how the differential timing of prenatal stress affects the risk for later psychopathology, how this risk is mediated by children's capacity to self-regulate, and the role of the postnatal family environment in exacerbating or reducing this risk. The proposed study will provide essential information about how the timing of prenatal stress, child regulatory capacity, and the postnatal environment interact to increase risk for emerging psychopathology, which will inform strategies for developing and implementing interventions to prevent poor mental health and other negative child outcomes.",Timing of prenatal stress and early markers of child psychopathology,10048200,R01HD100469,"['4 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Coping Skills', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Outcome', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Preschool Child', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Salivary', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Stress', 'System', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavior observation', 'biobehavior', 'boys', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'early childhood', 'executive function', 'externalizing behavior', 'fetal', 'girls', 'innovation', 'intimate partner violence', 'maternal stress', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'sex', 'stress reactivity', 'stressor', 'virtual']",NICHD,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,675471,0.040996171960522285
"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining sophisitcated data-analysis methods that use experiential and phenotypic heterogeneity together with longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral assessments in school-age children. This approach will increase precision when linking ECAs and child outcomes associated with the Research Domain Criteria constructs of Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS). The overarching goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the heterogeneous impact of ECAs on neurodevelopmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. This project's premise is that children exposed to ECAs have highly heterogeneous developmental histories as well as heterogeneous outcomes; therefore, prediction of ECA outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-driven approaches will 1) more precisely define NVS/CCS outcomes for school-aged children with ECAs, and 2) provide a more robust explanatory model for links between ECAs and NVS/CCS trajectories. Aim 1A subtypes children with a history of ECAs based on 2.5-year developmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. 300 6-8 year old children (250 sampled from previous institutional and foster care; 50 community comparisons) will provide neuroimaging, behavioral, and self/caregiver reports every 15 months for 2.5 years. Biclustering methods will be applied to the baseline and follow-up data to identify homogeneous NVS/CCS final outcome clusters of children. Aim 1B develops an explanatory model to predict developmental trajectory subtypes for children with ECAs, from early life profiles and brain/behavior phenotypes at the time of enrollment. Machine learning methods applied to early life profiles, baseline NVS/CCS profiles, and sex, will predict developmental trajectory subtypes. Aim 2 identifies adverse and protective life events during the 2.5-year assessment period that are predictive of 2.5-year follow-up outcomes for children with ECAs. The inclusion of child-sex and current life- events will identify potential divergence in pathways across middle childhood. This prospective design of children exposed to various ECAs is designed to develop predictive models for ECA trajectory subtypes and outcomes, which can inform our understanding of risk and protective factors in accord with the goals of precision medicine.   Project Narrative Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology, and it is estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining longitudinal multimodal brain imaging and high- dimensional behavioral assessments in school-age children together with sophisticated data analytic techniques to increase precision when linking heterogeneous ECAs and child outcome with the goal of predicting mental health outcomes and identifying children who would benefit most from specific early interventions.  ",Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities,9964904,R01MH091864,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Orphanages', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain behavior', 'caregiving', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'foster care', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'middle childhood', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prepuberty', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'violence exposure']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2020,698273,0.0635301968414171
"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9967154,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'sociodemographics', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,614537,0.010523182201512713
"Neural mechanisms of risk and resilience in early childhood irritability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Irritability, defined as lowered threshold for anger when experiencing the RDoC construct frustrative non-reward, i.e., failing to receive expected rewards, is one of the most common reasons for pediatric psychiatric evaluation. Our work shows that early detection is critical: If irritability in preschool-age (3-6 years, before 1st grade) continues into school-age (after 1st grade), as it does for approximately 50% of preschool-age irritable children, such persistent irritability puts children on the path to mental disorder across the lifespan. Thus, identifying the neural mechanisms by which children persist vs. remit in irritability is paramount to intervene in the earliest phase of the clinical cascade. Irritability is linked with abnormalities in reward processing, which may lead to greater frustration when rewards are not received. Such reward processing vulnerabilities may be ameliorated by better inhibitory control, which normatively increases with maturation. However, the interplay between reward processing and inhibition in irritability trajectories is unknown. Investigating longitudinal changes in neural circuitry during this developmental period is important because the reward- and inhibition-related neural networks undergo substantial change and may be most malleable to early intervention. Our overall goal is to identify reward- and inhibition-related neural pathways that characterize persistence vs. remission of early childhood irritability. To this end, the proposed project will longitudinally characterize the neural and symptom trajectories of preschool-age children into school-age. We will collect measures of reward- and inhibitory control-related brain function at baseline and 24-month follow-up from 215 5-6-year-old children prior to 1st grade, alongside assessments of child irritability and inhibition at each 6-month follow-up. A comprehensive assessment of child (cognition, temperament, psychopathology), parent (psychopathology) and contextual factors (e.g., parenting, stressors) will also be assessed at baseline and 24-month assessments. Our central hypothesis is that young children with reward- and inhibition-related neural deficits are more likely to persist in irritability compared to those who remit. Specific aims are to identify (1) concurrent contributions of reward- and inhibition-related neural function to irritability at each age (preschool-age, school-age); (2) developmental changes in reward- and inhibition-related neural mechanisms of irritability trajectories from early to middle childhood; (3) early childhood reward- and inhibition-related neural predictors of irritability trajectories and future psychopathology; and (4) the moderating role of child sex, parent psychopathology, parenting, and life stress on these brain-behavior associations. This proposal will advance the field by revealing the neural circuitry of irritability risk and resilience. Innovative aspects include focusing on a key age range (5-6 years) to prevent later disorders, multiple time point imaging, and machine learning methodology. Our project is significant because it will pave the way for precision medicine for irritability: providing the right treatment (based on neural mechanisms) to the right people (children who will persist in irritability), at the right time (preschool age, before irritability problems worsen). PROJECT NARRATIVE Because preschool-age irritability that persists into school-age predicts lifespan mental disorder and poorer functional outcomes, identifying the neural mechanisms by which children persist vs. remit in irritability is paramount to intervene in the earliest phase of the clinical cascade. Our overall goal is to identify reward- and inhibition-related neural pathways that characterize persistence vs. remission of early childhood irritability and may be targets for future novel preventive efforts.

"Effect of complex mixtures on oxidative stress and cognition in children ABSTRACT In many areas of the world, children are regularly exposed to environmental chemicals. During any given period of life, children will experience exposure to many chemicals at the same time. The effects of such mixtures of chemicals on the molecular underpinnings of the disease process, such as oxidative stress (OS) or on functional endpoints such as cognitive functions, are not well understood in children. There is also little understating of the extent to which endogenous antioxidant defenses in children's bodies or exogenous antioxidants buffer the effects of chemical mixtures on children's health. The few studies on this topic to date have been mostly cross-sectional or limited to small numbers of chemicals. To address these gaps, the proposed study will leverage the Salud Ambiental Montevideo (SAM) cohort in Uruguay, which has enrolled 679 1st-grade children between years 2012-19. Currently, children range in age 7-15 years and have been followed-up for 0-5 years, depending on year of enrollment. Exposure to chlorpyrifos and pyrethroids pesticides has been characterized in a sub-sample of children using urinary metabolites of the pesticides. Exposure to metals in this cohort is generally low. In a cross-sectional pilot study of SAM participants, a metal mixture was linked to higher levels of oxidative DNA damage and with lower performance on a test of general cognitive abilities. The proposed study will consist of 3 years of follow-up of SAM children to annually characterize the levels of metals in blood and urine, and metabolites of chlorpyrifos, pyrethroids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in urine. Each year, urinary biomarkers of OS (F2-isoprostane and 8-OHdG), serum antioxidant enzymes (GPx and PON1), and serum antioxidant vitamins (vitamin C, carotenoids, retinol, etc). will be measured. A sub-sample of ~100 children will participate in a year-long intensive (monthly) assessment of OS biomarkers to characterize short-term fluctuations in biomarkers and their biological predictors. Children will complete assessments of executive functions (EF) in Y2 and Y3 of the study. Leveraging data collected at enrollment into SAM (T0, ~7y), chemical mixtures will be constructed in statistical machine learning models for four time points: T0 and Y1-3 of the proposed study. These mixtures will be modeled to understand how exposure to mixtures over time is associated with OS and EF. Potential effect modification by antioxidants will be tested. The proposed activities align with the 2018-23 NIEHS strategic plan of research on the exposome to promote human health through the advancement of environmental health sciences. Specifically, they will: 1) advance the basic understanding of short (1 yr) and medium-term (3 yrs) fluctuations in biomarkers of OS and antioxidant defenses, which have not been investigated in children; 2) contribute to understanding of the extent to which chemical mixtures in early-middle childhood affect a molecular process (OS) thought to underlie the development of chronic disease, as well as functional endpoints that underlie children's learning and social interactions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Throughout their lives, children are exposed to many different chemicals but our understanding of the effects of these mixtures on child health is limited. Our research is relevant to public health: it will inform prevention efforts and communication of risks by creating a deeper understanding of how exposure to chemical mixtures affects oxidative stress and cognition in children and how well the body's antioxidant defenses are able to counteract these effects. Our work is also relevant to the mission of the NIEHS: it will contribute fundamental knowledge on environmental influences on disease.",Effect of complex mixtures on oxidative stress and cognition in children,10072546,R01ES031411,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'All-Trans-Retinol', 'Antioxidants', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Arylesterase', 'Ascorbic Acid', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Buffers', 'Carotenoids', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'F2-Isoprostanes', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Income', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Memory', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Pesticides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Serum', 'Social Interaction', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tocopherols', 'Urine', 'Uruguay', 'Vitamins', 'Work', 'aged', 'antioxidant enzyme', 'aryldialkylphosphatase', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'early adolescence', 'environmental chemical', 'enzyme activity', 'executive function', 'experience', 'first grade', 'follow-up', 'glutathione peroxidase', 'improved functioning', 'individual variation', 'middle childhood', 'oxidative DNA damage', 'pyrethroid', 'response', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'urinary']",NIEHS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2020,580988,0.07343096802848494
"Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) PROJECT SUMMARY Evidence suggests that exposure to Superfund chemicals contributes to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), including preterm birth (PTB). Rates of PTB and infant mortality in Puerto Rico (PR) are among the highest of all US states and territories. There are 18 Superfund sites in PR, and evidence of contamination of the drinking water is extensive. Moreover, extreme weather events (hurricanes, flooding) may result in elevated exposures to Superfund chemicals. The PROTECT center has brought together researchers from Northeastern University, the University of Puerto Rico, University of Georgia, and the University of Michigan to provide much needed understanding of the relationship and the mechanisms by which exposure to suspect chemicals contribute to APOs, and to develop new methods to reduce risk of exposure in PR and beyond. To do this, PROTECT uses a source-to-outcome structure, integrating epidemiological (Project 1), toxicological (Project 2), fate and transport (Project 3), and remediation (Project 4) studies, a unified sampling infrastructure, a centralized indexed data repository, and a sophisticated data management system. Since its inception in 2010, PROTECT has built detailed and extensive data sets on environmental conditions and prenatal conditions of 1457 pregnant mothers (exposure, socioeconomic and health data–close to 3000 data points per participant), yielding a cohort of 1210 live births in northern PR. In the renewal, PROTECT will recruit and follow an additional 1000 study participants, yielding a cohort of 800+ live births for an ultimate total cohort of 2000+ completed live births. PROTECT has documented significant contamination of northern PR drinking water and has found compelling preliminary epidemiologic and mechanistic toxicology associations between Superfund chemicals and APOs. PROTECT research has focused on chlorinated volatile organic compounds and phthalates and their role in PTB. The PROTECT renewal will broaden its scope, employing a data-driven approach to study and reduce the impact of exposure to mixtures of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites in karst regions on APOs in Puerto Rico’s underserved, highly-exposed population. Target chemicals will be expanded to include metals, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We will investigate the impacts of extreme weather events on contaminant transport and exposure, and new water treatment technologies will be developed for portable and robust water treatment systems. The PROTECT renewal will also focus on oxidative stress as an underlying biological pathway by which contaminant exposure can lead to APOs. New statistical methods and data mining, machine learning, and visualization tools will be developed to allow PROTECT researchers to analyze our datasets. PROTECT will employ innovative approaches to engage and educate the community, involve study participants, report- back data, and communicate with stakeholders. A broad suite of training and professional activities will be provided to trainees, individually tailored to the trainees’ needs and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Reproductive health has been at the forefront of Puerto Ricans’ health concerns as rates of preterm birth and infant mortality in Puerto Rico are among the highest of all U.S. states and territories. The PROTECT SRC is exploring the link between exposure to a mixture of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites and adverse pregnancy outcomes in Puerto Rico, and is working to reduce that exposure. Improved understanding of the link between adverse pregnancy outcomes and contamination, together with developing sustainable technologies to reduce risk, will help improve health outcomes in Puerto Rico (a disadvantaged population) and beyond.",Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT),9839906,P42ES017198,"['Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Floods', 'Geographic state', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Hurricane', 'Individual', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infrastructure', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxidative Stress Pathway', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pesticides', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Public Health Practice', 'Puerto Rican', 'Puerto Rico', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Superfund', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visualization software', 'Water', 'Water Purification', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'community involvement', 'contaminant transport', 'contaminated drinking water', 'contaminated water', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'disadvantaged population', 'drinking water', 'experience', 'extreme weather', 'ground water', 'health data', 'human model', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'new technology', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'portability', 'prenatal', 'recruit', 'remediation', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'sound', 'superfund chemical', 'superfund site', 'tissue culture', 'toxicant', 'volatile organic compound', 'water treatment']",NIEHS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,P42,2020,2414074,0.03861930317838593
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9980863,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,682143,0.008551337885397612
"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution health effects on asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome parameters in especially vulnerable minority children populations.",Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework,9894798,R00ES027511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'African American', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'American', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'European', 'Exposure to', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Future', 'GALA', 'Genetic', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Latino', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Puerto Rican', 'Randomized', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'adverse outcome', 'analog', 'base', 'career', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic difference', 'experience', 'exposure pathway', 'health disparity', 'interest', 'minority children', 'pollutant', 'public health intervention', 'pulmonary function', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'social disparities', 'social epidemiology', 'social factors', 'social vulnerability', 'tool']",NIEHS,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,249000,0.005263458999385762
"Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders Project Summary: Early life psychosocial adversity and stress are well-established as the most powerful environmental risk factors for poor neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes in children. Impairments in developing emotion regulation and cognitive control and associated alterations in brain development have been shown to mediate the effects of adversity on risk for the development of psychopathology. Early psychosocial adversity impacts the epigenetic and inflammation-mediated processes that contribute to these negative outcomes, a process known as “biological embedding of stress.” While this risk trajectory has been clearly linked to increased rates of psychopathology, the mechanisms of this process, its targetable mediators and how early in development they operate are yet to be determined. Here we focus on the effects of early life adversity on brain, emotion regulation and cognitive control outcomes relevant to risk for mental disorders, beginning antenatally and extending to age 3. We will examine the role of pre- and postnatal adversity/stress, the maternal and child perinatal gut microbiome and early caregiver support on these key neurodevelopmental outcomes utilizing state-of-the-art neuroimaging. Our unifying hypothesis is that these factors modulate systemic inflammatory responses, induce neuronal effects through this and other processes that adversely impact brain development in limbic and cortical regions, and mediate the effects of early adversity on child emotion regulation, cognitive control and mental health outcomes. These factors will be studied in a unique, prospectively ascertained cohort of 370 mothers and their offspring at high psychosocial risk being recruited as part of an already funded March of Dimes project at Washington University. The cohort will include both term- and prematurely-born infants and toddlers given the increased risk of psychosocial adversity and aberrant gut microbiome in preterm children. The offspring will be intensively prospectively studied from the 1st trimester to age 3, providing a unique dataset in which to examine the interrelationships among pre- and postnatal adversity, biomarkers of inflammation, the gut microbiome and developmental and mental health outcomes. The perinatal and early childhood periods are critical times to study these exposures as adverse neurodevelopment associated with adversity begins in utero through fetal programming. Likewise, the perinatal period is a critical developmental window for microbial influences, when gut microbial colonization has its most enduring effects. The proposed study merges established research groups in these areas in a center with advanced infant and childhood neuroimaging and extensive microbiome expertise, and offers an unprecedented opportunity to understand the mechanisms of the biological embedding of adversity on brain, cognitive and emotional trajectories in a high-risk cohort. We will also apply innovative computational methods, using Deep Learning, to extend understanding of these data. Findings will provide critical and novel insights to inform early preventive interventions relevant to emotional, cognitive and mental health outcomes for children at greatest risk. Project Narrative This study will investigate the mechanisms by which psychosocial adversity experienced in utero and early in life impact the child’s brain, cognitive and emotional development, testing the hypothesis that stress and adversity during pregnancy adversely affect early brain development through inflammatory mechanisms. Another important focus of this project is to examine how the maternal perinatal microbiome and infant’s gut microbiome during early childhood impact brain development, either through the infant’s inflammatory response or other effects. A third focus is to explore the effects of caregiver support on this risk trajectory, testing the idea that high caregiver support reduces the negative influences of early adversity, altered immune biomarkers and disruptions in the gut microbiome.","Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders",9929031,R01MH113883,"['3 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caregiver support', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Funding', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informal Social Control', 'Instruction', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mothers', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Poverty', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'antenatal', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep learning', 'early childhood', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'fetal programming', 'gray matter', 'gut colonization', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'infant gut microbiome', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal microbiome', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiome', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal period', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,2343175,0.030888407402195527
"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9954064,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Buprenorphine', 'Calcarine Sulcus', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methadone', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual attention', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive ability', 'critical period', 'drug of abuse', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal drug exposure', 'fetal opioid exposure', 'illicit opioid', 'imaging modality', 'in utero', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'joint attention', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'motor control', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid use', 'opioid use in pregnancy', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prescription opioid', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'standard of care', 'visual control', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,690910,0.021626876783453663
"Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children Maternal substance use disorders are a substantial public health concern and the neurological consequences of prenatal exposure are a major threat to the long-term health of offspring. Globally, prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is between 2-7 and 20-50 per 1000, respectively. By contrast, in certain high-risk communities in South Africa, prevalence is reported to be as high as 63 and 155 per 1000, respectively. Though prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to affect the central nervous system, to date, little data exists in respect of the impact of PAE in early childhood, before both higher-level brain networks are established and other potentially confounding post- natal environmental influences have come into play. For neurodevelopmental disorders, studies have consistently shown that early intervention, based on detection and targeted interventions, leads to better long-term outcomes. We aim to address this precise gap in knowledge by imaging the brain and 3D face across the FASD continuum to investigate early biomarkers, trajectories and functional correlates of PAE in a cohort followed prospectively from birth to age 6 years. Data: Our cohort includes a well characterized subsample of children (PAE and healthy controls) enrolled in the Drakenstein Child Health Study in Cape Town, South Africa, who have been scanned as neonates and at 2-3 years of age. Preliminary published data shows highly significant relationships between PAE and regional gray and white matter changes, already discernible in newborns, well before the age FASD is typically diagnosed. An additional longitudinal assessment at 6-years will yield a unique FASD sample with 3 distinct time points (infants, toddlers and children), allowing characterization of brain and face morphology and brain structure and function in this previously understudied early developmental period. This proposal addresses fundamental gaps concerning the presence, timing and regional specificity of altered brain morphology and structural and functional connectivity in association with the effects of PAE on the developing brain from birth to 6 years, and the relationships with facial dysmorphology. The research team has successfully gathered data from the proposed cohort as neonates and at 2–3 years of age. The benefits of extending this research to a subsequent imaging time-point, with a larger range of developmental and neurobehavioral assessments, provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine longitudinal effects of PAE on the trajectory of the developing brain in these critical early years, the links between neural and face predictors of PAE and the long-term clinical significance of these findings. This research will illuminate early neurodevelopmental mechanisms leading to subsequent behavioral and neurological disturbances, which may allow opportunities for targeting interventions when brain plasticity is still relatively fluid. This project might also lead to new strategies for early diagnosis using both face and brain biomarkers. Project Narrative Fetal exposure of the brain to alcohol can trigger brain abnormalities that unfold over a lifetime with severe consequences both for the affected individual and for society at large. To date, these brain abnormalities and associated deficits and behaviors have mostly been studied in late childhood or later, with very few studies following the consequences of well documented fetal alcohol exposure as they develop in the same individual across time in early childhood when the brain is most responsive to potential treatments. This project will extend an ongoing study of children with fetal alcohol exposure, already characterized as newborns and at age 2-3 to add assessments of the brain and behavior at age 6 and will explore alcohol-induced facial abnormalities as a complementary predictor of brain problems. !",Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children,9969289,R01AA026834,"['2 year old', '3 year old', '3-Dimensional', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neonatal', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'alcohol exposure', 'antenatal', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data fusion', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'efficacy testing', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal alcohol use', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal depression', 'multimodality', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal exposure', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'shape analysis', 'statistics', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,530736,-0.021150541473227428
"Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria Project Summary: FASD is a serious public health crisis with 80,000 to 120,000 U.S. pregnancies per year at high risk. FASD diagnostic clinics are very sparse, difficult to sustain because of diagnostic complexity, unable to meet demand, and plagued by disagreement about diagnostic criteria. A recent comparison of five FASD diagnostic systems acknowledged that the lack of objective biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) contributes to disagreement in the field. The goal of the proposed work is to develop and refine neuroimaging methods capable of identifying subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE. A critical component of this project will be to apply these refined neuroimaging “biomarkers” to examine the validity and performance of the most commonly-used FASD diagnostic criteria (alcohol exposure, dysmorphology, growth, and cognition). The proposed project will push the development of imaging methods and will also include an examination of the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic factors. The aims are: 1) perform a comprehensive characterization of the FASD “connectome” using state-of- the-art Human Connectome Project (HCP) methods in children with PAE, 2) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FASD diagnostic criteria to provide objective evaluation of FASD criteria (which remain in flux), 3) characterize relationships between connectomics and cognitive functioning, & 4) examine the developmental course of functional connectivity, white matter connectivity, cortical gyrification, and intra-cortical myelin. Participants will undergo longitudinal re-assessment at 15-months to match the new HCP-development paradigm (HCP-D) to allow for comparison to a large normative dataset being collected in Minnesota as part of the HCP-D project. We will capitalize on the developments spawned from the $40 million HCP and will benefit from evaluating the brains of children with PAE against the backdrop of a very large HCP normative dataset (n=1300). The proposed study will examine 45 participants with PAE and 45 matched controls, ages 8-16, all of whom will be evaluated by the CIFASD dysmorphology project. Participants will undergo MRI scans at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at baseline and again 15 months later. The imaging protocol, which contains very high resolution structural, diffusion- weighted, and fMRI scans will evaluate cortical gyrification, intra-cortical myelin, white matter connectivity, and functional connectivity. Data from the HCP-D project will be used as secondary “normative” comparison dataset. We expect to find a number of subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE that have not previously been observed and we will characterize individuals with these metrics. Individual identification of neurodevelopmental anomalies will then allow us to probe the screening properties of commonly used FASD diagnostic criteria and to test the performance of Dr. Mattson's Decision Tree model for rapidly identifying children with developmental effects of PAE. The study will have direct implications for FASD clinical practice and public policies as it will provide objective data about the relative advantages and disadvantages of individual diagnostic elements and it will allow for comparisons of competing FASD diagnostic systems. The proposed project aims to use the most advanced MRI brain imaging techniques available to address a highly practical problem faced by clinicians and public health officials: the lack of consensus about diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and the challenges of identifying individuals who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but do not have the physical characteristics upon which a diagnosis can be made. The proposed study will identify subtle brain anomalies in children with PAE with a level of sensitivity not previously attainable. The study will push forward our understanding of how PAE negatively affects the efficiency of the brain's networks. In addition, the study will use these brain imaging results to further refine the diagnostic criteria such that more children will be able to be properly identified as having a neurodevelopmental disorder as a result of PAE.",Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria,9940992,U01AA026102,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dysmorphology', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Myelin', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'connectome', 'diffusion weighted', 'executive function', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'performance tests', 'prisma', 'processing speed', 'screening', 'white matter']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2020,344735,-0.005079775349654817
"Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies Project Summary Traditionally, environmental epidemiologic studies have focused on assessing risks related to a single pollutant at a time. This, however, does not reflect reality, since we are constantly exposed to multiple pollutants at once. It is very important, therefore, to be able to assess exposure to pollutant mixtures when conducting environmental epidemiologic methods. Doing so, however, is especially challenging, mainly due to the high dimension of the multi-pollutant exposure matrix (if the exposure of interest includes more than e.g. 5 or 10 chemicals) and because these pollutants are usually very highly correlated with each other. Although some methods are available to address these issues, they usually require strong assumptions and have severe limitations. With this study we propose to bypass most of these limitations by adapting and extending a novel and robust method to assess exposure to multiple pollutants, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). We will assess the performance of PCP synthetic datasets representing multiple potential scenarios and study designs, and compare our results to those obtained by existing methods. Subsequently, we will apply PCP to three important Public Health issues, i.e. to evaluate the associations between (i) in utero exposure to a mixture of PCBs and neurodevelopment, (ii) exposure to a metals mixture and cardiovascular health, and (iii) exposure to an air pollution mixture and emergency cardiovascular admissions. Finally, we will develop and share software so other researchers can freely use this novel, robust and flexible tool across a plethora of study designs and research questions. Our proposed work will be significant as it will provide epidemiologists with a novel and robust tool to assess exposure to environmental pollutant mixtures. Project Narrative We are constantly exposed to a mixture of environmental pollutants at once, but current epidemiologic methods either assess each pollutant separately, not capturing reality, or have severe limitations. With this study we propose to adapt a wildly popular method used in computer vision applications, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), and develop flexible extensions for many epidemiologic settings. We propose to assess the performance of this method, compare with existing methods and employ in real-life applications, as well as develop and share software so other research can also use this novel, robust and flexible tool.",Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies,9843133,R01ES028805,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Educational workshop', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Poison', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Work', 'cardiovascular emergency', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'policy implication', 'pollutant', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,569866,0.050243561265055345
"Physical, Social, and Economic Environments and Firearm Fatalities among Youth Project Summary / Abstract (30 lines) As a social epidemiologist and junior faculty member at UC Davis, my career goal is to build a program of research that identifies fundamental causes of violence and its determinants, and to use this understanding to test effective approaches to reduce violence-related harm. The relationship between neighborhood-level characteristics and firearm violence is well recognized. However, these multiple exposures likely operate in complex and reciprocal ways with each other and with crime and violence that are not yet well understood. Therefore, I propose to take advantage of an existing dataset built for an ongoing study of demolition and rehabilitation of decaying properties in Cleveland, Ohio and Detroit, Michigan, for which I am the principal investigator, to describe the range of neighborhood-level exposures in each of these cities and to identify how these exposures work together to impact firearm violence. These objectives will be accomplished through three specific aims: Aim 1: To describe variation in classes of neighborhood interventions across neighborhoods and neighborhood characteristics in Cleveland, Ohio and Detroit, Michigan from 2010 through 2019; Aim 2: to identify the neighborhood-level exposures that are most predictive of high levels of neighborhood youth firearm violence; and Aim 3: to estimate effects of individual neighborhood interventions and classes of neighborhood interventions on rates of neighborhood violent crime, firearm-related crime, firearm homicides, and firearm suicides among youth and young adults age 10 to 29. I will use detailed datasets primarily built from parcel- level administrative data in each city in order to accomplish the aims of the proposed study. These datasets use micro-data to describe neighborhood characteristics such as home quality, foreclosure rates, land use type, and vacancies. These micro-data are coupled with census variables on demographics, education levels, and other socioeconomic indicators and are aggregated to census tracts. We also undertook a thorough and systematic review of programs and policies hypothesized to influence violence prevention, either directly (e.g. changes in policing strategies) or indirectly (e.g. incentives to encourage buying homes in specific neighborhoods) and critical events, defined as expected and unexpected shocks to the cities, over the study period (2010-2019). These interventions and events are mapped to specific locations and dates. I will use a range of rigorous statistical methods, including latent class analysis, ensemble machine learning and causal inference methods, and spatial analysis methods to accomplish the study aims. I have identified three critical areas where continued training will prepare me to pursue my career goals and make important contributions to the field of violence prevention. These include training in 1) spatial analysis, 2) criminology and criminal justice theory, and 3) the analysis of multiple, correlated exposures. The experience gained through the proposed program of study will help me develop the skills, understanding, and experience I need to succeed in my career goals and allow me to answer critical questions on neighborhood exposures and youth firearm violence. Project Narrative (3 sentences) While the relationship between neighborhood-level characteristics and firearm violence is well recognized, very little is known about the relative importance and joint effects of the multiple and dynamic exposures that make up the neighborhood environment. Describing the range of exposures and their relative importance in predicting youth firearm violence, as well as the independent and joint effects of these exposures on firearm violence is critical for developing a deeper understanding of how “place” affects violence. Investigation of the environmental causes of firearm violence may illuminate broad-based interventions with a greater ability to achieve widespread and lasting impacts.","Physical, Social, and Economic Environments and Firearm Fatalities among Youth",10136967,K01CE003224,[' '],NCIPC,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,K01,2020,124066,0.007530178821565092
"Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment. Abstract Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities, with prevalence estimates of 3-10/1000 individuals in the US and up to 80/1000 in endemic communities. The promise of an increasing number of interventions tailored to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE)-related neurobehavioral deficits is limited by diagnostic difficulties in clinical practice. Currently known biomarkers of exposure are neither sensitive nor specific for neurobehavioral deficits, in part because not all exposed children are affected. There is, therefore, a critical need for biomarkers of effect to identify affected children who would benefit from early, tailored therapeutic interventions. A growing body of literature has demonstrated alcohol-induced alterations in epigenetic programming as an important potential mechanism in FASD, suggesting that such alterations may serve as biomarkers of effect. Imprinted genes comprise a unique subset of epigenetically regulated genes that is sensitive to prenatal insults. There is considerable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected by FASD and those seen in experimental animal models of imprinted gene dysregulation, including learning, memory, and attachment. In a prenatally- recruited, prospective longitudinal cohort, we recently found that PAE was associated with alterations in placental level of expression of 11 of 93 expressed imprinted genes. Expression changes for five of these genes statistically mediated effects of alcohol on postnatal growth, identifying these alterations as biomarkers of fetal alcohol growth restriction. Given the remarkable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected in FASD and those affected by alteration of imprinted gene expression in animal models, alcohol-induced alterations in placental imprinted gene expression may also provide biomarkers for FASD neurocognitive deficits. Although most epigenetic marks are specific to tissue-type and timing of exposure, genomic imprinting maps and our pilot data indicate that markers of imprinted gene dysregulation identified in placental tissue may be detected in blood samples obtained at older ages. The aims of this study are: (1) To characterize the fetal alcohol-related imprintome signature in the placenta and in blood samples obtained at 6 yr; (2) To identify alterations in imprinted gene level of expression and ICR methylation that can serve as biomarkers of effect; (3) To validate findings in Aims 1 and 2 in blood samples from a 2nd, independent cohort. The data for this study will come from two prospective longitudinal cohorts recruited from the Cape Coloured community in Cape Town, South Africa, where the prevalence of FASD is among the highest in the world. Results from this study will make it possible to identify affected children who would benefit from early therapeutic interventions but would likely not be detected by current diagnostic tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite widespread public health advisories, alcohol use during pregnancy persists in the U.S. and worldwide, making fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental delay. The promise of an ever-increasing number of interventions tailored to FASD deficits is limited by difficulties in identifying fetal alcohol-related facial dysmorphology in infancy and early childhood, when interventions are most effective, and in children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, in which neurodevelopmental impairment occurs in the absence of dysmorphic features. This proposal seeks to identify alterations in imprinted gene expression that can be used as biomarkers of adverse effect to identify infants and children with FASD who would benefit from therapeutic interventions but would probably not be detected by current diagnostic tools.",Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment.,10023145,R01AA027916,"['Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Growth Disorders', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methylation', 'Microcephaly', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Nursery Schools', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Placenta', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'South Africa', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'early childhood', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gene function', 'imprint', 'infancy', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'whole genome']",NIAAA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,632755,-0.018708435988142993
"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%. Despite progress that has been made in recent years to understand the anatomical and functional attributes of OSAS in children, the precise mechanism leading to the disorder remains unknown in the majority of obese children, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to implement state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image analytics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomechanical modeling, to establish the biomechanical basis that leads to OSAS or protects from it, in naïve and treated children with obesity. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9947999,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', '3-Dimensional', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'ROC Curve', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tonsil', 'Treatment outcome', 'analytical tool', 'automated segmentation', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiometabolism', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,740371,0.0559485679962602

"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9942495,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,173441,0.011175509872551063
"A Learning Health System Approach to Precision Sedation and Analgesia in Critically-Ill Children PROJECT ABSTRACT Approximately 500,000 children suffer critical illness every year in the United States and more than one third will receive a continuous infusion of a sedative-analgesic medication such as an opioid or dexmedetomidine. Such drugs are commonly administered to ease the burden of critical illness by treating serious pain and anxiety associated with invasive organ support delivery and procedures in the intensive care unit. However, there are no widely-accepted standards for the administration of these potent neuroactive medications and several studies have demonstrated that children receive too little or too much of these medications nearly half of the time they are administered. This imprecision in conventional dosing strategies leads to adverse events, including acute physiologic deterioration, drug tolerance and dependency, prolonged illness and hospitalization and life-threatening complications of invasive support such as unplanned extubation and post-extubation airway obstruction. Evidence also indicates that relatively short exposures to these medications may be detrimental to long-term neurodevelopment. More precise strategies for administering these medications to children are needed and this is an issue of major  PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinicians caring for critically ill children routinely struggle to harmonize the tension between giving too much versus too little sedation-analgesia. This work will (1) identify patterns of sedation-analgesia associated with outcome; (2) identify genotypes associated with sedation-analgesia administration; (3) characterize PK parameters of common sedative-analgesic mediations; and (4) promote the development of the PI as an independent Learning Health System researcher.

"Images of Children and Adults for Health Research Abstract: This project's goal of expanding the extant archive for a major longitudinal study to include an innovative collection of images of children and adults is well-aligned with the initiative (PAR-16-149) to support the archiving of NICHD-funded data sets for secondary data analyses. The longitudinal study was funded through a U01 partnership with NICHD, and the images that will be added to its archive can take longitudinal and intergenerational health research in significantly new directions. As background, the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD) was a major investment of NICHD in a longitudinal study of children and parents. The observational, survey, medical, biological, and video data from the NICHD- sponsored data collection over 15 years are archived at the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), with data collection on the now-adult sample ongoing. A current R01 project by the PIs of this proposal has developed a systematic process for extracting and rating “short slice” images of children and parents from videos. This system has resulted in short slices of children at 11 time points, short slices of mothers at four time points, and ratings of the attractiveness of their faces and bodies at all these time points. The child ratings—along with a detailed codebook—are already being added to the SECCYD archive through the current R01 so that health scholars licensed with ICPSR can merge them with the SECCYD for analyses of child and adolescent development. The proposed R03 would allow a substantial and valuable expansion by also archiving the actual short slices of children, extracting short slices of mothers at the remaining time points, extracting the short slices of fathers at the five time points they were videotaped, and adding all of these short slices to the archive along with expanded codebooks. The PIs are partnering with ICPSR to open up their secure system for housing and organizing these images so that other researchers could use them for their own purposes and not have to travel to the ICSPR data enclave. Such an enterprise would exploit the original R01 project to realize substantial economies of scale in creating a resource for health research to inform a wide array of health and health-relevant literatures. Indeed, a substantial body of research has documented the valid and reliable ways that images of the face and body can be used. For example, scholars could access this expanded SECCYD archive to examine the development of health conditions (e.g., obesity), the corrosive effects of disadvantage on health (e.g., the physical toll of poverty), the link between social stigmas and health (e.g., colorism and depression), family health dynamics (e.g., disjunctures in health of parents and children), and other important questions concerning individual and population health. They can also go beyond human rating to exploit new machine scoring techniques that enable measurements beyond the human eye that provide insights into biological processes (e.g., hormone levels, sexual dimorphism). The codebooks will also provide a template for other scholars to expand their own NIH-funded data collections or to launch new ones. Project Narrative In response to a NICHD funding opportunity on archiving datasets, this project will significantly contribute to a number of fields of health research by archiving an expansive longitudinal set of images of the faces and bodies of children and their parents over a 15 year period. With a secure system to facilitate ease of access and use, such images can be human rated (e.g., perceived age, weight, skin color) and machine scored (e.g., biologically informative facial measurements) to measure continuity and change in physical development and health and to capture the physical toll of the environment on individual wellbeing. Extending a prior NICHD- funded project that rated 11 waves of videos from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development to longitudinally study children's appearance, this larger archive of images will provide a valuable resource for researchers aiming to conduct innovative research on health and health disparities.",Images of Children and Adults for Health Research,9923679,R03HD096203,"['Academic achievement', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Appearance', 'Archives', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Birds', 'Birth', 'Catalogs', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Corrosives', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline', 'Documentation', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Family health status', 'Fathers', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Guidelines', 'Half-Life', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health Status', 'Hormones', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Investments', 'Licensing', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nose', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Social Environment', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Videotape', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'base', 'data archive', 'data enclave', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'image archival system', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'middle age', 'population health', 'recruit', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sexual dimorphism', 'skin color', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social implication', 'social stigma', 'transmission process']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2020,83342,0.041916196550788945
"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities,9994891,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain shape', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'early childhood', 'hearing impairment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multi-task learning', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,448068,-0.004130137286922354
"A bench to population epidemiologic approach to investigating the effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child gut inflammation, growth, and development PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Lin is a research scientist at the University of California, Berkeley in Professor John (Jack) Colford's group. She completed her PhD in Microbiology and Immunology at Stanford University in 2012. Since 2010, she has worked as the coordinating microbiologist for the WASH Benefits study, a large-scale, multi- country cluster randomized trial evaluating the impact of water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutritional interventions on child health, with a focus on gut inflammation. This research and training plan builds on her strong interdisciplinary background at the nexus of microbiology, immunology, and global health. Gaining experience in epidemiology and biostatistics will facilitate her transition to a `bench to population' independent investigator at UC Berkeley and will ultimately enable her to achieve her long-term career goal to become a global health leader in the evaluation of antenatal and early life interventions to improve child health. Environment: UC Berkeley has a long history of conducting innovative and groundbreaking research advancing epidemiological and biostatistical theory and application in international health. To achieve her career goal, Dr. Lin seeks training in (1) epidemiology, with a focus on causal inference methods (in particular, marginal structural models for direct and indirect effects and targeted maximum likelihood estimation) (2) biostatistics and (3) child stress and development. To achieve these goals, Dr. Lin has assembled a unique interdisciplinary training and mentoring team based at UC Berkeley. Jack Colford (primary mentor) will guide her training in epidemiological theory and application. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor) will guide her training in biostatistics and causal inference methods including models for direct and indirect effects and targeted maximum likelihood estimation. Lia Fernald (co-mentor) will guide her training in child development and stress. Research Project: Early life linear growth faltering is associated with impaired development, but its underlying pathogenesis is poorly understood. Subclinical intestinal inflammation and damage affects children living in low-income countries and is increasingly recognized as a potential main contributor to the vicious cycle of early life malnutrition and oral vaccine failure. Little is known about the pregnancy risk factors associated with gut inflammation and the impact of these antenatal factors on linear growth and neurodevelopment. In Aim 1, Dr. Lin will determine the association between maternal stress and inflammation during pregnancy and subsequent measures of child gut inflammation and permeability. In Aim 2, she will evaluate the relationship between antenatal stress and inflammation and future child linear growth and development. She proposes to use modern causal inference methods to elucidate the potential pathways from antenatal stress and inflammation to child gut inflammation, linear growth faltering, and poor development. Ultimately, this mentored research will prepare Dr. Lin for a successful R01-level application to investigate potential downstream effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child stress, inflammation, and susceptibility to infections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Widely pervasive subclinical inflammation and damage of the small intestine is observed in children living in low-income countries and is increasingly recognized as a potential main contributor to the vicious cycle of early life malnutrition and oral vaccine failure. Little is known about the pregnancy risk factors associated with gut inflammation and permeability and the impact of these antenatal factors on linear growth and neurodevelopment in infants from low-income countries. Understanding these critical pathways will be an important contribution to public health because it will enable the identification of key biological markers to identify prospectively at-risk children, to evaluate the efficacy of interventions, and to suggest potential intervention targets to improve child linear growth and development trajectories; we propose to use modern causal inference methods to elucidate these critical pathways in children living in rural Bangladesh.","A bench to population epidemiologic approach to investigating the effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child gut inflammation, growth, and development",9989761,K01AI136885,"['5 year old', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'C-reactive protein', 'California', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Country', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'F2-Isoprostanes', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hygiene', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Lactulose', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Mannitol', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neopterin', 'Nutritional', 'Observational Study', 'Orosomucoid', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peroxidases', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Small Intestines', 'Stress', 'Structural Models', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Villous Atrophy', 'Water', 'Work', 'absorption', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin', 'antenatal', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'career', 'cytokine', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'fetal programming', 'global health', 'improved', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'innovation', 'low income country', 'maternal stress', 'neurodevelopment', 'oral vaccine', 'prevent', 'professor', 'prospective', 'repository', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'therapy development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2020,135454,0.03939911944534522
"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual projects.",Administrative Core of the CIFASD,9940986,U24AA014811,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data management', 'diagnostic screening', 'drinking', 'eHealth', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'forging', 'health care service', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical research', 'program dissemination', 'recruit', 'repository', 'resilience', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web site']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2020,428830,-0.05978797430339266
"Linking State Medicaid and Congenital Heart Surgical Registry Data: Building Capacity to Assess Disparities in Longitudinal Outcomes and Value for Children with Congenital Heart Disease Project Summary Congenital heart defects are the most common and resource intensive birth defects managed in the United States with high morbidity and mortality. They are estimated to effect over 1 million US children and 1.4 million US adults and to result in ~200,000 life-years lost and >$6 billion in inpatient acute care costs per year. Significant disparities are known to exist in short-term outcomes and resource utilization. We have shown that children from low income neighborhoods have 18% higher risk-adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality, have 7% longer lengths-of-stay, and require 7% more perioperative resources than do children from higher income neighborhoods, even after controlling for the effects of race, public versus private insurance provider, and the hospitals at which these children ultimately receive surgical repair. Research on long-term outcomes and health expenditures is limited and mechanisms driving health inequities remain unknown. Greater than 50% of children with congenital heart disease are covered by Medicaid. We have partnered with the NY Department of Health and have clean, validated data for all Medicaid patient encounters over 15 years across NY State. We have developed methods of abstracting and linking locally-held clinical registry data to Medicaid files and have built an interdisciplinary team of pediatric cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, health services researchers, health economists, and NY Department of Health senior leadership to identify dimensions of healthcare access that could be targeted through center- or state-level interventions to reduce inequities. We propose linking pediatric cardiac surgical clinical registry data from across NY State, longitudinal Medicaid claims, Census Bureau data, geocoded data, and the National Death Index. We will use these data to accomplish the following Aims: 1) We will define 10-year risk-stratified, multi-dimensional outcomes (mortality and morbidities) and associated health expenditures for children undergoing congenital heart surgery across New York State; 2) we will develop novel longitudinal risk models for children with congenital heart disease that adjust for social determinants of health, and 3) we will test dimensions of healthcare access as modifiable drivers of health inequities among children in New York with congenital heart disease on Medicaid. Achieving our aims would 1) establish a comprehensive, population-based resource for longitudinal outcomes and health expenditure research, inclusive of not only in-patient data, but also out-patient, emergency room, pharmacy, rehabilitation, home healthcare, education records, and neighborhood-level social determinants of health for nearly half of all children undergoing congenital heart surgery in NY State, 2) generate a methodology for investigations on long-term outcomes and value applicable across multiple populations, 3) assess constructs of access as modifiable mediators of social determinants of health, and 4) position us to translate these findings into policy and care changes to reduce health inequities. Project Narrative Congenital heart defects are the most common and resource intensive birth defects managed in the United States, estimated to effect over 1 million US children and 1.4 million US adults and to result in ~200,000 life- years lost and >$6 billion in inpatient acute care costs per year, with significantly worse outcomes for children from lower income neighborhoods and minorities. Despite the high prevalence, research on long-term outcomes and health expenditures is limited and etiologies of health inequities remain unknown. Linking clinical registries with longitudinal state-wide Medicaid data will 1) build a scalable resource that will allow us to assess longitudinal outcomes and resource requirements at a population level 2) generate a methodology for investigations on long-term outcomes and value, 3) assess constructs of access as modifiable mediators of social determinants of health, and 4) immediately inform policy and care.",Linking State Medicaid and Congenital Heart Surgical Registry Data: Building Capacity to Assess Disparities in Longitudinal Outcomes and Value for Children with Congenital Heart Disease,9864807,R01HL150044,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Ratios', 'Birth', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Child Mortality', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Congresses', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Expenditure', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Services', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Home Care Services', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Insurance', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'New York', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Surgeon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'abstracting', 'acute care', 'care costs', 'college', 'congenital heart disorder', 'cost', 'data registry', 'disorder subtype', 'follow-up', 'health care availability', 'health care service', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'neonatal surgery', 'novel', 'pediatric cardiologist', 'population based', 'repaired', 'social determinants', 'social health determinants', 'years of life lost']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,495156,0.0012474120288018932
"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,9928464,R01ES030302,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Arsenic', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cadmium', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Diseases', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Manganese', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Temperament', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxin', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'behavioral disinhibition', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early pregnancy', 'epigenetic marker', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'loss of function', 'metal poisoning', 'nanosized', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'overexpression', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal risk factor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell proliferation', 'tool', 'toxic metal', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,653362,0.05603029159448191
