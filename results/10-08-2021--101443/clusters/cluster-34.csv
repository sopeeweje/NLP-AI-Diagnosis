"Reproducible Analytics for Secondary Analyses of ImmPort Vaccination-Related Cytometry Data Project Summary The immunology database and analysis portal (ImmPort, http://immport.niaid.nih.gov) is the NIAID-funded public resource for data archive and dissemination from clinical trials and mechanistic research projects. Among the current 291 studies archived in ImmPort, 114 are focused on vaccine responses (91 for influenza vaccine responses), which is the largest category when organized by research focus. As the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases, development of the next-generation vaccines is faced with the bottleneck that traditional empirical design becomes ineffective to stimulate human protective immunity against HIV, RSV, CMV, and other recent major public health threats. This project will focus on three important aspects of informatics approaches to secondary analysis of ImmPort data for influenza vaccination research: a) expanding the data analytical capabilities of ImmPort and ImmPortGalaxy through adding innovative computational methods for user-friendly unsupervised identification of cell populations, b) processing and analyzing a subset of the existing human influenza vaccination study data in ImmPort to identify cell-based biomarkers using the new computational methods, and c) returning data analysis results with data analytical provenance to ImmPort for dissemination of derived data, software tools, as well as semantic assertions of the identified biomarkers. Each aspect is one specific research aim in the proposed work. The project outcome will not only demonstrate the utility of the ImmPort data archive but also generate a foundation for the Human Vaccine Project (HVP) to establish pilot programs for influenza vaccine research, which currently include Vanderbilt University Medical Center; University of California San Diego (UCSD); Scripps Research Institute; La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology; and J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI). Once such computational analytical workflow is established, it can be applied to the secondary analysis of other ImmPort studies as well as to support the user-driven analytics of their own cytometry data. Each of the specific aims contains innovative methods or new applications of the existing methods. The computational method for population identification in Aim 1 is a newly developed constrained data clustering method, which combines advantages of unsupervised and supervised learning. Cutting-edge machine learning approaches including random forest will be used in Aim 2 for the identification of biomarkers across study cohorts, in addition to the traditional statistical hypothesis testing. Standardized knowledge representation to be developed in Aim 3 for cell-based biomarkers is also innovative, as semantic networks with inferring and deriving capabilities can be built based on the machine-readable knowledge assertions. The proposed work, when accomplished, will foster broader collaboration between ImmPort and the existing vaccine research consortia. It will also accelerate the deployment of up-to-date informatics software tools on ImmPortGalaxy. Project Narrative Flow cytometry (FCM) plays important roles in human influenza vaccination studies through interrogating immune cellular functions and quantifying the immune responses in different conditions. This project will extend the current data analytical capabilities of the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) through adding novel data analytical methods and software tools for user-friendly identification of cell populations from FCM data in ImmPort influenza vaccine response studies. The derived data and the knowledge generated from the secondary analysis of the ImmPort vaccination study data will be deposited back to ImmPort and shared with the Human Vaccines Project (HVP) consortium for dissemination.",Reproducible Analytics for Secondary Analyses of ImmPort Vaccination-Related Cytometry Data,9724345,UH2AI132342,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Archives', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Failure', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HIV', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Maps', 'Measles', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mumps', 'Names', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Population', 'Population Statistics', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readability', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Institute', 'Research Project Grants', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines', 'Respiratory syncytial virus', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Semantics', 'Smallpox', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker identification', 'catalyst', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized tools', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data portal', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'immune function', 'improved', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'neoplastic', 'news', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel vaccines', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public-private partnership', 'random forest', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'secondary analysis', 'statistics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'user-friendly', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial', 'vaccine-induced immunity']",NIAID,"J.

"The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence Project Summary Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are the most common types of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in the world. VBD epidemics have been increasing over recent decades, with tickborne diseases having doubled in the last decade in the United States. Despite the increase in public health burden, over 80% of vector-control organizations lack preventative capabilities. Understanding the interplay between the environment, vectors, pathogens, and humans that expedite disease spread remains a challenge. The overarching goal of this project is to identify the key environmental and human drivers that have led to the emergence of VBDs. Current models that predict tickborne disease risk have oversimplified the process by focusing only on the vector, i.e. risk of tick exposure. A human’s risk of infection is not only a function of entomological risk but also of factors inherent to the individual including behavior or characteristics that increase susceptibility to disease. This project proposes a novel approach to tickborne disease prediction by developing a comprehensive model that incorporate pathogen population dynamics and human factors to predict disease risk. This study will investigate several pathogens vectored by the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis): Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic anaplasmosis), and Babesia microti (babesiosis). The central hypothesis is that the prediction of tickborne disease risk can be improved by using sophisticated statistical methods to identify environmental drivers that impact pathogen population dynamics while incorporating human demographic characteristics. The hypothesis will be addressed in the following aims: (1) Determine the current and historical population dynamic patterns of pathogens vectored by I. scapularis to predict pathogen distribution; (2) Determine the association between human characteristics and tick-borne disease risk in order to develop an improved spatial disease risk model. This model will allow the identification and quantification of factors that are associated with the emergence of tickborne diseases in New York State, which is geographically advantageous because it is representative of much of the natural environment that ticks encounter in the northeastern US including rapid and recent changes in climate and landscapes. The results of this project will be used to develop a public disease warning system that will use contemporary and future climate forecasts to monitor tick populations and predict potential disease outbreaks for areas with vulnerable populations. With climate forecasts predicting an increase in 2-3°C in temperature by 2100, there is uncertainty in how diseases will shift and a warning system will allow preparation accordingly. At the completion of the proposed research project, the applicant will have acquired the following skillsets through intensive, interdisciplinary mentorship: big data analysis, advanced statistics including Bayesian and machine learning methods, spatial analyses, and risk analysis. This will enable the applicant to succeed as an independent investigator to address the challenges posed by emerging infectious diseases. Project Narrative Vector-borne diseases are the most common types of emerging infectious diseases in the world and constitute major threats to public health. My project uses advanced statistical methods to uncover how interactions between environmental factors affecting pathogen population dynamics and human demographic characteristics determine human risk for three tick-borne diseases: Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. The results of my project will be used to create a risk map to predict the spatial and temporal occurrence of tickborne diseases, which can inform public health strategies in order to mitigate disease burden.",The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence,9758579,F31AI133871,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Anaplasma phagocytophilum', 'Anaplasmosis', 'Area', 'Award', 'Babesia microti', 'Babesiosis', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bite', 'Black-legged Tick', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Characteristics', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Contracts', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Trees', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecological Change', 'Ecology', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Entomology', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'New York', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Tick-Borne Diseases', 'Tick-Borne Infections', 'Ticks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'anthropogenesis', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cost effective', 'decision tree learning', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'environmental change', 'geographic population', 'granulocyte', 'human disease', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'learning strategy', 'model design', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pathogen exposure', 'predictive modeling', 'regression trees', 'spatial temporal variation', 'statistics', 'tick-borne pathogen', 'trend', 'vector', 'vector control', 'vector transmission']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2019,45016,0.04061992490202222
"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This study is to develop and validate a genome based strategy for influenza vaccine strain selection, and it will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.",Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning,9610628,R01AI116744,"['Affect', 'Africa', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryo', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Hemagglutination', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immunology procedure', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Infrastructure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scientist', 'Seasons', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Ships', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Production', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'candidate selection', 'egg', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'influenza surveillance', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'learning strategy', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,224899,0.05434684345500071
"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities. Pollinators serve a critical role in our native ecosystems as well as agricultural crops, providing billions of dollars in pollination services annually. Recently, parasites have been linked to declines of several pollinator species. Thus, a better understanding of parasite transmission among bees has important conservation and economic implications.",Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities,9750722,R01GM122062,"['Address', 'Agricultural Crops', 'Angiosperms', 'Bees', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Disease model', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Organism', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'economic implication', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'network models', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vector']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,527585,0.032201423362246434
"Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity PROJECT SUMMARY Reliable and real-time municipality-level predictive modeling and forecasts of infectious disease activity have the potential to transform the way public health decision-makers design interventions such as information campaigns, preemptive/reactive vaccinations, and vector control, in the presence of health threats across the world. While the links between disease activity and factors such as: human mobility, climate and environmental factors, socio-economic determinants, and social media activity have long been known in the epidemic literature, few efforts have focused on the evident need of developing an open-source platform capable of leveraging multiple data sources, factors, and disparate modeling methodologies, across a large and heterogeneous nation to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over four geographic scales (nation, state, city, and municipal). The overall goal of this project is to develop such a platform. Our long-term goal is to investigate effective ways to incorporate the findings from multiple disparate studies on disease dynamics around the globe with local and global factors such as weather conditions, socio- economic status, satellite imagery and online human behavior, to develop an operational, robust, and real- time data-driven disease forecasting platform. The objective of this grant is to leverage the expertise of three complementary scientific research teams and a wealth of information from a diverse array of data sources to build a modeling platform capable of combining information to produce real-time short term disease forecasts at the local level. As part of this, we will evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales--nation, state, city, and municipality--using Brazil as a test case. Additionally, we will use machine learning and mechanistic models to understand disease dynamics at multiple spatial scales, across a heterogeneous country such as Brazil. Our specific aims will (1) Assess the utility of individual data streams and modeling techniques for disease forecasting; (2) Fuse modeling techniques and data streams to improve accuracy and robustness at the four spatial scales; (3) Characterize the basic computational infrastructure necessary to build an operational disease forecasting platform; and (4) Validate our approach in a real-world setting. This contribution is significant because It will advance our scientific knowledge on the accuracy and limitations of disparate data streams and multiple modeling approaches when used to forecast disease transmission. Our efforts will help produce operational and systematic disease forecasts at a local level (city- and municipality-level). Moreover, we aim at building a new open-source computational platform for the epidemiological community to use as a knowledge discovery tool. Finally, we aim at developing this platform under the guidance of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) panel comprising of WHO, CDC, academics, and local and federal stakeholders within Brazil. The proposed approach is innovative because few efforts have focused on developing an open-source computational platform capable of combining disparate data sources and drivers, across a heterogeneous and large nation, into multiple modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over multiple geographic scales.. In addition, we propose to investigate how to best combine modeling approaches that have, to this date, been developed and interpreted independently, namely, traditional epidemiological mechanistic models and novel machine-learning predictive models, in order to produce accurate and robust real-time disease activity estimates and forecasts. Project Narrative The proposed research is of crucial importance to public health surveillance and preparedness communities because it seeks to identify effective ways to utilize previously disconnected results, that have pointed out links between disease spread and factors such as socio-economic status, local weather conditions, human mobility, social media activity, to build an open-source and data driven, modeling platform capable of extracting and disseminating information from disparate data sources, and complementary modeling approaches, to (1) Evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales: nation, state, city, and municipality; (2) Fuse complementary modeling approaches that have been developed independently and oftentimes not used in conjunction; (3) produce real- time and short term forecasts of disease activity in multiple geographic scales across a heterogeneous and large nation like Brazil.",Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity,9789907,R01GM130668,"['Area', 'Assimilations', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Brazil', 'Burn injury', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dengue', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Municipalities', 'Population Surveillance', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stream', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'Vaccination', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Water', 'Weather', 'Work', 'Zika Virus', 'base', 'chikungunya', 'climate variability', 'computational platform', 'computer infrastructure', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'economic determinant', 'experience', 'flu', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'social media', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'spreading factor', 'therapy design', 'time use', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'vector control', 'vector-borne']",NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,366616,0.02816458480719277
"Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease Challenge, Innovation and Impact: In recent years, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to predict epidemic disease outbreaks from retrospective seasonal and geographical case data and to show that we can take climate factors into account in our predictive models. We are moving closer to real-time prediction at the population level. But we have never used prediction at point-of-care for treating the individual patient.  Presently, personalized medicine uses delayed results of laboratory testing of individuals. For infectious disease, most of such testing has targeted the pathogen in the host-pathogen interaction. The role of laboratory testing is to modify therapy after a variable period of time delay. Personalized medicine today is reactive. Complicating matters further, many infectious epidemic diseases are strongly dependent on environmental factors and climate. Lastly, we want to name the pathogens we are fighting, but we really need to know the resistance characteristics to select therapy for patients effectively. Both speciation and resistance can now be determined from molecular data, which can be integrated into point-of-care treatment predictions.  We here propose a radically different approach to the treatment of infectious diseases. Our hypothesis is that the alternative to time-delayed and expensive laboratory analysis of specimens from individual patients, is to use predictive modeling to forecast point-of-care treatment. Time-delayed personalized testing can be conducted as surveillance, and that data used for real-time prediction to guide point-of-care treatment.  We will introduce predictive personalized public health (P3H) policy at the individual patient level, with the potential to substantially improve patient outcomes compared with our present reactive approaches. Our key rationale is to expand population infectious disease predictive modeling in order to achieve prediction for treatment at point-of-care. Our primary insight is that we can reposition the delayed reactive personalized testing from the urgent medical decision-making process, and into a predictive modeling framework. The gaps and opportunities in technology that we will address are four-fold. First, we will employ individual case geospatial mapping at a fine scale to take into account infection spread and environmental factors. Second, our ability to perform pan-microbial analysis using molecular techniques is now feasible. Third, modeling our novel fusion of data has no simple low-dimensional solution – but machine learning technologies are now capable of handling such big data assimilation, model discovery and prediction. Fourth, our proposal is not an academic exercise. We have a partnership with the economic planners within a developing country to design and implement our new methods. We will prospectively tune and validate our algorithms in real-time. Our deliverable will be an open-source framework ready for clinical trials testing and adaptation to the public health infrastructure in any country. Project Narrative We have made substantial progress in our abilities to track and predict infectious disease epidemics at the population level, but prediction has never been used at the individual level to guide treatment at point-of-care. The individual treatment for all infectious disease syndromes at point-of-care is presently empirical, because laboratory testing is reactive and time delayed. We here propose a novel framework to use rigorous prediction strategies to guide point-of-care treatment for infectious diseases, and to validate this approach under real-world conditions.",Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease,9776462,R01AI145057,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Assimilations', 'Bacterial Meningitis', 'Bacteriology', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cholera', 'Climate', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Exanthema', 'Exercise', 'Fever', 'Frequencies', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Hand', 'Health Policy', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Leptospirosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measles', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Melioidosis', 'Meningitis', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Newborn Infant', 'Paralysed', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uganda', 'Work', 'acute infection', 'antimicrobial', 'authority', 'climate data', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'fighting', 'flu', 'global health', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infectious disease model', 'infectious disease treatment', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'neonatal infection', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'resistance gene', 'spreading factor', 'surveillance data']",NIAID,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,1606082,0.05457493493892239
"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,9700030,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric infection', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'low income country', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2019,26919,0.051136531597803354
"Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tracking evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread often requires the use of data deposited in public databases such as GenBank, the Influenza Research Database (IRD), or the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR). GenBank provides an abundance of available viral sequence data for phylogeography. Sequences and their metadata can be downloaded and imported into software applications that generate phylogeographic trees and models for surveillance. IRD and ViPR are NIH/NIAID funded programs that import data from GenBank but contain additional data sources, visualization, and search tools for their users. Tracking evolutionary changes and spread also requires the geospatial assignment of taxa, which is often obtained from GenBank metadata. Unfortunately, geospatial metadata such as host location is often uncertain in GenBank entries, with only 36% containing a precise location such as a county, town, or region within a state. For example, information such as China or USA was indicated instead of Beijing or Bedford, NH. While town or county might be included in the corresponding journal article, this valuable information is not available for immediate use unless it is extracted and then linked back to the appropriate sequence. The goal of our work is to enable health agencies and other researchers to automatically generate phylogeographic models that incorporate enhanced geospatial data for better estimates of virus spread. This proposal focuses on developing and applying information extraction and statistical phylogeography approaches to enhance models that track evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread. We propose a framework that uses natural language processing (NLP) for the automatic extraction of relevant geospatial data from the literature, and assigns a confidence between such geospatial mentions and the GenBank record. We will then use these locations and the estimates as observation error in the creation of phylogeographic models of zoonotic virus spread. We hypothesize that a combined NLP-phylogeography infrastructure that produces models that include observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa will be closer to a gold standard than phylogeographic models that do not include them. Our research will extend phylogeography and zoonotic surveillance by: creating a NLP infrastructure that will improve the level of detail of geospatial data for phylogeography of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1), develop phylogeographic models using the estimates from Aim 1 as observation error (Aim 2), and evaluating our approach by comparing the models it produces to models that do not account for observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa (Aim 3). We will allow users to generate enhanced models and view results on a web portal accessible via a LinkOut feature from GenBank, IRD, and ViPR. The addition of more precise geospatial information in building such models could enable health agencies to better target areas that represent the greatest public health risk. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop and evaluate an infrastructure that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify more precise geographic information for modeling spread of zoonotic viruses. These new models could enable public health agencies to identify the most at-risk areas. In addition, by improving geospatial information in popular sequence databases such as GenBank, we will enrich other sciences that utilize this information such as molecular epidemiology, population genetics, and environmental health.",Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error,9665255,R01AI117011,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'China', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Environmental Health', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Genbank', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hantavirus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Influenza', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Manuals', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nucleotides', 'Population Genetics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'RNA Viruses', 'Rabies', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Source', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'System', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'improved', 'information model', 'interest', 'journal article', 'molecular sequence database', 'pathogen', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2019,461012,0.01158605572435621
"Dynamic learning for post-vaccine event prediction using temporal information in VAERS Project Summary Vaccines have been one of the most successful public health interventions to date. They are, however, pharmaceutical products that carry risks. Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine- preventable illnesses. The CDC/FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) contains up to 30,000 reports per year over the past 25 years. VAERS reports include both structured data (e.g., vaccination date, first onset date, age, and gender) and unstructured narratives that often provide detailed clinical information about the clinical events and the temporal relationship of the series of event occurrences post vaccination. The structured data only provide one onsite date whereas temporal information of the sequence of events post vaccination is contained in the unstructured narratives. Current status –While structured data in the VAERS are widely used, the narratives are generally ignored because of the challenges inherent in working with unstructured data. Without these narratives, potentially valuable information is lost. Goals - In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs. Specifically, built upon the state-of-art ontology and natural language processing technologies, we will develop and validate a Temporal Information Modeling, Extraction and Reasoning system for Vaccine data (TIMER-V), which will automatically extract post-vaccination events and their temporal relationships from VAERS reports, semantically infer temporal relations, and integrate the exacted unstructured data with the structured data. Furthermore, we will provide and maintain a publicly available data access interface to query the new integrated data repository, which will facilitate vaccine safety research, casual inference, and other temporal related discovery. We will also develop and validate models to predict severe AEs using the co-occurrence or temporal patterns of the series of AEs post vaccination.

"Bridging Statistical Inference and Mechanistic Network Models for HIV/AIDS Network models are used to investigate the spread of HIV/AIDS, but rather than assuming that the members of a population of interest are fully mixed, the network approach enables individual-level specification of contact patterns by considering the structure of connections among the members of the population. By representing individuals as nodes and contacts between pairs of individuals as edges, this network depiction enables identification of individuals who drive the epidemic, allows for accurate assessment of study power in cluster- randomized trials, and makes it possible to evaluate the impact of interventions on the individuals themselves, their partners, and the broader network. There are currently two major mathematical paradigms to the modeling of networks: the statistical approach and the mechanistic approach. In the statistical approach, one specifies a model that states the likelihood of observing a given network, whereas in the mechanistic approach one specifies a set of domain-specific mechanistic rules at the level of individual nodes, the actors in the network, that are used to evolve the network over time. Given that mechanistic models directly model individual-level behaviors – modification of which is the foundation of most prevention measures – they are a natural fit for infectious diseases. Another attractive feature of mechanistic models is their scalability as they can be implemented for networks consisting of thousands or even millions of nodes, making it possible to simulate population-wide implementation of interventions. Lack of statistical methods for calibrating these models to empirical data has however impeded their use in real-world settings, a limitation that stems from the fact that there are typically no closed-form likelihood functions available for these models due the exponential increase in the number of ways, as a function of network size, of arriving at a given observed network. We propose to overcome this gap by advancing inferential and model selection methods for mechanistic network models, and by developing a framework for investigating their similarities with statistical network models. We base our approach on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), a family of methods developed specifically for settings where likelihood functions are intractable or unavailable. Our specific aims are the following. Aim 1: To develop a statistically principled framework for estimating parameter values and their uncertainty for mechanistic network models. Aim 2: To develop a statistically principled method for model choice between two competing mechanistic network models and estimating the uncertainty surrounding this choice. Aim 3: To establish a framework for mapping mechanistic network models to statistical models. We also propose to implement these methods in open source software, using a combination of Python and C/C++, to facilitate their dissemination and adoption. We believe that the research proposed here can help harness mechanistic network models – and with that leverage some of the insights developed in the network science community over the past decade and more – to help eradicate this disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network models are used to gain a more precise understanding of human behavioral factors associated with the spread of HIV/AIDS in order to develop more effective interventions to halt the epidemic. There are two main mathematical paradigms for modeling networks, the statistical approach and the mechanistic approach, and given that the latter directly models individual-level behaviors – modification of which is the foundation of most prevention measures – mechanistic models are a natural fit for infectious diseases. Lack of statistical methods for calibrating these models to empirical data has so far impeded their use in real-world settings, and we therefore propose to develop parameter inference and model selection methods for mechanistic network models in order to endow the biomedical community with these powerful tools.",Bridging Statistical Inference and Mechanistic Network Models for HIV/AIDS,9817000,R01AI138901,"['AIDS prevention', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Adoption', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Epidemic', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Prevention Measures', 'Prevention strategy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'SET Domain', 'Science', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'effective intervention', 'high dimensionality', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'member', 'network models', 'open source', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'stem', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment strategy']",NIAID,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2019,334891,0.02435529885212349
"Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats SUMMARY: OVERALL  This proposal, Consortium for Immunotherapeutics Against Emerging Viral Diseases, addresses a critical gap in the biodefense portfolio by building an academic-industry partnership to advance effective, fully human, antibody-based immunotherapeutics against three major families of emerging/re-emerging viruses: Lassa virus, Ebola and other Filoviruses, and mosquito-transmitted Alphaviruses that threaten millions worldwide. This program follows directly from our significant body of preliminary data (the largest available for these families of viruses), therapeutics in hand, multidisciplinary expertise, and demonstrated collaborative success. Included in the proposed CETR portfolio are: (1) the only available immunotherapeutics against endemic Lassa virus, with reversal of late-stage disease and complete survival in infected non-human primates, (2) novel Ebola and pan- ebolavirus therapeutics that also completely protect non-human primates from disease, and that were built by the paradigm-shifting and comprehensive analysis of a global consortium, and (3) much needed, first-in-class therapeutics against the re-emerging alphaviruses that have tremendous epidemic potential in the United States and around the globe. These multidisciplinary studies, founded upon pioneering structural biology of the antigen targets, include innovations such as agnostic, high-throughput Fc profiling and optimization, coupled with Fv evolution to enhance potency and developability, as well as a sophisticated statistical and computational analysis core to evaluate thresholds and correlates of protection across the major families of pathogens. Together, we aim to understand what findings represent general rules and what data are specific to each virus family. We also aim to provide streamlined systems for antibody choice and optimization that do not yet exist, and to build a broadly applicable platform for mAb discovery and delivery against any novel pathogen as they emerge. The recent resurgence of Lassa, the epidemic nature of Ebola virus and other re-emerging filoviruses, as well as the major population at risk by global movement of mosquito-borne alphaviruses together demonstrate the tremendous global need for immunotherapeutics developed and advanced by this program. NARRATIVE Three major families of emerging viruses (Lassa and other arenaviruses, Ebola and other filoviruses, and mosquito-borne alphaviruses) threaten human health worldwide, but lack approved therapeutics or vaccines. The proposed multidisciplinary consortium, an academic-industry partnership, will advance safe and effective, fully human, monoclonal antibody therapies against these viruses, using candidate therapies that confer complete protection in non-human primates as our starting point.

"Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem, and current drug pipelines are not keeping pace with the rise of antimicrobial resistance. An alternative strategy is to boost host immunity. An often overlooked side-effect of the vitamin and mineral supplementation projects of the 1940s is that these supplements greatly reduced infectious disease burden. Recent work has shown that further gains may be possible, especially in adding phytochemicals back to highly processed diets typically consumed in the United States. However, we lack a fundamental understanding of how these components are processed by the microbiome, and how diet-derived molecules, microbiome and host immune system work together to resist infectious disease. A key barrier preventing us from making these discoveries is that each individual assay (microbiome, host gene expression metabolome, dietary compounds) is expensive and highly multivariate. Three key insights that enable the current project are the miniaturization of DNA and RNA sequencing assays on advanced nanoliter- scale liquid handling robots, greatly reducing the cost, the combination of untargeted and targeted mass spectrometry on the same samples in high throughput to enable discovery of a much greater chemical space, and the ability to use explicitly spatial maps on multiple scales to integrate the dataset throughout the body and enable both visual analytics and deep learning approaches based on spatial data. These breakthroughs will provide a fundamentally new understanding of how dietary metabolites promote disease resistance, and will allow us to develop a new infrastructure to integrate results from many investigators in different laboratories studying various aspects of these systems. Additionally, the results will allow us to choose biomaterials and biomarkers in human subjects that provide maximum information about internal nutritional and immune status. Results will be tested against the NHANES and American Gut cohorts. The results of this project will therefore be: 3D maps of mouse models showing how the microbiome, diet, and host gene expression produce immunity; an infrastructure for creating and sharing these maps; and a preliminary test of whether the results extend to large human populations. Project Narrative The public health relevance of this proposal is that it will provide an infrastructure for analyzing impacts of dietary components and microbiomes throughout the body. The analysis of these maps will help us identify dietary components that improve resistance to infectious disease.",Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity,9785812,DP1AT010885,"['3-Dimensional', 'American', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Back', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consumption', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dietary Component', 'Disease Resistance', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratory Study', 'Liquid substance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Microbe', 'Minerals', 'Miniaturization', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutritional status', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phytochemical', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Robot', 'Sampling', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Vitamins', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'human subject', 'immunological status', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'microbiome', 'mouse model', 'nanolitre scale', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'side effect', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCCIH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",DP1,2019,1085000,0.020955071515438396
"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"Network modeling and robust estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient to inform the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials for infectious diseases 7. Project Summary/Abstract There is an urgent need to support research that generates high-quality evidence to inform clinical decision making. Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) achieve the highest standard of evidence for the evaluation of community-level effectiveness of intervention strategies against infectious diseases. However, there is a need to develop new methods to improve the design and analysis of CRTs because unique and complicated analytical challenges arise in such settings. One such issue relates to the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the degree to which individuals within a community are more similar to one another than to individuals in other communities. Design and analysis of CRTs must take into account the ICC. Lack of accurate information on the ICC jeopardizes the power of CRTs, leads to suboptimal choices of analysis methods and complicates the interpretation of study results. However, reliable information on the ICC is difficult to obtain. A robust and efficient approach for estimating ICCs is based on the second-order generalizing estimating equations. However, its use has been limited by considerable computational burden and poor convergence rates associated with the existing algorithms solving these equations. The first aim addresses these computational challenges. Missing data are ubiquitous and can lead to bias and loss of efficiency. The second aim proposes to develop novel robust and efficient methods for estimating ICCs in the presence of informative missing data. For infectious diseases, the underlying contact/transmission networks give rise to complicated correlation structure. The third aim is to develop network and epidemic models to project the ICC. User-friendly software will be developed to facilitate the implementation of new methods. An immediate application of the proposed methods is their application to the Botswana Combination Prevention Project to improve the estimation of intervention effect and to generate reliable ICC estimates for designing future CRTs in the same population. The proposed methods can be applied to other ongoing and future CRTs, and more broadly, to longitudinal studies and agreement studies where ICCs are also of great interest. The proposed research is significant, because success in addressing these issues will improve the ability to design efficient and well-powered CRTs and the precision in estimating the effects of intervention strategies. Innovation lies in the development of improved computing algorithms adapting approaches from deep learning, the use of semiparametric efficiency theory, and the integration of network modeling, epidemic modeling and statistical inference. The results of the proposed research will benefit both ongoing and future CRTs, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately expedite the control of infectious diseases. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because improved methodologies for the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials will benefit both ongoing and future studies, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately improve public health response intended to control the spread of infectious diseases.

"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist.

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat.

"An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. Project Summary / Abstract Diagnostic errors are increasingly recognized as a cause of pain, suffering and increased healthcare costs. Diagnostic delays are an important class of diagnostic errors. While many diagnostic errors occur in hospital settings, emergency departments visits may be especially important to consider because they treat critically ill patients and because most decisions to admit patients to the hospital are made in emergency departments. Thus, to enable a more complete understanding of diagnostic delays requires consideration of healthcare visits across a range of healthcare settings including clinic visits, emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Delays in diagnosing infectious diseases are important to consider. For contagious infectious diseases, diagnostic delays increase the risk of additional exposures, potentially generating more cases. Second, many infectious diseases can be effectively treated, but even short delays in treatment lead to worse clinical outcomes. However, with the exception of a few infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis), diagnostic delays for infectious diseases are understudied. Thus, there is a critical need to investigate the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact for diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. The overarching goal of our research is to investigate diagnostic delays associated with infectious diseases using existing data along with methods from the fields of computer science and statistics. While our research relies upon “big data”, we will also use clinical experts to review and contribute to all of our results. Our subject matter experts incorporate expertise in infectious diseases, emergency medicine, acute care, medical education, diagnostic reasoning, healthcare epidemiology, public health, industry, and professional infectious disease societies. Specifically, we will 1) determine the incidence of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases; 2) identify the risk factors associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases that are frequently delayed or have serious outcomes; and 3) estimate the impact of diagnostic delays in terms of healthcare costs and mortality. With our data, methods and clinical experts, we will be able to translate our results into future interventions designed to decrease diagnostic delays and improve healthcare outcomes. In addition, while our proposal focuses on infectious diseases, the methods and approaches that we will develop can be adopted to investigate non-infectious diseases and conditions. Project Narrative Diagnostic delays for infectious diseases contribute to worse clinical outcomes, increased healthcare costs and, for some infectious diseases, outbreaks of great public health importance. We will use existing large data sets along with machine-learning techniques and expert clinical guidance to detect patterns of healthcare visits representing diagnostic delays. Our goal is to characterize the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases to inform future interventions.","An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases.",9938200,R01HS027375,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2019,497273,0.07306584783996994
"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.

"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities. Pollinators serve a critical role in our native ecosystems as well as agricultural crops, providing billions of dollars in pollination services annually. Recently, parasites have been linked to declines of several pollinator species. Thus, a better understanding of parasite transmission among bees has important conservation and economic implications.",Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities,9530668,R01GM122062,"['Address', 'Agricultural Crops', 'Angiosperms', 'Bees', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Disease model', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Organism', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'economic implication', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'network models', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vector']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,584485,0.032201423362246434

As the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases, development of the next-generation vaccines is faced with the bottleneck that traditional empirical design becomes ineffective to stimulate human protective immunity against HIV, RSV, CMV, and other recent major public health threats. This project will focus on three important aspects of informatics approaches to secondary analysis of ImmPort data for influenza vaccination research: a) expanding the data analytical capabilities of ImmPort and ImmPortGalaxy through adding innovative computational methods for user-friendly unsupervised identification of cell populations, b) processing and analyzing a subset of the existing human influenza vaccination study data in ImmPort to identify cell-based biomarkers using the new computational methods, and c) returning data analysis results with data analytical provenance to ImmPort for dissemination of derived data, software tools, as well as semantic assertions of the identified biomarkers. Each aspect is one specific research aim in the proposed work. The project outcome will not only demonstrate the utility of the ImmPort data archive but also generate a foundation for the Human Vaccine Project (HVP) to establish pilot programs for influenza vaccine research, which currently include Vanderbilt University Medical Center; University of California San Diego (UCSD); Scripps Research Institute; La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology; and J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI). Once such computational analytical workflow is established, it can be applied to the secondary analysis of other ImmPort studies as well as to support the user-driven analytics of their own cytometry data. Each of the specific aims contains innovative methods or new applications of the existing methods. The computational method for population identification in Aim 1 is a newly developed constrained data clustering method, which combines advantages of unsupervised and supervised learning. Cutting-edge machine learning approaches including random forest will be used in Aim 2 for the identification of biomarkers across study cohorts, in addition to the traditional statistical hypothesis testing. Standardized knowledge representation to be developed in Aim 3 for cell-based biomarkers is also innovative, as semantic networks with inferring and deriving capabilities can be built based on the machine-readable knowledge assertions. The proposed work, when accomplished, will foster broader collaboration between ImmPort and the existing vaccine research consortia. It will also accelerate the deployment of up-to-date informatics software tools on ImmPortGalaxy. Project Narrative Flow cytometry (FCM) plays important roles in human influenza vaccination studies through interrogating immune cellular functions and quantifying the immune responses in different conditions. This project will extend the current data analytical capabilities of the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) through adding novel data analytical methods and software tools for user-friendly identification of cell populations from FCM data in ImmPort influenza vaccine response studies. The derived data and the knowledge generated from the secondary analysis of the ImmPort vaccination study data will be deposited back to ImmPort and shared with the Human Vaccines Project (HVP) consortium for dissemination.",Reproducible Analytics for Secondary Analyses of ImmPort Vaccination-Related Cytometry Data,9577591,UH2AI132342,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Archives', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Failure', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HIV', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Maps', 'Measles', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mumps', 'Names', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Population', 'Population Statistics', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readability', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Institute', 'Research Project Grants', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines', 'Respiratory syncytial virus', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Semantics', 'Smallpox', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker identification', 'catalyst', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized tools', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data portal', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'immune function', 'improved', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'neoplastic', 'news', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel vaccines', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public-private partnership', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'secondary analysis', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial', 'vaccine-induced immunity']",NIAID,"J.

"Vaccine Beliefs and Decision Making Project Summary This project will use methods from quantitative anthropology to describe the social space of vaccine beliefs that circulate among the general public and to provide an initial assessment of how different belief variations influence decisions to vaccinate. The results will establish, for the first time, the patterns of co-variation in the wide variety of pro- and anti- vaccine beliefs, and which axes of this variation appear associated with decisions to vaccinate. Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but the lay public largely does not fully appreciate scientific evidence when making decisions for or against vaccination. Understanding the inter-correlations of these beliefs, therefore, is imperative for designing effective educational interventions that can directly interface with the cultural beliefs that surround vaccination and influence the public's decision making on this issue. The project will leverage insights from two very different but complementary data sources: responses to a nationally representative survey (fielded on the RAND American Life Panel) and social media data from Twitter. Our analytic approach will begin with systematic coding techniques from mixed-methods research to classify vaccine beliefs into a comprehensive set of belief variants. Manual coding will be validated through inter-observer reliability checks and replicated at scale with machine-learning algorithms. Having systematically coded the data, we will then assess whether nationally representative survey data and data mined from Twitter produce similar results using Cultural Consensus Analysis, a technique from quantitative cultural anthropology. From the survey data we will test whether vaccine beliefs are correlated with decisions to vaccinate after controlling for demographic attributes. To ensure completion of this innovative and methodologically expansive project, the project team combines expertise from anthropology, decision science, clinical medicine, and biomathematics. The principal investigator brings to this project multiple years of both academic and industry experience in statistical modelling of cultural data. Project Narrative Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but patients' vaccination decisions may be more influenced by broadly circulated cultural beliefs than they are influenced by scientific evidence. This proposed research will systematically map the diversity of the publics' vaccination beliefs, assess how these beliefs influence vaccination decisions, and advise policy makers how to interface more directly with these popular belief systems that are critical to effective vaccination efforts.",Vaccine Beliefs and Decision Making,9557573,R21HD087749,"['Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anthropology', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Belief System', 'Childhood', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Cultural Anthropology', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Educational Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fright', 'General Population', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Immunization', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measles', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Work', 'authority', 'biomathematics', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'prevent', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social space', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'vaccine safety']",NICHD,RAND CORPORATION,R21,2018,242266,0.0429768535784716
"Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity PROJECT SUMMARY Reliable and real-time municipality-level predictive modeling and forecasts of infectious disease activity have the potential to transform the way public health decision-makers design interventions such as information campaigns, preemptive/reactive vaccinations, and vector control, in the presence of health threats across the world. While the links between disease activity and factors such as: human mobility, climate and environmental factors, socio-economic determinants, and social media activity have long been known in the epidemic literature, few efforts have focused on the evident need of developing an open-source platform capable of leveraging multiple data sources, factors, and disparate modeling methodologies, across a large and heterogeneous nation to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over four geographic scales (nation, state, city, and municipal). The overall goal of this project is to develop such a platform. Our long-term goal is to investigate effective ways to incorporate the findings from multiple disparate studies on disease dynamics around the globe with local and global factors such as weather conditions, socio- economic status, satellite imagery and online human behavior, to develop an operational, robust, and real- time data-driven disease forecasting platform. The objective of this grant is to leverage the expertise of three complementary scientific research teams and a wealth of information from a diverse array of data sources to build a modeling platform capable of combining information to produce real-time short term disease forecasts at the local level. As part of this, we will evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales--nation, state, city, and municipality--using Brazil as a test case. Additionally, we will use machine learning and mechanistic models to understand disease dynamics at multiple spatial scales, across a heterogeneous country such as Brazil. Our specific aims will (1) Assess the utility of individual data streams and modeling techniques for disease forecasting; (2) Fuse modeling techniques and data streams to improve accuracy and robustness at the four spatial scales; (3) Characterize the basic computational infrastructure necessary to build an operational disease forecasting platform; and (4) Validate our approach in a real-world setting. This contribution is significant because It will advance our scientific knowledge on the accuracy and limitations of disparate data streams and multiple modeling approaches when used to forecast disease transmission. Our efforts will help produce operational and systematic disease forecasts at a local level (city- and municipality-level). Moreover, we aim at building a new open-source computational platform for the epidemiological community to use as a knowledge discovery tool. Finally, we aim at developing this platform under the guidance of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) panel comprising of WHO, CDC, academics, and local and federal stakeholders within Brazil. The proposed approach is innovative because few efforts have focused on developing an open-source computational platform capable of combining disparate data sources and drivers, across a heterogeneous and large nation, into multiple modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over multiple geographic scales.. In addition, we propose to investigate how to best combine modeling approaches that have, to this date, been developed and interpreted independently, namely, traditional epidemiological mechanistic models and novel machine-learning predictive models, in order to produce accurate and robust real-time disease activity estimates and forecasts. Project Narrative The proposed research is of crucial importance to public health surveillance and preparedness communities because it seeks to identify effective ways to utilize previously disconnected results, that have pointed out links between disease spread and factors such as socio-economic status, local weather conditions, human mobility, social media activity, to build an open-source and data driven, modeling platform capable of extracting and disseminating information from disparate data sources, and complementary modeling approaches, to (1) Evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales: nation, state, city, and municipality; (2) Fuse complementary modeling approaches that have been developed independently and oftentimes not used in conjunction; (3) produce real- time and short term forecasts of disease activity in multiple geographic scales across a heterogeneous and large nation like Brazil.",Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity,9639469,R01GM130668,"['Area', 'Assimilations', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Brazil', 'Burn injury', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dengue', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Municipalities', 'Population Surveillance', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stream', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Water', 'Weather', 'Work', 'Zika Virus', 'base', 'chikungunya', 'climate variability', 'computer infrastructure', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'experience', 'flu', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'social media', 'socioeconomics', 'spreading factor', 'therapy design', 'time use', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,407175,0.02816458480719277
"Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease Challenge, Innovation and Impact: In recent years, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to predict epidemic disease outbreaks from retrospective seasonal and geographical case data and to show that we can take climate factors into account in our predictive models. We are moving closer to real-time prediction at the population level. But we have never used prediction at point-of-care for treating the individual patient.  Presently, personalized medicine uses delayed results of laboratory testing of individuals. For infectious disease, most of such testing has targeted the pathogen in the host-pathogen interaction. The role of laboratory testing is to modify therapy after a variable period of time delay. Personalized medicine today is reactive. Complicating matters further, many infectious epidemic diseases are strongly dependent on environmental factors and climate. Lastly, we want to name the pathogens we are fighting, but we really need to know the resistance characteristics to select therapy for patients effectively. Both speciation and resistance can now be determined from molecular data, which can be integrated into point-of-care treatment predictions.  We here propose a radically different approach to the treatment of infectious diseases. Our hypothesis is that the alternative to time-delayed and expensive laboratory analysis of specimens from individual patients, is to use predictive modeling to forecast point-of-care treatment. Time-delayed personalized testing can be conducted as surveillance, and that data used for real-time prediction to guide point-of-care treatment.  We will introduce predictive personalized public health (P3H) policy at the individual patient level, with the potential to substantially improve patient outcomes compared with our present reactive approaches. Our key rationale is to expand population infectious disease predictive modeling in order to achieve prediction for treatment at point-of-care. Our primary insight is that we can reposition the delayed reactive personalized testing from the urgent medical decision-making process, and into a predictive modeling framework. The gaps and opportunities in technology that we will address are four-fold. First, we will employ individual case geospatial mapping at a fine scale to take into account infection spread and environmental factors. Second, our ability to perform pan-microbial analysis using molecular techniques is now feasible. Third, modeling our novel fusion of data has no simple low-dimensional solution – but machine learning technologies are now capable of handling such big data assimilation, model discovery and prediction. Fourth, our proposal is not an academic exercise. We have a partnership with the economic planners within a developing country to design and implement our new methods. We will prospectively tune and validate our algorithms in real-time. Our deliverable will be an open-source framework ready for clinical trials testing and adaptation to the public health infrastructure in any country. Project Narrative We have made substantial progress in our abilities to track and predict infectious disease epidemics at the population level, but prediction has never been used at the individual level to guide treatment at point-of-care. The individual treatment for all infectious disease syndromes at point-of-care is presently empirical, because laboratory testing is reactive and time delayed. We here propose a novel framework to use rigorous prediction strategies to guide point-of-care treatment for infectious diseases, and to validate this approach under real-world conditions.",Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease,9566413,R01AI145057,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Assimilations', 'Bacterial Meningitis', 'Bacteriology', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cholera', 'Climate', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Exanthema', 'Exercise', 'Fever', 'Frequencies', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Hand', 'Health Policy', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Leptospirosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measles', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Melioidosis', 'Meningitis', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Newborn Infant', 'Paralysed', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uganda', 'Work', 'acute infection', 'antimicrobial', 'authority', 'climate data', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'fighting', 'flu', 'global health', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infectious disease model', 'infectious disease treatment', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'resistance gene', 'spreading factor', 'surveillance data']",NIAID,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2018,1527723,0.05457493493892239
"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,9487840,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'low income country', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2018,141048,0.051136531597803354
"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",9495704,U01GM110721,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronavirus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Economics', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunological Models', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Middle East', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Movement', 'Natural History', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'age group', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'contextual factors', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiological model', 'forest', 'genetic evolution', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel virus', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'public health relevance', 'resistant strain', 'seasonal influenza', 'simulation', 'social', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,U OF L IMPERIAL COL OF SCI/TECHNLGY/MED,U01,2018,396544,0.09022308773367738
"Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tracking evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread often requires the use of data deposited in public databases such as GenBank, the Influenza Research Database (IRD), or the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR). GenBank provides an abundance of available viral sequence data for phylogeography. Sequences and their metadata can be downloaded and imported into software applications that generate phylogeographic trees and models for surveillance. IRD and ViPR are NIH/NIAID funded programs that import data from GenBank but contain additional data sources, visualization, and search tools for their users. Tracking evolutionary changes and spread also requires the geospatial assignment of taxa, which is often obtained from GenBank metadata. Unfortunately, geospatial metadata such as host location is often uncertain in GenBank entries, with only 36% containing a precise location such as a county, town, or region within a state. For example, information such as China or USA was indicated instead of Beijing or Bedford, NH. While town or county might be included in the corresponding journal article, this valuable information is not available for immediate use unless it is extracted and then linked back to the appropriate sequence. The goal of our work is to enable health agencies and other researchers to automatically generate phylogeographic models that incorporate enhanced geospatial data for better estimates of virus spread. This proposal focuses on developing and applying information extraction and statistical phylogeography approaches to enhance models that track evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread. We propose a framework that uses natural language processing (NLP) for the automatic extraction of relevant geospatial data from the literature, and assigns a confidence between such geospatial mentions and the GenBank record. We will then use these locations and the estimates as observation error in the creation of phylogeographic models of zoonotic virus spread. We hypothesize that a combined NLP-phylogeography infrastructure that produces models that include observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa will be closer to a gold standard than phylogeographic models that do not include them. Our research will extend phylogeography and zoonotic surveillance by: creating a NLP infrastructure that will improve the level of detail of geospatial data for phylogeography of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1), develop phylogeographic models using the estimates from Aim 1 as observation error (Aim 2), and evaluating our approach by comparing the models it produces to models that do not account for observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa (Aim 3). We will allow users to generate enhanced models and view results on a web portal accessible via a LinkOut feature from GenBank, IRD, and ViPR. The addition of more precise geospatial information in building such models could enable health agencies to better target areas that represent the greatest public health risk. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop and evaluate an infrastructure that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify more precise geographic information for modeling spread of zoonotic viruses. These new models could enable public health agencies to identify the most at-risk areas. In addition, by improving geospatial information in popular sequence databases such as GenBank, we will enrich other sciences that utilize this information such as molecular epidemiology, population genetics, and environmental health.",Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error,9454246,R01AI117011,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'China', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Environmental Health', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Genbank', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hantavirus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Influenza', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Manuals', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nucleotides', 'Population Genetics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'RNA Viruses', 'Rabies', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Source', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'System', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'improved', 'information model', 'interest', 'journal article', 'molecular sequence database', 'pathogen', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2018,461012,0.01158605572435621
"Dynamic learning for post-vaccine event prediction using temporal information in VAERS Project Summary Vaccines have been one of the most successful public health interventions to date. They are, however, pharmaceutical products that carry risks. Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine- preventable illnesses. The CDC/FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) contains up to 30,000 reports per year over the past 25 years. VAERS reports include both structured data (e.g., vaccination date, first onset date, age, and gender) and unstructured narratives that often provide detailed clinical information about the clinical events and the temporal relationship of the series of event occurrences post vaccination. The structured data only provide one onsite date whereas temporal information of the sequence of events post vaccination is contained in the unstructured narratives. Current status –While structured data in the VAERS are widely used, the narratives are generally ignored because of the challenges inherent in working with unstructured data. Without these narratives, potentially valuable information is lost. Goals - In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs. Specifically, built upon the state-of-art ontology and natural language processing technologies, we will develop and validate a Temporal Information Modeling, Extraction and Reasoning system for Vaccine data (TIMER-V), which will automatically extract post-vaccination events and their temporal relationships from VAERS reports, semantically infer temporal relations, and integrate the exacted unstructured data with the structured data. Furthermore, we will provide and maintain a publicly available data access interface to query the new integrated data repository, which will facilitate vaccine safety research, casual inference, and other temporal related discovery. We will also develop and validate models to predict severe AEs using the co-occurrence or temporal patterns of the series of AEs post vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to make use of the unstructured narratives in the VAERS reports to facilitate the temporal related discovery to a broad community of investigators in pharmacology, pharmacoepidemiology, vaccine safety research, among others. Project Narrative Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine-preventable illnesses. In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. Currently the FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) only includes one onsite date in its database. The textual narratives in the reports are generally ignored primarily due to their unstructured nature. These narratives, however, contain more detailed information about the series of events that happened after vaccination, which could be valuable for more informed clinical studies. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs.

"Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There has been a tremendous focus in bioinformatics on translation of data from the bench into information and knowledge for clinical decision-making. This includes analysis of human genetics for personalized medicine and treatment. However, there has been much less attention on translational bioinformatics for public health practice such as surveillance of emerging/re-emerging viruses. This involves data acquisition, integration, and analyses of viral genetics to infer origin, spread, and evolution suc as the emergence of new strains. The relevant scientific fields for this practice include certain aspects of molecular epidemiology and phylogeography. Recent attention has focused on viruses of zoonotic origin, which are defined as pathogens that are transmittable between animals and humans. In addition to seasonal influenza and West Nile virus, this classification of pathogens includes novel viruses such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and influenza A H7N9. Despite the successes highlighted in the literature, there has been little utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools among state public health, agriculture, and wildlife agencies for zoonotic surveillance. Previously this type of resource has been restricted primarily to those in academia.       While bioinformatics has been sparsely used for surveillance of zoonotic viruses, other applications such as Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) have been employed by state health agencies to analyze spatial patterns of infection. This includes software to produce disease maps using an array of data types such as clinical, geographical, or human mobility data for tasks such as, geocoding, clustering, or outbreak detection. In addition, advances in geospatial statistics have enabled health agencies to perform more powerful space-time analyses to infer spatiotemporal patterns. However, these GIS consider only traditional epidemiological data such as location and timing of reported cases and not the genetics of the virus that causes the disease. This prevents health agencies from understanding how changes in the genome of the virus and the associated environment in which it disseminates impacts disease risk.      The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the identification of geospatial hotspots of zoonotic viruses by applying bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics and spatiotemporal reportable disease data. This project will include approaches from bioinformatics, genetics, spatial statistics, GIS, and epidemiology. To do this, I will first measue the utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools as well as the current approaches and limitations identified by state agencies of public health, agriculture, and wildlife for detecting nd predicting hotspots (clusters) of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1). I will then use this feedback to develo a spatial decision support system for detecting and predicting zoonotic hotspots that applies bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics, environmental, and spatiotemporal reportable disease data (Aim 2). In Aim 3, I will then evaluate my system for cluster detection and prediction against a system that does not consider viral genetics and relies on traditional spatiotemporal data, and perform validation of the predictive capability. Additional evaluation of the user's satisfaction and system usability will be evaluated. Project Narrative I will develop and evaluate a spatial decision support system to support surveillance of zoonotic viruses in both human and animal populations. I will use approaches from bioinformatics and public health to integrate genetic sequence data from the virus with data from cases of reported infectious diseases and associated environmental data. A surveillance system that considers the genetics and environment of the virus along with public health data will assist public health officials in making informed decisions regarding risk of infectious diseases.",Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance,9406513,F31LM012176,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biodiversity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Notification', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Ecology', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Genbank', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Questionnaire Designs', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Integration', 'West Nile virus', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'bioinformatics resource', 'clinical decision-making', 'data acquisition', 'data warehouse', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'health data', 'high risk', 'novel virus', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'satisfaction', 'seasonal influenza', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'virus classification', 'virus genetics']",NLM,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2018,40590,0.04867797651213649
"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"Network modeling and robust estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient to inform the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials for infectious diseases 7. Project Summary/Abstract There is an urgent need to support research that generates high-quality evidence to inform clinical decision making. Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) achieve the highest standard of evidence for the evaluation of community-level effectiveness of intervention strategies against infectious diseases. However, there is a need to develop new methods to improve the design and analysis of CRTs because unique and complicated analytical challenges arise in such settings. One such issue relates to the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the degree to which individuals within a community are more similar to one another than to individuals in other communities. Design and analysis of CRTs must take into account the ICC. Lack of accurate information on the ICC jeopardizes the power of CRTs, leads to suboptimal choices of analysis methods and complicates the interpretation of study results. However, reliable information on the ICC is difficult to obtain. A robust and efficient approach for estimating ICCs is based on the second-order generalizing estimating equations. However, its use has been limited by considerable computational burden and poor convergence rates associated with the existing algorithms solving these equations. The first aim addresses these computational challenges. Missing data are ubiquitous and can lead to bias and loss of efficiency. The second aim proposes to develop novel robust and efficient methods for estimating ICCs in the presence of informative missing data. For infectious diseases, the underlying contact/transmission networks give rise to complicated correlation structure. The third aim is to develop network and epidemic models to project the ICC. User-friendly software will be developed to facilitate the implementation of new methods. An immediate application of the proposed methods is their application to the Botswana Combination Prevention Project to improve the estimation of intervention effect and to generate reliable ICC estimates for designing future CRTs in the same population. The proposed methods can be applied to other ongoing and future CRTs, and more broadly, to longitudinal studies and agreement studies where ICCs are also of great interest. The proposed research is significant, because success in addressing these issues will improve the ability to design efficient and well-powered CRTs and the precision in estimating the effects of intervention strategies. Innovation lies in the development of improved computing algorithms adapting approaches from deep learning, the use of semiparametric efficiency theory, and the integration of network modeling, epidemic modeling and statistical inference. The results of the proposed research will benefit both ongoing and future CRTs, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately expedite the control of infectious diseases. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because improved methodologies for the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials will benefit both ongoing and future studies, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately improve public health response intended to control the spread of infectious diseases. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIAID’s mission that pertains to conducting and supporting research to prevent infectious diseases and to respond to emerging public health threats.",Network modeling and robust estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient to inform the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials for infectious diseases,9661636,R01AI136947,"['AIDS prevention', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Botswana', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ebola virus', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Epidemic', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'collaboratory', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'high standard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'novel', 'prevent', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'success', 'systems research', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'user friendly software']",NIAID,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R01,2018,263913,0.08365198074229442
"Protective biomarkers for the development of novel serotype-independent protein-based vaccine candidates against pneumococcus Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is the most common cause of severe pneumonia, and, despite the existence of licensed vaccines, annually kills half of a million children under five years old worldwide. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have the intrinsic disadvantage of a limited number of serotypes against which they provide protection, resulting in disease due to serotype replacement that reduces their impact. A protein-based vaccine could be used alone or in combination with PCVs to provide protection against all pneumococcal types in low and middle income, as well as developed countries. Antigen Discovery, Inc (ADI) of Irvine, California has developed a S. pneumoniae pan-proteome microarray, with coverage of both the core and accessory geneome, which can be used to screen antibody responses against the entire pneumococcal proteome. A proteome-scale platform for antibody immune-profiling has never before been available to the pneumococcus research community, and this technology has the power to rapidly advance our understanding of the protective immune response directed to pneumococcal proteins. The Respiratory Infections Group (RIG) at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) in the U.K. has developed a unique human model, which allows for the discovery of targets of naturally acquired and vaccine induced immunity against nasal colonization with pneumococci. In the Experimental Human Pneumococcal Carriage (EHPC) model, healthy volunteers are inoculated with a pneumococcal challenge strain, and acquisition of the challenge strain (carriage-positive) or protection from it (carriage-negative), as well as immune responses before and after challenge, are determined in mucosal secretions and peripheral blood. We will use pan-proteome microarrays to measure the anti-protein IgG and IgA levels to specific proteins before bacteria inoculation and associate these responses with protection from carriage using samples from the volunteers of EHPC trials. This tool will allow us to identify novel relevant protein targets that can be exploited as a part of a multi-component or monovalent vaccine. We expect to identify >200 immunoreactive protein targets, at least 10-20 of which are significantly associated with protection. We will attempt to prioritize 10 of the most promising candidate antigens to take forward for vaccine development.

"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist.

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9530648,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2018,220530,0.03357389230252023
"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This study is to develop and validate a genome based strategy for influenza vaccine strain selection, and it will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.",Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning,9205487,R01AI116744,"['Affect', 'Africa', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryo', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Hemagglutination', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immunology procedure', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scientist', 'Seasons', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Ships', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Production', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'candidate selection', 'egg', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'influenza surveillance', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'learning strategy', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,372603,0.05434684345500071
"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities. Pollinators serve a critical role in our native ecosystems as well as agricultural crops, providing billions of dollars in pollination services annually. Recently, parasites have been linked to declines of several pollinator species. Thus, a better understanding of parasite transmission among bees has important conservation and economic implications.",Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities,9355693,R01GM122062,"['Address', 'Agricultural Crops', 'Angiosperms', 'Bees', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Disease model', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Organism', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'economic implication', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'network models', 'novel', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vector']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,406785,0.032201423362246434
"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Vaccine Beliefs and Decision Making Project Summary This project will use methods from quantitative anthropology to describe the social space of vaccine beliefs that circulate among the general public and to provide an initial assessment of how different belief variations influence decisions to vaccinate. The results will establish, for the first time, the patterns of co-variation in the wide variety of pro- and anti- vaccine beliefs, and which axes of this variation appear associated with decisions to vaccinate. Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but the lay public largely does not fully appreciate scientific evidence when making decisions for or against vaccination. Understanding the inter-correlations of these beliefs, therefore, is imperative for designing effective educational interventions that can directly interface with the cultural beliefs that surround vaccination and influence the public's decision making on this issue. The project will leverage insights from two very different but complementary data sources: responses to a nationally representative survey (fielded on the RAND American Life Panel) and social media data from Twitter. Our analytic approach will begin with systematic coding techniques from mixed-methods research to classify vaccine beliefs into a comprehensive set of belief variants. Manual coding will be validated through inter-observer reliability checks and replicated at scale with machine-learning algorithms. Having systematically coded the data, we will then assess whether nationally representative survey data and data mined from Twitter produce similar results using Cultural Consensus Analysis, a technique from quantitative cultural anthropology. From the survey data we will test whether vaccine beliefs are correlated with decisions to vaccinate after controlling for demographic attributes. To ensure completion of this innovative and methodologically expansive project, the project team combines expertise from anthropology, decision science, clinical medicine, and biomathematics. The principal investigator brings to this project multiple years of both academic and industry experience in statistical modelling of cultural data. Project Narrative Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but patients' vaccination decisions may be more influenced by broadly circulated cultural beliefs than they are influenced by scientific evidence. This proposed research will systematically map the diversity of the publics' vaccination beliefs, assess how these beliefs influence vaccination decisions, and advise policy makers how to interface more directly with these popular belief systems that are critical to effective vaccination efforts.",Vaccine Beliefs and Decision Making,9241259,R21HD087749,"['Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anthropology', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Belief System', 'Childhood', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Cultural Anthropology', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Educational Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fright', 'General Population', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Immunization', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measles', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Work', 'authority', 'biomathematics', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'prevent', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social space', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'vaccine safety']",NICHD,RAND CORPORATION,R21,2017,239723,0.0429768535784716
"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,9275314,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'low income country', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2017,142177,0.051136531597803354
"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",9279143,U01GM110721,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronaviridae', 'Coronavirus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunological Models', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Middle East', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Movement', 'Natural History', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'age group', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'contextual factors', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiological model', 'forest', 'genetic evolution', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel virus', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'public health relevance', 'resistant strain', 'seasonal influenza', 'simulation', 'social', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,U OF L IMPERIAL COL OF SCI/TECHNLGY/MED,U01,2017,202814,0.09022308773367738
"Dynamic learning for post-vaccine event prediction using temporal information in VAERS Project Summary Vaccines have been one of the most successful public health interventions to date. They are, however, pharmaceutical products that carry risks. Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine- preventable illnesses. The CDC/FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) contains up to 30,000 reports per year over the past 25 years. VAERS reports include both structured data (e.g., vaccination date, first onset date, age, and gender) and unstructured narratives that often provide detailed clinical information about the clinical events and the temporal relationship of the series of event occurrences post vaccination. The structured data only provide one onsite date whereas temporal information of the sequence of events post vaccination is contained in the unstructured narratives. Current status –While structured data in the VAERS are widely used, the narratives are generally ignored because of the challenges inherent in working with unstructured data. Without these narratives, potentially valuable information is lost. Goals - In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs. Specifically, built upon the state-of-art ontology and natural language processing technologies, we will develop and validate a Temporal Information Modeling, Extraction and Reasoning system for Vaccine data (TIMER-V), which will automatically extract post-vaccination events and their temporal relationships from VAERS reports, semantically infer temporal relations, and integrate the exacted unstructured data with the structured data. Furthermore, we will provide and maintain a publicly available data access interface to query the new integrated data repository, which will facilitate vaccine safety research, casual inference, and other temporal related discovery. We will also develop and validate models to predict severe AEs using the co-occurrence or temporal patterns of the series of AEs post vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to make use of the unstructured narratives in the VAERS reports to facilitate the temporal related discovery to a broad community of investigators in pharmacology, pharmacoepidemiology, vaccine safety research, among others. Project Narrative Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine-preventable illnesses. In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. Currently the FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) only includes one onsite date in its database. The textual narratives in the reports are generally ignored primarily due to their unstructured nature. These narratives, however, contain more detailed information about the series of events that happened after vaccination, which could be valuable for more informed clinical studies. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs. Our new methods, their applications to VAERS database, and their dissemination will facilitate the entire research network for pursuing temporal related discovery with high methodological rigor.",Dynamic learning for post-vaccine event prediction using temporal information in VAERS,9290660,R01AI130460,"['Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Severe Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'base', 'data access', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'information model', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'public health intervention', 'response', 'vaccine safety']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2017,644888,0.040508011479238104
"Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tracking evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread often requires the use of data deposited in public databases such as GenBank, the Influenza Research Database (IRD), or the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR). GenBank provides an abundance of available viral sequence data for phylogeography. Sequences and their metadata can be downloaded and imported into software applications that generate phylogeographic trees and models for surveillance. IRD and ViPR are NIH/NIAID funded programs that import data from GenBank but contain additional data sources, visualization, and search tools for their users. Tracking evolutionary changes and spread also requires the geospatial assignment of taxa, which is often obtained from GenBank metadata. Unfortunately, geospatial metadata such as host location is often uncertain in GenBank entries, with only 36% containing a precise location such as a county, town, or region within a state. For example, information such as China or USA was indicated instead of Beijing or Bedford, NH. While town or county might be included in the corresponding journal article, this valuable information is not available for immediate use unless it is extracted and then linked back to the appropriate sequence. The goal of our work is to enable health agencies and other researchers to automatically generate phylogeographic models that incorporate enhanced geospatial data for better estimates of virus spread. This proposal focuses on developing and applying information extraction and statistical phylogeography approaches to enhance models that track evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread. We propose a framework that uses natural language processing (NLP) for the automatic extraction of relevant geospatial data from the literature, and assigns a confidence between such geospatial mentions and the GenBank record. We will then use these locations and the estimates as observation error in the creation of phylogeographic models of zoonotic virus spread. We hypothesize that a combined NLP-phylogeography infrastructure that produces models that include observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa will be closer to a gold standard than phylogeographic models that do not include them. Our research will extend phylogeography and zoonotic surveillance by: creating a NLP infrastructure that will improve the level of detail of geospatial data for phylogeography of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1), develop phylogeographic models using the estimates from Aim 1 as observation error (Aim 2), and evaluating our approach by comparing the models it produces to models that do not account for observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa (Aim 3). We will allow users to generate enhanced models and view results on a web portal accessible via a LinkOut feature from GenBank, IRD, and ViPR. The addition of more precise geospatial information in building such models could enable health agencies to better target areas that represent the greatest public health risk. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop and evaluate an infrastructure that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify more precise geographic information for modeling spread of zoonotic viruses. These new models could enable public health agencies to identify the most at-risk areas. In addition, by improving geospatial information in popular sequence databases such as GenBank, we will enrich other sciences that utilize this information such as molecular epidemiology, population genetics, and environmental health.",Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error,9249484,R01AI117011,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'China', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Environmental Health', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Genbank', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hantavirus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Influenza', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Manuals', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nucleotides', 'Population Genetics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'RNA Viruses', 'Rabies', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Source', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'System', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'improved', 'information model', 'interest', 'journal article', 'molecular sequence database', 'pathogen', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2017,461012,0.01158605572435621
"Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There has been a tremendous focus in bioinformatics on translation of data from the bench into information and knowledge for clinical decision-making. This includes analysis of human genetics for personalized medicine and treatment. However, there has been much less attention on translational bioinformatics for public health practice such as surveillance of emerging/re-emerging viruses. This involves data acquisition, integration, and analyses of viral genetics to infer origin, spread, and evolution suc as the emergence of new strains. The relevant scientific fields for this practice include certain aspects of molecular epidemiology and phylogeography. Recent attention has focused on viruses of zoonotic origin, which are defined as pathogens that are transmittable between animals and humans. In addition to seasonal influenza and West Nile virus, this classification of pathogens includes novel viruses such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and influenza A H7N9. Despite the successes highlighted in the literature, there has been little utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools among state public health, agriculture, and wildlife agencies for zoonotic surveillance. Previously this type of resource has been restricted primarily to those in academia.       While bioinformatics has been sparsely used for surveillance of zoonotic viruses, other applications such as Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) have been employed by state health agencies to analyze spatial patterns of infection. This includes software to produce disease maps using an array of data types such as clinical, geographical, or human mobility data for tasks such as, geocoding, clustering, or outbreak detection. In addition, advances in geospatial statistics have enabled health agencies to perform more powerful space-time analyses to infer spatiotemporal patterns. However, these GIS consider only traditional epidemiological data such as location and timing of reported cases and not the genetics of the virus that causes the disease. This prevents health agencies from understanding how changes in the genome of the virus and the associated environment in which it disseminates impacts disease risk.      The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the identification of geospatial hotspots of zoonotic viruses by applying bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics and spatiotemporal reportable disease data. This project will include approaches from bioinformatics, genetics, spatial statistics, GIS, and epidemiology. To do this, I will first measue the utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools as well as the current approaches and limitations identified by state agencies of public health, agriculture, and wildlife for detecting nd predicting hotspots (clusters) of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1). I will then use this feedback to develo a spatial decision support system for detecting and predicting zoonotic hotspots that applies bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics, environmental, and spatiotemporal reportable disease data (Aim 2). In Aim 3, I will then evaluate my system for cluster detection and prediction against a system that does not consider viral genetics and relies on traditional spatiotemporal data, and perform validation of the predictive capability. Additional evaluation of the user's satisfaction and system usability will be evaluated.               Project Narrative I will develop and evaluate a spatial decision support system to support surveillance of zoonotic viruses in both human and animal populations. I will use approaches from bioinformatics and public health to integrate genetic sequence data from the virus with data from cases of reported infectious diseases and associated environmental data. A surveillance system that considers the genetics and environment of the virus along with public health data will assist public health officials in making informed decisions regarding risk of infectious diseases.",Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance,9189635,F31LM012176,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biodiversity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Notification', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecology', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Genbank', 'Genetic', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Questionnaire Designs', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Integration', 'West Nile virus', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'clinical decision-making', 'data acquisition', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'health data', 'high risk', 'novel virus', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'satisfaction', 'seasonal influenza', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'virus classification', 'virus genetics']",NLM,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2017,38800,0.04867797651213649
"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist.

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9326841,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'killings', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2017,225549,0.03357389230252023
"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.

"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities. Pollinators serve a critical role in our native ecosystems as well as agricultural crops, providing billions of dollars in pollination services annually. Recently, parasites have been linked to declines of several pollinator species. Thus, a better understanding of parasite transmission among bees has important conservation and economic implications.",Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities,9241579,R01GM122062,"['Address', 'Agricultural Crops', 'Angiosperms', 'Bees', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Organism', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'economic implication', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'model building', 'network models', 'novel', 'research study', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vector']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,409580,0.032201423362246434
"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels.

"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,9094553,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'low income country', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'research study', 'response', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2016,141588,0.051136531597803354
"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",9099895,U01GM110721,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronavirus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Middle East', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Movement', 'Natural History', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'age group', 'base', 'contextual factors', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiological model', 'forest', 'genetic evolution', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel virus', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'resistant strain', 'seasonal influenza', 'simulation', 'social', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,U OF L IMPERIAL COL OF SCI/TECHNLGY/MED,U01,2016,418572,0.09022308773367738
"Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tracking evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread often requires the use of data deposited in public databases such as GenBank, the Influenza Research Database (IRD), or the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR). GenBank provides an abundance of available viral sequence data for phylogeography. Sequences and their metadata can be downloaded and imported into software applications that generate phylogeographic trees and models for surveillance. IRD and ViPR are NIH/NIAID funded programs that import data from GenBank but contain additional data sources, visualization, and search tools for their users. Tracking evolutionary changes and spread also requires the geospatial assignment of taxa, which is often obtained from GenBank metadata. Unfortunately, geospatial metadata such as host location is often uncertain in GenBank entries, with only 36% containing a precise location such as a county, town, or region within a state. For example, information such as China or USA was indicated instead of Beijing or Bedford, NH. While town or county might be included in the corresponding journal article, this valuable information is not available for immediate use unless it is extracted and then linked back to the appropriate sequence. The goal of our work is to enable health agencies and other researchers to automatically generate phylogeographic models that incorporate enhanced geospatial data for better estimates of virus spread. This proposal focuses on developing and applying information extraction and statistical phylogeography approaches to enhance models that track evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread. We propose a framework that uses natural language processing (NLP) for the automatic extraction of relevant geospatial data from the literature, and assigns a confidence between such geospatial mentions and the GenBank record. We will then use these locations and the estimates as observation error in the creation of phylogeographic models of zoonotic virus spread. We hypothesize that a combined NLP-phylogeography infrastructure that produces models that include observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa will be closer to a gold standard than phylogeographic models that do not include them. Our research will extend phylogeography and zoonotic surveillance by: creating a NLP infrastructure that will improve the level of detail of geospatial data for phylogeography of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1), develop phylogeographic models using the estimates from Aim 1 as observation error (Aim 2), and evaluating our approach by comparing the models it produces to models that do not account for observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa (Aim 3). We will allow users to generate enhanced models and view results on a web portal accessible via a LinkOut feature from GenBank, IRD, and ViPR. The addition of more precise geospatial information in building such models could enable health agencies to better target areas that represent the greatest public health risk.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop and evaluate an infrastructure that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify more precise geographic information for modeling spread of zoonotic viruses. These new models could enable public health agencies to identify the most at-risk areas. In addition, by improving geospatial information in popular sequence databases such as GenBank, we will enrich other sciences that utilize this information such as molecular epidemiology, population genetics, and environmental health.                ",Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error,9065021,R01AI117011,"['Accounting', 'Animals', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'China', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Environmental Health', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Genbank', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hantavirus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Influenza', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nucleotides', 'Population Genetics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'RNA Viruses', 'Rabies', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Source', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'System', 'Taxon', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Work', 'improved', 'information model', 'interest', 'journal article', 'pathogen', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2016,479735,0.01158605572435621
"A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am trained as a computational biologist and statistician, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. My main career goal is to become an independent researcher at a major research institution. I plan to continue my current research pursuits in global health and infectious diseases. Specifically, I aim to continue developing mathematical and computational approaches for modeling to understand disease transmission, forecasting future dynamics and evaluating interventions for public policy decisions. As a postdoctoral research fellow, I have had the wonderful opportunity of working with data from multiple sources. Although several of these data streams could be labeled as ""Big Data"", I typically work with the data after it is already processed, filtered and aggregated to a daily or weekly resolution. While I have developed the necessary skills for modeling these already processed data, there are three important areas where I require additional training, mentoring, and experience: (1) advanced computational skills especially in the use of high performance computing and informatics tools, (2) techniques in computational machine learning and data mining necessary for data acquisition and processing, and (3) biostatistical methodology needed for the statistical design of studies involving big data. These three training and mentoring aims would enable me to develop the skills necessary to become an independent investigator in Big Data Science for biomedical research. Boston Children's School and Harvard Medical School are leading institutions in translational biomedical research, thereby making them the ideal environment to pursue the training and research aims in this proposal. The recent emergence of infectious diseases such as the avian influenza H7N9 in China, and re-emergence of diseases such as polio in Syria underscores the importance of strengthening immunization and emergency response programs for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Researchers have developed computational and mathematical models to capture determinants of infectious disease dynamics and identify factors that support prediction of these dynamics, provide estimates of disease risk, and evaluate various intervention scenarios. While these studies have been extremely useful for the understanding of infectious disease transmission and control, most have been disease specific and solely used data from traditional disease surveillance systems. In contrast, there is a huge amount of internet-based data that have been extensively assessed and validated for public health surveillance in the last decade, but it has been scarcely used in conjunction with other data sources for modeling to predict disease spread. Using these novel digital event-based data sources in combination with climate and case data from traditional disease surveillance systems, we will establish a much needed framework for integrating these disparate data sources for modeling to estimate disease risk and forecasting temporal dynamics of infectious diseases. Our approach will be achieved through three aims. The first objective is to develop an automated process for acquiring, processing and filtering data for modeling (Aim 1). Once we gather this data, we will develop temporal models for the dynamical assessment of the relationship between the various data variables and infectious disease incidence (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess the utility of the modeling approaches developed under Aim 2 for forecasting temporal trends of infectious diseases (Aim 3). Through data acquisition, thorough processing, statistical and epidemiological modeling, and guided by advisers with expertise in biomedical informatics, computer science and statistics, we plan to achieve a comprehensive approach to integrating multiple data streams for modeling to forecast infectious diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there have been significant medical and technological advances towards infectious disease prevention, surveillance and control, infectious diseases still account for an estimated 15 million deaths each year worldwide. Reliable forecasts of infectious disease dynamics can influence decisions regarding prioritization of limited resources during outbreaks, optimization of disease interventions and implementation of rigorous surveillance processes for quicker case identification and control of emerging disease outbreaks. Our goal is therefore to develop a data mining/informatics framework that leverages the huge amount of digital event-based data sources in combination with climate data, and data from traditional disease surveillance systems for modeling and forecasting infectious diseases.",A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases,9123353,K01ES025438,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza', 'Big Data', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Boston', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'China', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Emergency response', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Immunization', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Population Surveillance', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention program', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Syria', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'climate data', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiological model', 'experience', 'global health', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'mathematical model', 'medical schools', 'model building', 'news', 'novel', 'pandemic influenza', 'skills', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trend', 'web based interface']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K01,2016,107469,0.11414059402875582
"Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This computational research project will analyze gastrointestinal microbiome, host cellular immune response, and host transcriptional response datasets derived from a large-scale rhesus macaque AIDS vaccine study. The vaccine study includes 70 animals divided into five groups and is designed to test the efficacy of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) vector expressing the major simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) proteins. In previous studies, RhCMV/SIV vaccines elicit a robust effector-memory T cell response. After challenge with highly pathogenic SIVmac239, approximately 50% of RhCMV/SIV-vaccinated monkeys exhibit a pattern of viral control that is characterized by a ""blip"" of viremia followed by control of plasma viremia to undetectable levels. One to three years later, RhCMV/SIV-protected monkeys show no sign of SIV infection, suggesting immune-mediated clearance of the virus. The mechanisms responsible for this 50% efficacy are not clear, but may reflect T cell responses at the site of SIV entry or sites of early replication. Thi project will investigate the role of the gastrointestinal microbiome on RhCMV/SIV-induced effector-memory T cell responses and protection against SIVmac239 challenge. The project includes two computationally based Specific Aims: 1) Define the composition of the gut microbiome prior to and after vaccination and during repeated limiting-dose SIVmac239 challenge; and 2) Determine how the composition of the gut microbiome correlates with protective immune cell responses and vaccine-induced host transcriptional responses. In Aim 1, 16S ribosomal sequence data (obtained from rectal swabs) will be used to determine operational taxonomic units. Variation in bacterial species over time and within individual animals will be determined using Mothur and Qiime metagenomic software.  Nonparametric statistical analyses and co-occurrence and co-exclusion networks will be used to identify bacterial species associated with progression or control of SIV infection after repeated limiting-dose intrarectal SIVmac239 challenge. In Aim 2, principle component analysis will be used to identify associations between microbiome composition and SIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Gene module-based and correlation network-based approaches will be used to determine associations between microbiome composition and host transcriptional responses (collected from whole blood samples). Together, these analyses will allow us to better understand microbiome-host interactions and their role in eliciting a protective vaccine-derived effector-memory T cell response. Such understanding will inform future vaccination strategies and attempts to modulate microbiome composition to affect vaccine efficacy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The types and numbers of bacterial species that live in the gastrointestinal tract (together known as the microbiome) affect many aspects of human health and disease, including how individuals respond to vaccination and viral infection. In this study, we will define the gastrointestinal microbiome of rhesus monkeys before and after vaccination with an experimental AIDS vaccine and after infection with a monkey immunodeficiency virus. This study will allow us to determine how the microbiome impacts the effectiveness of the vaccine and may suggest whether altering the microbiome may improve vaccine performance.",Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge,9267858,R21AI120713,"['AIDS Vaccines', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Blood specimen', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monkeys', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Network-based', 'Oregon', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'SIV', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Swab', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Viremia', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Washington', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'functional genomics', 'gut microbiome', 'improved', 'microbiome', 'nonhuman primate', 'professor', 'rectal', 'response', 'vaccination strategy', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'vector']",NIAID,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R21,2016,227250,0.005016786891308619
"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist. Our long-term objective is to apply enhanced understanding of adaptive immunity to accelerate the rational development of new vaccines and therapeutics.",Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression,9212615,DP5OD023118,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'B cell repertoire', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Convalescence', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'EBV-associated disease', 'Ensure', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Herpesviridae', 'Herpesviridae Infections', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Human', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Mononucleosis', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Large-Cell Immunoblastic Lymphoma', 'Lead', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nasopharynx Carcinoma', 'Oncogenic', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Primary Infection', 'Public Health', 'Questioning individuals', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell', 'Recovery', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Stomach Carcinoma', 'Symptoms', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder control', 'human disease', 'immune function', 'insight', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'neutralizing monoclonal antibodies', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'novel vaccines', 'pathogen', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'research study', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'treatment strategy', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine trial', 'virology', 'young adult']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,DP5,2016,369806,0.03672019701959523

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9147601,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'killings', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'personalized medicine', 'power analysis', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2016,49355,0.03357389230252023
"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This study is to develop and validate a genome based strategy for influenza vaccine strain selection, and it will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.                ",Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning,8859887,R01AI116744,"['Affect', 'Africa', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryo', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Hemagglutination', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scientist', 'Seasons', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Production', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'candidate selection', 'egg', 'flu', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'research study', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,381704,0.05434684345500071
"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.            ",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,8947064,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2015,142069,0.051136531597803354
"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",8927659,U01GM110721,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronavirus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Influenza A Virus', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Middle East', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Movement', 'Natural History', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'age group', 'base', 'contextual factors', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiological model', 'forest', 'genetic evolution', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel virus', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'resistant strain', 'seasonal influenza', 'simulation', 'social', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,U OF L IMPERIAL COL OF SCI/TECHNLGY/MED,U01,2015,434391,0.09022308773367738
"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health. Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases.

"A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am trained as a computational biologist and statistician, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. My main career goal is to become an independent researcher at a major research institution. I plan to continue my current research pursuits in global health and infectious diseases. Specifically, I aim to continue developing mathematical and computational approaches for modeling to understand disease transmission, forecasting future dynamics and evaluating interventions for public policy decisions. As a postdoctoral research fellow, I have had the wonderful opportunity of working with data from multiple sources. Although several of these data streams could be labeled as ""Big Data"", I typically work with the data after it is already processed, filtered and aggregated to a daily or weekly resolution. While I have developed the necessary skills for modeling these already processed data, there are three important areas where I require additional training, mentoring, and experience: (1) advanced computational skills especially in the use of high performance computing and informatics tools, (2) techniques in computational machine learning and data mining necessary for data acquisition and processing, and (3) biostatistical methodology needed for the statistical design of studies involving big data. These three training and mentoring aims would enable me to develop the skills necessary to become an independent investigator in Big Data Science for biomedical research. Boston Children's School and Harvard Medical School are leading institutions in translational biomedical research, thereby making them the ideal environment to pursue the training and research aims in this proposal. The recent emergence of infectious diseases such as the avian influenza H7N9 in China, and re-emergence of diseases such as polio in Syria underscores the importance of strengthening immunization and emergency response programs for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Researchers have developed computational and mathematical models to capture determinants of infectious disease dynamics and identify factors that support prediction of these dynamics, provide estimates of disease risk, and evaluate various intervention scenarios. While these studies have been extremely useful for the understanding of infectious disease transmission and control, most have been disease specific and solely used data from traditional disease surveillance systems. In contrast, there is a huge amount of internet-based data that have been extensively assessed and validated for public health surveillance in the last decade, but it has been scarcely used in conjunction with other data sources for modeling to predict disease spread. Using these novel digital event-based data sources in combination with climate and case data from traditional disease surveillance systems, we will establish a much needed framework for integrating these disparate data sources for modeling to estimate disease risk and forecasting temporal dynamics of infectious diseases. Our approach will be achieved through three aims. The first objective is to develop an automated process for acquiring, processing and filtering data for modeling (Aim 1). Once we gather this data, we will develop temporal models for the dynamical assessment of the relationship between the various data variables and infectious disease incidence (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess the utility of the modeling approaches developed under Aim 2 for forecasting temporal trends of infectious diseases (Aim 3). Through data acquisition, thorough processing, statistical and epidemiological modeling, and guided by advisers with expertise in biomedical informatics, computer science and statistics, we plan to achieve a comprehensive approach to integrating multiple data streams for modeling to forecast infectious diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there have been significant medical and technological advances towards infectious disease prevention, surveillance and control, infectious diseases still account for an estimated 15 million deaths each year worldwide. Reliable forecasts of infectious disease dynamics can influence decisions regarding prioritization of limited resources during outbreaks, optimization of disease interventions and implementation of rigorous surveillance processes for quicker case identification and control of emerging disease outbreaks. Our goal is therefore to develop a data mining/informatics framework that leverages the huge amount of digital event-based data sources in combination with climate data, and data from traditional disease surveillance systems for modeling and forecasting infectious diseases.            ",A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases,8935819,K01ES025438,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza', 'Big Data', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Boston', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'China', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Emergency response', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Immunization', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Population Surveillance', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention program', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Report (account)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Syria', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'climate data', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiological model', 'experience', 'global health', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'mathematical model', 'medical schools', 'model building', 'news', 'novel', 'pandemic influenza', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trend', 'web based interface']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K01,2015,107469,0.11414059402875582
"Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There has been a tremendous focus in bioinformatics on translation of data from the bench into information and knowledge for clinical decision-making. This includes analysis of human genetics for personalized medicine and treatment. However, there has been much less attention on translational bioinformatics for public health practice such as surveillance of emerging/re-emerging viruses. This involves data acquisition, integration, and analyses of viral genetics to infer origin, spread, and evolution suc as the emergence of new strains. The relevant scientific fields for this practice include certain aspects of molecular epidemiology and phylogeography. Recent attention has focused on viruses of zoonotic origin, which are defined as pathogens that are transmittable between animals and humans. In addition to seasonal influenza and West Nile virus, this classification of pathogens includes novel viruses such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and influenza A H7N9. Despite the successes highlighted in the literature, there has been little utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools among state public health, agriculture, and wildlife agencies for zoonotic surveillance. Previously this type of resource has been restricted primarily to those in academia.       While bioinformatics has been sparsely used for surveillance of zoonotic viruses, other applications such as Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) have been employed by state health agencies to analyze spatial patterns of infection. This includes software to produce disease maps using an array of data types such as clinical, geographical, or human mobility data for tasks such as, geocoding, clustering, or outbreak detection. In addition, advances in geospatial statistics have enabled health agencies to perform more powerful space-time analyses to infer spatiotemporal patterns. However, these GIS consider only traditional epidemiological data such as location and timing of reported cases and not the genetics of the virus that causes the disease. This prevents health agencies from understanding how changes in the genome of the virus and the associated environment in which it disseminates impacts disease risk.      The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the identification of geospatial hotspots of zoonotic viruses by applying bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics and spatiotemporal reportable disease data. This project will include approaches from bioinformatics, genetics, spatial statistics, GIS, and epidemiology. To do this, I will first measue the utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools as well as the current approaches and limitations identified by state agencies of public health, agriculture, and wildlife for detecting nd predicting hotspots (clusters) of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1). I will then use this feedback to develo a spatial decision support system for detecting and predicting zoonotic hotspots that applies bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics, environmental, and spatiotemporal reportable disease data (Aim 2). In Aim 3, I will then evaluate my system for cluster detection and prediction against a system that does not consider viral genetics and relies on traditional spatiotemporal data, and perform validation of the predictive capability. Additional evaluation of the user's satisfaction and system usability will be evaluated.               Project Narrative I will develop and evaluate a spatial decision support system to support surveillance of zoonotic viruses in both human and animal populations. I will use approaches from bioinformatics and public health to integrate genetic sequence data from the virus with data from cases of reported infectious diseases and associated environmental data. A surveillance system that considers the genetics and environment of the virus along with public health data will assist public health officials in making informed decisions regarding risk of infectious diseases.",Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance,9050106,F31LM012176,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biodiversity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecology', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Genbank', 'Genetic', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Questionnaire Designs', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Satellite Viruses', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'West Nile virus', 'Work', 'clinical decision-making', 'data acquisition', 'disorder risk', 'health data', 'high risk', 'novel virus', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'satisfaction', 'seasonal influenza', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'virus classification', 'virus genetics']",NLM,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2015,36613,0.04867797651213649
"Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This computational research project will analyze gastrointestinal microbiome, host cellular immune response, and host transcriptional response datasets derived from a large-scale rhesus macaque AIDS vaccine study. The vaccine study includes 70 animals divided into five groups and is designed to test the efficacy of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) vector expressing the major simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) proteins. In previous studies, RhCMV/SIV vaccines elicit a robust effector-memory T cell response. After challenge with highly pathogenic SIVmac239, approximately 50% of RhCMV/SIV-vaccinated monkeys exhibit a pattern of viral control that is characterized by a ""blip"" of viremia followed by control of plasma viremia to undetectable levels. One to three years later, RhCMV/SIV-protected monkeys show no sign of SIV infection, suggesting immune-mediated clearance of the virus. The mechanisms responsible for this 50% efficacy are not clear, but may reflect T cell responses at the site of SIV entry or sites of early replication. Thi project will investigate the role of the gastrointestinal microbiome on RhCMV/SIV-induced effector-memory T cell responses and protection against SIVmac239 challenge. The project includes two computationally based Specific Aims: 1) Define the composition of the gut microbiome prior to and after vaccination and during repeated limiting-dose SIVmac239 challenge; and 2) Determine how the composition of the gut microbiome correlates with protective immune cell responses and vaccine-induced host transcriptional responses. In Aim 1, 16S ribosomal sequence data (obtained from rectal swabs) will be used to determine operational taxonomic units. Variation in bacterial species over time and within individual animals will be determined using Mothur and Qiime metagenomic software.  Nonparametric statistical analyses and co-occurrence and co-exclusion networks will be used to identify bacterial species associated with progression or control of SIV infection after repeated limiting-dose intrarectal SIVmac239 challenge. In Aim 2, principle component analysis will be used to identify associations between microbiome composition and SIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Gene module-based and correlation network-based approaches will be used to determine associations between microbiome composition and host transcriptional responses (collected from whole blood samples). Together, these analyses will allow us to better understand microbiome-host interactions and their role in eliciting a protective vaccine-derived effector-memory T cell response. Such understanding will inform future vaccination strategies and attempts to modulate microbiome composition to affect vaccine efficacy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The types and numbers of bacterial species that live in the gastrointestinal tract (together known as the microbiome) affect many aspects of human health and disease, including how individuals respond to vaccination and viral infection. In this study, we will define the gastrointestinal microbiome of rhesus monkeys before and after vaccination with an experimental AIDS vaccine and after infection with a monkey immunodeficiency virus. This study will allow us to determine how the microbiome impacts the effectiveness of the vaccine and may suggest whether altering the microbiome may improve vaccine performance.            ",Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge,8992226,R21AI120713,"['AIDS Vaccines', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Blood specimen', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monkeys', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Network-based', 'Oregon', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'SIV', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Swab', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Viremia', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Washington', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'functional genomics', 'gastrointestinal', 'improved', 'microbiome', 'nonhuman primate', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'rectal', 'response', 'vaccination strategy', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'vector']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2015,217500,0.005016786891308619
"New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Maha R Farhat, MD is an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School on the tenure track and a staff physician in the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital.

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.                ",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9044227,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Computational Science', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'killings', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2015,230806,0.03357389230252023
"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)?         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.            ","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",8703195,U01GM110721,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronavirus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Influenza A Virus', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Middle East', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Movement', 'Natural History', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'age group', 'base', 'contextual factors', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiological model', 'forest', 'genetic evolution', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel virus', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'resistant strain', 'seasonal influenza', 'simulation', 'social', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,U OF L IMPERIAL COL OF SCI/TECHNLGY/MED,U01,2014,427668,0.09022308773367738
"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health.

"A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am trained as a computational biologist and statistician, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. My main career goal is to become an independent researcher at a major research institution. I plan to continue my current research pursuits in global health and infectious diseases. Specifically, I aim to continue developing mathematical and computational approaches for modeling to understand disease transmission, forecasting future dynamics and evaluating interventions for public policy decisions. As a postdoctoral research fellow, I have had the wonderful opportunity of working with data from multiple sources. Although several of these data streams could be labeled as ""Big Data"", I typically work with the data after it is already processed, filtered and aggregated to a daily or weekly resolution. While I have developed the necessary skills for modeling these already processed data, there are three important areas where I require additional training, mentoring, and experience: (1) advanced computational skills especially in the use of high performance computing and informatics tools, (2) techniques in computational machine learning and data mining necessary for data acquisition and processing, and (3) biostatistical methodology needed for the statistical design of studies involving big data. These three training and mentoring aims would enable me to develop the skills necessary to become an independent investigator in Big Data Science for biomedical research. Boston Children's School and Harvard Medical School are leading institutions in translational biomedical research, thereby making them the ideal environment to pursue the training and research aims in this proposal. The recent emergence of infectious diseases such as the avian influenza H7N9 in China, and re-emergence of diseases such as polio in Syria underscores the importance of strengthening immunization and emergency response programs for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Researchers have developed computational and mathematical models to capture determinants of infectious disease dynamics and identify factors that support prediction of these dynamics, provide estimates of disease risk, and evaluate various intervention scenarios. While these studies have been extremely useful for the understanding of infectious disease transmission and control, most have been disease specific and solely used data from traditional disease surveillance systems. In contrast, there is a huge amount of internet-based data that have been extensively assessed and validated for public health surveillance in the last decade, but it has been scarcely used in conjunction with other data sources for modeling to predict disease spread. Using these novel digital event-based data sources in combination with climate and case data from traditional disease surveillance systems, we will establish a much needed framework for integrating these disparate data sources for modeling to estimate disease risk and forecasting temporal dynamics of infectious diseases. Our approach will be achieved through three aims. The first objective is to develop an automated process for acquiring, processing and filtering data for modeling (Aim 1). Once we gather this data, we will develop temporal models for the dynamical assessment of the relationship between the various data variables and infectious disease incidence (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess the utility of the modeling approaches developed under Aim 2 for forecasting temporal trends of infectious diseases (Aim 3). Through data acquisition, thorough processing, statistical and epidemiological modeling, and guided by advisers with expertise in biomedical informatics, computer science and statistics, we plan to achieve a comprehensive approach to integrating multiple data streams for modeling to forecast infectious diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there have been significant medical and technological advances towards infectious disease prevention, surveillance and control, infectious diseases still account for an estimated 15 million deaths each year worldwide. Reliable forecasts of infectious disease dynamics can influence decisions regarding prioritization of limited resources during outbreaks, optimization of disease interventions and implementation of rigorous surveillance processes for quicker case identification and control of emerging disease outbreaks. Our goal is therefore to develop a data mining/informatics framework that leverages the huge amount of digital event-based data sources in combination with climate data, and data from traditional disease surveillance systems for modeling and forecasting infectious diseases.            ",A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases,8829434,K01ES025438,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza', 'Big Data', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Boston', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'China', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Immunization', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Middle East', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Population Surveillance', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention program', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Report (account)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Syndrome', 'Syria', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiological model', 'experience', 'global health', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'mathematical model', 'medical schools', 'news', 'novel', 'pandemic influenza', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trend', 'web based interface']",NIEHS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2014,42469,0.11414059402875582

"MACHINE LEARNING TO FORECAST ZOONOTIC DISEASE EMERGENCE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As over 70% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by parasites or pathogens transmitted from animals to humans (leading to 'zoonotic' infections), a fundamental issues for public health is identifying the drivers leading to zoonotic diseases in humans. Cross-species transmission of infectious agents depends on numerous traits of hosts, their infectious agents, and environmental factors defining the external context of disease. Previous studies identifying predictors of cross-species transmission have been limited by a focus on single infectious diseases (e.g., rabies, Lyme disease) at restricted spatial scales, in part because large-scale analyses spanning numerous host species and infectious agents are precluded by the many complex interactions, autocorrelations, and sampling biases common in multivariate, high-dimensional data. The proposed research confronts these computational limitations through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, analyses will address three outstanding and interrelated questions in global health: (1) What characteristics signal a predisposition of mammalian host species to be reservoirs of zoonotic disease?; (2) What traits among infectious agents predict their potential to cause zoonotic infection?; (3) What are the most important environmental and anthropogenic predictors of zoonotic outbreaks globally? Analyses will apply a series of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to new, global-scale databases containing biological, ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic data for three groups of mammalian hosts (primates, carnivores, and ungulates) and their zoonotic infectious agents. A long-term goal of this research is to empirically develop ""rules of thumb"" about zoonotic diseases by highlighting the key traits of mammalian hosts, infectious agents, and the environmental and human factors describing zoonotic outbreaks in recent history. Ultimately, research proposed herein will provide a basis for predicting the geographic locations, infectious agents, and animal reservoirs from which future zoonoses will emerge.        This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment. Ultimately, this project aims to predict the locations and species from which future diseases will emerge, and is therefore directly relevant for the improvement of human health.

"Text Processing and Geospatial Uncertainty for Phylogeography of Zoonotic Viruses     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Phylogeography of zoonotic viruses studies the geographical spread and genetic lineages of viruses that are transmittable between animals and humans such as avian influenza and rabies. This science can help state public health and agriculture agencies identify the animal hosts that most impact virus propagation in a particular geographic region, the migration path of the virus including its origin, and the patterns of infection in various host populations, including humans, over time. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), specifically GenBank, provides an abundance of available viral sequence data for phylogeography. Sequences and their metadata can be downloaded and imported into software applications that generate phylogeographic trees and models for surveillance. However, geospatial metadata such as host location is inconsistently represented and sparse across GenBank entries, with our preliminary studies showing only about 20% of the GenBank records contain specific information such as a county, town, or region within a state. While this detailed geospatial information might be included in the corresponding journal article, it is not available for immediate use in a bioinformatics or GIS application unless it is manually extracted and linked back to the appropriate sequence. Absence of precise sampling locations from easily-computable secondary data sources such as GenBank increases the difficulty of achieving accurate phylogeographic models of virus migration. We propose an infrastructure to improve phylogeographic models of virus migration by linking relevant geospatial data from the literature. This work represents the first effort to use automatically extracted geospatial data present in journal articles corresponding to GenBank records in order to enhance modeling of virus migration. Our research will extend phylogeography and zoonotic surveillance by: creating a Natural Language Processing (NLP) infrastructure that will improve the level of detail of geospatial data for phylogeography of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1), develop phylogeographic models using the data extracted in Aim 1 with adequate biostatistical models (Aim 2), and evaluating the impact of our approach for phylogeography and surveillance of zoonotic viruses (Aim 3). Thus, this work will provide researchers with a framework for population surveillance using an integrated biomedical informatics approach including NLP, biostatistics, bioinformatics, and database design.           We will create Natural Language Processing Infrastructure and novel phylogeographic models of zoonotic viruses that will allow state public health and agriculture agencies and other researchers to study virus migration. This will enhance population health surveillance including identification of the animal hosts that most impact virus propagation in a particular geographic region, the migration path of zoonotic pathogens, and the patterns of infection in various host populations over time, including humans. This resource will enable state agencies to implement improved public health control measures that will reduce morbidity and mortality of animals and humans from zoonotic diseases.

"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health.

"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research  Project Summary (Abstract):  Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.  Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.          n/a",Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission,8279285,K01AI079162,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brazil', 'Capital', 'Chagas Disease', 'Child', 'Chile', 'Cities', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecology', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Insect Vectors', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Retinal Cone', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Solutions', 'South America', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Triatoma', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'computer science', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'high risk', 'international center', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'rural area', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'urban area', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2012,105194,0.036501318796852165
"HealthMap: Knowledge Management for Emerging Infectious Disease Intelligence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Even as many developed countries strengthen their traditional clinically-based surveillance capacity, a basic level of health information infrastructure is still lacking in many parts of the developing world, including areas that are most vulnerable to emerging health threats. To help fill this gap, electronic news outlets, disease reporting networks, discussion sites, and blogs are proving to be invaluable data sources for a new generation of public health surveillance systems that operate across international borders- almost all major outbreaks investigated by WHO, including SARS, are first identified by these informal online sources. These data sources provide local and timely information about disease outbreaks and related events around the world, including areas relatively invisible to day-to-day global public health efforts due to lack of infrastructure or political suppression of information. However, since this information is dispersed and largely unstructured, there is lack of organization and integration between sources, precluding a global view of all ongoing disease threats. In order to construct such an integrated view of current emerging infections, we deployed an early prototype called Health Map, a freely available multi-stream real-time knowledge management system that aggregates and maps health alerts across numerous key data sources, including WHO alerts, newswires, mailing lists. Leveraging our previous National Library of Medicine funded work in real-time health monitoring; we propose extensive development of this new digital resource to address technological and methodological barriers to achieving a synthesized, comprehensive, and customized view of global health. The principal objective of Health Map development is to provide access to the greatest amount of possibly useful information across the widest variety of geographical areas and disease agents, without overwhelming the user with an excess of information, or obscuring important and urgent elements. We will specifically address the challenge of providing structure to unstructured data while still enabling the astute user to notice the subtle pattern that could be an early indication of a significant outbreak. Development of Health Map will proceed along the four key components of surveillance: (1) data acquisition (evaluation and integration of multiple electronic sources) (2) information characterization (disease and location categorization and severity rating of unstructured data), (3) signal interpretation (multi-stream signal detection, spatiotemporal modeling and risk assessment) and (4) knowledge dissemination (tiered dissemination of global infectious disease alerts and flexible data visualization tools). In each area, we will make critical enhancements to the existing prototype. We plan rigorous evaluation to ensure that Health Map successfully leverages electronic sources for surveillance, communication, and intervention. We will also conduct comprehensive user testing, usability studies, user behavior analysis as part of our effort. Our goal is to make Health Map a vital knowledge resource tailored for both the general public and public health decision-makers.        Although an enormous amount of information about current infectious disease outbreaks is found in Web- accessible information sources, this information is dispersed and not well-organized, making it almost impossible for public health officials and concerned citizens to know about all ongoing emerging disease threats. Through rigorous development of our online HealthMap system, we plan to provide a synthesized, timely and comprehensive view of current global infectious disease outbreaks by acquiring, integrating and disseminating a wide variety of Internet-based information sources.

"MACHINE LEARNING TO FORECAST ZOONOTIC DISEASE EMERGENCE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As over 70% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by parasites or pathogens transmitted from animals to humans (leading to 'zoonotic' infections), a fundamental issues for public health is identifying the drivers leading to zoonotic diseases in humans. Cross-species transmission of infectious agents depends on numerous traits of hosts, their infectious agents, and environmental factors defining the external context of disease. Previous studies identifying predictors of cross-species transmission have been limited by a focus on single infectious diseases (e.g., rabies, Lyme disease) at restricted spatial scales, in part because large-scale analyses spanning numerous host species and infectious agents are precluded by the many complex interactions, autocorrelations, and sampling biases common in multivariate, high-dimensional data. The proposed research confronts these computational limitations through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, analyses will address three outstanding and interrelated questions in global health: (1) What characteristics signal a predisposition of mammalian host species to be reservoirs of zoonotic disease?; (2) What traits among infectious agents predict their potential to cause zoonotic infection?; (3) What are the most important environmental and anthropogenic predictors of zoonotic outbreaks globally? Analyses will apply a series of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to new, global-scale databases containing biological, ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic data for three groups of mammalian hosts (primates, carnivores, and ungulates) and their zoonotic infectious agents. A long-term goal of this research is to empirically develop ""rules of thumb"" about zoonotic diseases by highlighting the key traits of mammalian hosts, infectious agents, and the environmental and human factors describing zoonotic outbreaks in recent history. Ultimately, research proposed herein will provide a basis for predicting the geographic locations, infectious agents, and animal reservoirs from which future zoonoses will emerge.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment. Ultimately, this project aims to predict the locations and species from which future diseases will emerge, and is therefore directly relevant for the improvement of human health.           This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment.

"Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): The large and growing size of the healthcare system makes it imperative to understand what is happening to us, the recipients of healthcare, to be able to efficiently conduct research to improve healthcare delivery and to improve the state of biomedicine by advancing its science. i2b2, ""Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside"" seeks to provide this instrumentation using the informational by products of healthcare and the biological materials accumulated through the delivery of healthcare. This complements existing efforts to create prospective cohort studies or trials outside the delivery of routine healthcare. In the first round of i2b2, we demonstrated that we could identify known adverse events and phenotypically select and then genotype patients for genetic association at approximately 1/10* of the price and less than l/10 of the time usually entailed to develop such populations for study. The challenge we have set ourselves for the next methodological challenge in i2b2 is the development of Virtual Cohort Studies (VCS) encompassing the population of a healthcare system as study subjects and asking questions of comparative effectiveness, unforeseen adverse events and identification of clinically relevant subpopulations including both clinical and genome-scale measures. We will be comparing the results of the VCS to those of carefully planned and executed cohort studies such as the Framingham Heart Study. VCS will require multiple methodological advances and tools development including in the disciplines of natural language processing, temporal reasoning, predictive modeling, biostatistics and machine learning. VCS methods will be tested by two driving biology projects, the first studying a collection of autoimmune diseases and the second type 2 diabetes. In both projects, VCS methods will be applied to investigate the components of cardiovascular risk from the genetic to the epigenetic and including the full range of clinical history including medications exposure. A systems/integrative approach will be taken to identify commonalities in these risk profiles across these disparate disease domains. VCS methods will be shared with i2b2 user community under open source governance while i2b2 user community contributions are folded into the i2b2 toolkit. Public Health Relevance: The i2b2 model of using existing clinical data for high throughput, cost effective, and timely research promises to rapidly leverage our nation's ability to better understand the existing disease burden and how best to achieve cost-effective clinical effectiveness, including new drug targets, new uses of existing drugs and improved management of existing disease.",Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2),8144250,U54LM008748,[' '],NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U54,2011,2657626,0.014336858459335177
"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms.

Development of Health Map will proceed along the four key components of surveillance: (1) data acquisition (evaluation and integration of multiple electronic sources) (2) information characterization (disease and location categorization and severity rating of unstructured data), (3) signal interpretation (multi-stream signal detection, spatiotemporal modeling and risk assessment) and (4) knowledge dissemination (tiered dissemination of global infectious disease alerts and flexible data visualization tools). In each area, we will make critical enhancements to the existing prototype. We plan rigorous evaluation to ensure that Health Map successfully leverages electronic sources for surveillance, communication, and intervention.

"Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The identification of the molecular and cellular basis for adverse events observed in patients immunized against smallpox is of great public health interest. This is especially true today given efforts to defend the U.S. population and military against potential bioterrorism agents. We have shown recently that adverse vents following smallpox vaccination correlate with systemic cytokine patterns, suggesting a role for cytokines in the pathogenesis of adverse events. A challenge to further delineating the immunological mechanisms of adverse events is that cytokines rarely act in isolation to induce an immune response, but rather they work in a complex network to which immune system cells respond. Cytokines are small signaling proteins that integrate the activities of immune system cells. While it is often well understood how they act individually, the behavior of cytokines as part of a signaling network is less well known and likely depends on the nature of the infecting organism. We propose to develop and evaluate a comprehensive strategy to identify detailed kinetic cytokine network models associated with adverse events following smallpox vaccination. This strategy will be developed and evaluated using proteomic time-series data available from 103 volunteers that are part of an ongoing NIAID/NIH-sponsored trial to evaluate the Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine (APSV). We will develop software tools using machine learning algorithms to automatically discover cytokine signaling network models from observed time-series cytokine expression levels. Once the underlying cytokine network model has been estimated, our goal is to use the dynamic model as a simulation tool to suggest ways to create vaccines that minimize the risk of adverse events associated with vaccination. The software tools developed in this proposal will be generally applicable for biomedical research to understand the biochemical interactions in time-series data, and, thus, a useful and novel software package will be made available to the vaccine research community. The experience and knowledge gained during the collaboration on this important research problem in immunology coupled with the didactic and mentoring portions of the training program will create a firm foundation upon which I can develop and test significant hypotheses for future studies on the immunology of infectious diseases.             n/a",Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine,7791405,K25AI064625,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bioterrorism', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Engineering', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Simulate', 'Smallpox', 'Smallpox Vaccine', 'Software Tools', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'interest', 'network models', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'software development', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TULSA,K25,2010,113132,0.06961240037056632
"Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): The large and growing size of the healthcare system makes it imperative to understand what is happening to us, the recipients of healthcare, to be able to efficiently conduct research to improve healthcare delivery and to improve the state of biomedicine by advancing its science. i2b2, ""Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside"" seeks to provide this instrumentation using the informational by products of healthcare and the biological materials accumulated through the delivery of healthcare. This complements existing efforts to create prospective cohort studies or trials outside the delivery of routine healthcare. In the first round of i2b2, we demonstrated that we could identify known adverse events and phenotypically select and then genotype patients for genetic association at approximately 1/10* of the price and less than l/10 of the time usually entailed to develop such populations for study. The challenge we have set ourselves for the next methodological challenge in i2b2 is the development of Virtual Cohort Studies (VCS) encompassing the population of a healthcare system as study subjects and asking questions of comparative effectiveness, unforeseen adverse events and identification of clinically relevant subpopulations including both clinical and genome-scale measures. We will be comparing the results of the VCS to those of carefully planned and executed cohort studies such as the Framingham Heart Study. VCS will require multiple methodological advances and tools development including in the disciplines of natural language processing, temporal reasoning, predictive modeling, biostatistics and machine learning. VCS methods will be tested by two driving biology projects, the first studying a collection of autoimmune diseases and the second type 2 diabetes. In both projects, VCS methods will be applied to investigate the components of cardiovascular risk from the genetic to the epigenetic and including the full range of clinical history including medications exposure. A systems/integrative approach will be taken to identify commonalities in these risk profiles across these disparate disease domains. VCS methods will be shared with i2b2 user community under open source governance while i2b2 user community contributions are folded into the i2b2 toolkit. Public Health Relevance: The i2b2 model of using existing clinical data for high throughput, cost effective, and timely research promises to rapidly leverage our nation's ability to better understand the existing disease burden and how best to achieve cost-effective clinical effectiveness, including new drug targets, new uses of existing drugs and improved management of existing disease.",Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2),8012931,U54LM008748,[' '],NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U54,2010,3966606,0.014336858459335177
"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere.

"HealthMap: Knowledge Management for Emerging Infectious Disease Intelligence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Even as many developed countries strengthen their traditional clinically-based surveillance capacity, a basic level of health information infrastructure is still lacking in many parts of the developing world, including areas that are most vulnerable to emerging health threats. To help fill this gap, electronic news outlets, disease reporting networks, discussion sites, and blogs are proving to be invaluable data sources for a new generation of public health surveillance systems that operate across international borders- almost all major outbreaks investigated by WHO, including SARS, are first identified by these informal online sources. These data sources provide local and timely information about disease outbreaks and related events around the world, including areas relatively invisible to day-to-day global public health efforts due to lack of infrastructure or political suppression of information. However, since this information is dispersed and largely unstructured, there is lack of organization and integration between sources, precluding a global view of all ongoing disease threats. In order to construct such an integrated view of current emerging infections, we deployed an early prototype called Health Map, a freely available multi-stream real-time knowledge management system that aggregates and maps health alerts across numerous key data sources, including WHO alerts, newswires, mailing lists. Leveraging our previous National Library of Medicine funded work in real-time health monitoring; we propose extensive development of this new digital resource to address technological and methodological barriers to achieving a synthesized, comprehensive, and customized view of global health. The principal objective of Health Map development is to provide access to the greatest amount of possibly useful information across the widest variety of geographical areas and disease agents, without overwhelming the user with an excess of information, or obscuring important and urgent elements. We will specifically address the challenge of providing structure to unstructured data while still enabling the astute user to notice the subtle pattern that could be an early indication of a significant outbreak.

An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning. The goal of this project is to develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology and apply it to vaccine literature mining and analysis of vaccine-induced immune mechanisms.",Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research,7735790,R01AI081062,"['Algorithms', 'Attenuated Live Virus Vaccine', 'Automated Annotation', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Brucella', 'Brucella Vaccine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Ensure', 'Escherichia coli', 'Escherichia coli Vaccines', 'Foundations', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Informatics', 'Information Networks', 'Information Retrieval', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Smallpox Vaccine', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Subunit Vaccines', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'data integration', 'editorial', 'gene function', 'genome-wide', 'interest', 'journal article', 'microorganism', 'novel', 'novel vaccines', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'repository', 'research study', 'statistics', 'text searching', 'user-friendly', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine evaluation', 'web interface']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2009,270375,0.01689884334492178
"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city.

"HealthMap: Knowledge Management for Emerging Infectious Disease Intelligence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Even as many developed countries strengthen their traditional clinically-based surveillance capacity, a basic level of health information infrastructure is still lacking in many parts of the developing world, including areas that are most vulnerable to emerging health threats. To help fill this gap, electronic news outlets, disease reporting networks, discussion sites, and blogs are proving to be invaluable data sources for a new generation of public health surveillance systems that operate across international borders- almost all major outbreaks investigated by WHO, including SARS, are first identified by these informal online sources. These data sources provide local and timely information about disease outbreaks and related events around the world, including areas relatively invisible to day-to-day global public health efforts due to lack of infrastructure or political suppression of information. However, since this information is dispersed and largely unstructured, there is lack of organization and integration between sources, precluding a global view of all ongoing disease threats. In order to construct such an integrated view of current emerging infections, we deployed an early prototype called Health Map, a freely available multi-stream real-time knowledge management system that aggregates and maps health alerts across numerous key data sources, including WHO alerts, newswires, mailing lists. Leveraging our previous National Library of Medicine funded work in real-time health monitoring; we propose extensive development of this new digital resource to address technological and methodological barriers to achieving a synthesized, comprehensive, and customized view of global health. The principal objective of Health Map development is to provide access to the greatest amount of possibly useful information across the widest variety of geographical areas and disease agents, without overwhelming the user with an excess of information, or obscuring important and urgent elements. We will specifically address the challenge of providing structure to unstructured data while still enabling the astute user to notice the subtle pattern that could be an early indication of a significant outbreak. Development of Health Map will proceed along the four key components of surveillance: (1) data acquisition (evaluation and integration of multiple electronic sources) (2) information characterization (disease and location categorization and severity rating of unstructured data), (3) signal interpretation (multi-stream signal detection, spatiotemporal modeling and risk assessment) and (4) knowledge dissemination (tiered dissemination of global infectious disease alerts and flexible data visualization tools). In each area, we will make critical enhancements to the existing prototype. We plan rigorous evaluation to ensure that Health Map successfully leverages electronic sources for surveillance, communication, and intervention. We will also conduct comprehensive user testing, usability studies, user behavior analysis as part of our effort. Our goal is to make Health Map a vital knowledge resource tailored for both the general public and public health decision-makers.        Although an enormous amount of information about current infectious disease outbreaks is found in Web- accessible information sources, this information is dispersed and not well-organized, making it almost impossible for public health officials and concerned citizens to know about all ongoing emerging disease threats.

"Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The identification of the molecular and cellular basis for adverse events observed in patients immunized against smallpox is of great public health interest. This is especially true today given efforts to defend the U.S. population and military against potential bioterrorism agents. We have shown recently that adverse vents following smallpox vaccination correlate with systemic cytokine patterns, suggesting a role for cytokines in the pathogenesis of adverse events. A challenge to further delineating the immunological mechanisms of adverse events is that cytokines rarely act in isolation to induce an immune response, but rather they work in a complex network to which immune system cells respond. Cytokines are small signaling proteins that integrate the activities of immune system cells. While it is often well understood how they act individually, the behavior of cytokines as part of a signaling network is less well known and likely depends on the nature of the infecting organism. We propose to develop and evaluate a comprehensive strategy to identify detailed kinetic cytokine network models associated with adverse events following smallpox vaccination. This strategy will be developed and evaluated using proteomic time-series data available from 103 volunteers that are part of an ongoing NIAID/NIH-sponsored trial to evaluate the Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine (APSV). We will develop software tools using machine learning algorithms to automatically discover cytokine signaling network models from observed time-series cytokine expression levels. Once the underlying cytokine network model has been estimated, our goal is to use the dynamic model as a simulation tool to suggest ways to create vaccines that minimize the risk of adverse events associated with vaccination. The software tools developed in this proposal will be generally applicable for biomedical research to understand the biochemical interactions in time-series data, and, thus, a useful and novel software package will be made available to the vaccine research community. The experience and knowledge gained during the collaboration on this important research problem in immunology coupled with the didactic and mentoring portions of the training program will create a firm foundation upon which I can develop and test significant hypotheses for future studies on the immunology of infectious diseases.             n/a",Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine,7491749,K25AI064625,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bioterrorism', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Engineering', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Simulate', 'Smallpox', 'Smallpox Vaccine', 'Software Tools', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Training Programs', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'interest', 'network models', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'software development', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K25,2008,106794,0.06961240037056632

"Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Microbial threats, including bioterrorism and naturally emerging infectious diseases, pose a serious challenge to national security in the United States and to health worldwide.  This proposal describes the creation of a center for computational modeling of infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, with the collaboration of key experts at the Brookings Institution, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, the University of Maryland, and Imperial College (London).  The overarching aim of this project is to integrate the most advanced and powerful techniques of epidemiological data analysis with those of computer simulation (agent-based modeling) to produce a unified computational epidemiology that is scientifically sound, highly visual and user-friendly, and responsive to biosecurity and public health policy requirements.  Data analysis will be guided by the insight that epidemic patterns over space and time can be approached as nearly decomposable systems, in which frequency components of the incidence signal can be isolated and studied.  Wavelet transforms, and empiric mode decomposition using Hilbert-Huang Transforms, will be used to sift nonlinear, nonstationary epidemiological data, allowing frequency band patterns to be defined.  Isolated frequency modes will then be associated with external forcing (weather, social contact patterns) and internal dynamics (Kermack-McKendrick predator-prey models).  Results of the epidemiological data decomposition analysis, along with the knowledge of infectious disease experts, will instruct the creation and development of agent-based models.  Such models feature populations of mobile individuals in artificial societies that interact locally with other individuals.  Features of the basic model include variable social network structures, individual susceptibility and immunity, incubation periods, transmission rates, contact rates, and other selectable parameters.  After the agent-based model is calibrated to generate epidemic patterns consistent with real world epidemiology, preventive strategies including vaccination, contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, and other public health measures will be systematically introduced and their impact evaluated.  Methods will be developed for assessing the utility of individual models, and for making decisions based on combined results from more than one model.

"Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Microbial threats, including bioterrorism and naturally emerging infectious diseases, pose a serious challenge to national security in the United States and to health worldwide.  This proposal describes the creation of a center for computational modeling of infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, with the collaboration of key experts at the Brookings Institution, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, the University of Maryland, and Imperial College (London).  The overarching aim of this project is to integrate the most advanced and powerful techniques of epidemiological data analysis with those of computer simulation (agent-based modeling) to produce a unified computational epidemiology that is scientifically sound, highly visual and user-friendly, and responsive to biosecurity and public health policy requirements.  Data analysis will be guided by the insight that epidemic patterns over space and time can be approached as nearly decomposable systems, in which frequency components of the incidence signal can be isolated and studied.  Wavelet transforms, and empiric mode decomposition using Hilbert-Huang Transforms, will be used to sift nonlinear, nonstationary epidemiological data, allowing frequency band patterns to be defined.  Isolated frequency modes will then be associated with external forcing (weather, social contact patterns) and internal dynamics (Kermack-McKendrick predator-prey models).  Results of the epidemiological data decomposition analysis, along with the knowledge of infectious disease experts, will instruct the creation and development of agent-based models.  Such models feature populations of mobile individuals in artificial societies that interact locally with other individuals.  Features of the basic model include variable social network structures, individual susceptibility and immunity, incubation periods, transmission rates, contact rates, and other selectable parameters.  After the agent-based model is calibrated to generate epidemic patterns consistent with real world epidemiology, preventive strategies including vaccination, contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, and other public health measures will be systematically introduced and their impact evaluated.  Methods will be developed for assessing the utility of individual models, and for making decisions based on combined results from more than one model.  Infectious diseases to be studied initially include smallpox, SARS, dengue, West Nile, and unknown but hypothetically plausible agents.

"Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The identification of the molecular and cellular basis for adverse events observed in patients immunized against smallpox is of great public health interest. This is especially true today given efforts to defend the U.S. population and military against potential bioterrorism agents. We have shown recently that adverse vents following smallpox vaccination correlate with systemic cytokine patterns, suggesting a role for cytokines in the pathogenesis of adverse events. A challenge to further delineating the immunological mechanisms of adverse events is that cytokines rarely act in isolation to induce an immune response, but rather they work in a complex network to which immune system cells respond. Cytokines are small signaling proteins that integrate the activities of immune system cells. While it is often well understood how they act individually, the behavior of cytokines as part of a signaling network is less well known and likely depends on the nature of the infecting organism. We propose to develop and evaluate a comprehensive strategy to identify detailed kinetic cytokine network models associated with adverse events following smallpox vaccination. This strategy will be developed and evaluated using proteomic time-series data available from 103 volunteers that are part of an ongoing NIAID/NIH-sponsored trial to evaluate the Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine (APSV). We will develop software tools using machine learning algorithms to automatically discover cytokine signaling network models from observed time-series cytokine expression levels. Once the underlying cytokine network model has been estimated, our goal is to use the dynamic model as a simulation tool to suggest ways to create vaccines that minimize the risk of adverse events associated with vaccination. The software tools developed in this proposal will be generally applicable for biomedical research to understand the biochemical interactions in time-series data, and, thus, a useful and novel software package will be made available to the vaccine research community. The experience and knowledge gained during the collaboration on this important research problem in immunology coupled with the didactic and mentoring portions of the training program will create a firm foundation upon which I can develop and test significant hypotheses for future studies on the immunology of infectious diseases.             n/a",Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine,7208003,K25AI064625,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bioterrorism', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Engineering', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Simulate', 'Smallpox', 'Smallpox Vaccine', 'Software Tools', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Training Programs', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'interest', 'network models', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'software development', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K25,2007,103762,0.06961240037056632

"THE STANFORD PHARMACOGENETICS KNOWLEDGE BASE We propose to create the Stanford PharmacoGenetic Knowledge Base (PharmGKB), an integrated data resource to support the NIGMS Pharmacogenetic Research Network and Database Initiative.  This initiative will focus on how genetic variation contributes to variation in the response to drugs, and will produce data from a wide range of sources.  The PharmGKB will therefore interlink genomic, molecular, cellular and clinical information about gene systems important for modulating drug responses.  The PharmGKB is based on a powerful hierarchical data representation system that allows the data model to change as new knowledge is learned, while ensuring the security and stability of the data with a relational database foundation.  Our proposal defines an interactive process for defining a data model, creating automated systems for data submission, integrating the PharmGKB with other biological and clinical data resources, and creating a robust interface to the data and to the associated analytic tools. Finally, we outline a research plan that uses the PharmGKB to (1) address difficult data modeling challenges that arise in the course of building the resource, (2) study the user interface requirements of a database with such a wide range of information sources, and (3) model and analyze the structural variations of proteins to shed light on the molecular consequences of genetic variation.

"Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with over 30,000 new HPV-related-cancers are diagnosed annually. Although HPV vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2006 and recommended for routine vaccination for school-age girls and boys, vaccination rates remain low. One reason that has contributed to low vaccination rates is incorrect “risk perceptions” around HPV vaccines such as the high perceived risks of adverse events or side effects from the HPV vaccine. Incorrect risk perceptions are often rooted in the false information about HPV vaccines that people are exposed to in their daily life, including social media. The impact of social media on health information is substantial. Negative social-media HPV-vaccine information has been found to have an association with low vaccination coverage. Given the negative consequences of false information, there is a need to develop a robust and scalable way to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it propagates and negatively impacts behavior. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to build a model to identify false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter, demonstrate its impact on individual risk perceptions and measure its underlying mechanisms on risk perception formation. We propose a novel approach to leverage machine learning, natural language processing, network analysis, crowdsourcing/expert data annotation, psycholinguistic analysis and statistical modeling to investigate the false HPV-vaccine information collectively (in terms of its detection and propagation patterns) and individually (in terms of its impact and underlying cognitive mechanisms). Our study will first build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter. By modeling the domain-specific HPV- vaccine related text content, information-veracity related linguistic features, individual and collective user behaviors, and dissemination patterns, our model will be able to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it gets verified and spreads widely. We will then investigate the impact of false HPV-vaccine information on risk perceptions around HPV vaccination operationalized by natural language processing methods and a developed HPV-vaccine Risk Lexicon. We will further conduct psycholinguistic analysis on the false HPV-vaccine information and use statistical modeling to uncover the underlying mechanism of risk perceptions. Our study will make a critical and timely contribution to identifying the false HPV-vaccine information and its impact, which has the potential to be applied to other health topics. This proposed project will also address the National Cancer Institute priorities in promoting HPV vaccines and combating misinformation in cancer prevention and control. PROJECT NARRATIVE The uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in part because of incorrect perceptions of vaccination risks, which has been linked to the spread of false HPV-vaccine information. The proposed study seeks to build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on social media (Twitter) and determine its impact on risk perceptions of the HPV vaccine. The findings will provide important contributions to understand the impact of false health information on HPV vaccination behavior and could be expanded to other health topics.",Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions,9954963,R21CA237483,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine', 'Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Individual', 'Information Dissemination', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plant Roots', 'Politics', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'School-Age Population', 'Semantics', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Text', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'adverse event risk', 'boys', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer prevention', 'combat', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'girls', 'high risk', 'information model', 'information processing', 'multilevel analysis', 'news', 'novel strategies', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'risk perception', 'side effect', 'social media', 'theories', 'uptake']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,211659,-0.006032033206601208
"The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence Project Summary Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are the most common types of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in the world. VBD epidemics have been increasing over recent decades, with tickborne diseases having doubled in the last decade in the United States. Despite the increase in public health burden, over 80% of vector-control organizations lack preventative capabilities. Understanding the interplay between the environment, vectors, pathogens, and humans that expedite disease spread remains a challenge. The overarching goal of this project is to identify the key environmental and human drivers that have led to the emergence of VBDs. Current models that predict tickborne disease risk have oversimplified the process by focusing only on the vector, i.e. risk of tick exposure. A human’s risk of infection is not only a function of entomological risk but also of factors inherent to the individual including behavior or characteristics that increase susceptibility to disease. This project proposes a novel approach to tickborne disease prediction by developing a comprehensive model that incorporate pathogen population dynamics and human factors to predict disease risk. This study will investigate several pathogens vectored by the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis): Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic anaplasmosis), and Babesia microti (babesiosis). The central hypothesis is that the prediction of tickborne disease risk can be improved by using sophisticated statistical methods to identify environmental drivers that impact pathogen population dynamics while incorporating human demographic characteristics. The hypothesis will be addressed in the following aims: (1) Determine the current and historical population dynamic patterns of pathogens vectored by I. scapularis to predict pathogen distribution; (2) Determine the association between human characteristics and tick-borne disease risk in order to develop an improved spatial disease risk model. This model will allow the identification and quantification of factors that are associated with the emergence of tickborne diseases in New York State, which is geographically advantageous because it is representative of much of the natural environment that ticks encounter in the northeastern US including rapid and recent changes in climate and landscapes. The results of this project will be used to develop a public disease warning system that will use contemporary and future climate forecasts to monitor tick populations and predict potential disease outbreaks for areas with vulnerable populations. With climate forecasts predicting an increase in 2-3°C in temperature by 2100, there is uncertainty in how diseases will shift and a warning system will allow preparation accordingly. At the completion of the proposed research project, the applicant will have acquired the following skillsets through intensive, interdisciplinary mentorship: big data analysis, advanced statistics including Bayesian and machine learning methods, spatial analyses, and risk analysis. This will enable the applicant to succeed as an independent investigator to address the challenges posed by emerging infectious diseases. Project Narrative Vector-borne diseases are the most common types of emerging infectious diseases in the world and constitute major threats to public health. My project uses advanced statistical methods to uncover how interactions between environmental factors affecting pathogen population dynamics and human demographic characteristics determine human risk for three tick-borne diseases: Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. The results of my project will be used to create a risk map to predict the spatial and temporal occurrence of tickborne diseases, which can inform public health strategies in order to mitigate disease burden.",The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence,10018461,F31AI133871,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Anaplasma phagocytophilum', 'Anaplasmosis', 'Area', 'Award', 'Babesia microti', 'Babesiosis', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Black-legged Tick', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Characteristics', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Contracts', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Trees', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecological Change', 'Ecology', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Entomology', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'New York', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Tick-Borne Diseases', 'Tick-Borne Infections', 'Ticks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'anthropogenesis', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cost effective', 'decision tree learning', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'environmental change', 'geographic population', 'granulocyte', 'human disease', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'machine learning method', 'model design', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pathogen exposure', 'predictive modeling', 'regression trees', 'spatial temporal variation', 'statistics', 'tick bite', 'tick-borne pathogen', 'trend', 'vector', 'vector control', 'vector transmission']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,38185,0.04061992490202222
"Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data Project Abstract/Summary Our interdisciplinary research team will develop algorithms to accelerate the detection of respiratory virus outbreaks at an unprecedented local scale in US cities. We propose to advance outbreak detection by combining machine learning data integration methods and spatial models of disease transmission. The dynamic models that will be developed will provide mechanistic engines for distinguishing typical from atypical disease trends and the optimization methods evaluate the informativeness of data sources to achieve specified public health goals through the rapid evaluation of diverse input data sources. Working with local healthcare and public health leaders, we will translate the algorithms into user-friendly online tools to support preparedness plans and decision-making. Our proposed research is organized around three major aims. In Aim 1, we will apply machine learning and signal processing methods to build systems that track the earliest indicators of emerging outbreaks within seven US cities. We will evaluate non-clinical data reflecting early and mild symptoms as well as clinical data covering underserved communities and geographic and demographic hotspots for viral emergence. In Aim 2, we will develop sub-city scale models reflecting the syndemics of co-circulating respiratory viruses and chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) that can exacerbate viral infections. We will infer viral transmission rates and socio-environmental risk cofactors by fitting the model to respiratory disease data extracted from millions of electronic health records (EHRs) for the last nine years. We will then partner with clinical and EHR experts to translate our models into the first outbreak detection system for severe respiratory viruses that incorporates EHR data on CRDs. Using machine learning techniques, we will further integrate other surveillance, environmental, behavioral and internet predictor data sources to maximize the accuracy, sensitivity, speed and population coverage of our algorithms. In Aim 3, we will develop an open-access Python toolkit to facilitate the integration of next generation data into outbreak surveillance models. This project will produce practical early warning algorithms for detecting emerging viral threats at high spatiotemporal resolution in several US cities, elucidate socio-geographic gaps in current surveillance systems and hotspots for viral emergence, and provide a robust design framework for extrapolating these algorithms to other US cities. Project Narrative We will develop innovative algorithms for detecting emerging respiratory viruses within US cities. To do so, we will model the syndemic dynamics of respiratory viruses and chronic respiratory diseases and apply machine learning to combine geospatial data that track early indicators of emerging threats. Working with local public health and healthcare collaborators, we will translate this research into practical tools for addressing socio- geographic gaps in surveillance and accelerating the detection, prevention and mitigation of severe outbreaks.","Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data",9946212,R01AI151176,"['Absenteeism', 'Address', 'African', 'Age', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Articulation', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Disease model', 'Ebola', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Pythons', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'austin', 'base', 'cofactor', 'comorbidity', 'dashboard', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'diverse data', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiological model', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'health care availability', 'health goals', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'influenza outbreak', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metropolitan', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pandemic disease', 'public health intervention', 'respiratory virus', 'school district', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'social media', 'sociodemographic group', 'socioeconomics', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'user-friendly', 'viral transmission']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,611043,0.024803703988782573
"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: expanding dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches for pandemic scenarios PROJECT SUMMARY The emergence and global expansion of SARS-CoV-2 as a human pathogen over the last four months represents a nearly unprecedented challenge for the infectious disease modelling community. This pandemic has benefitted from huge volumes of data being generated, but the rate of dissemination of these data has often outpaced existing data pipelines. While the last decade has seen significant advances in real-time infectious disease forecasting — spurred by rapid growth in data and computational methods — these methods have primarily focused on seasonal endemic diseases based, are based on historical data, and so do not apply easily to this novel pathogen, or to pandemic scenarios. New methods are needed to leverage the wealth of surveillance data at fine spatial granularity, together with associated information about policy interventions and environmental conditions over space and time, to reason directly about the mechanisms to forecast and understand the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. These methods must use sound statistical and epidemiological principles and be flexible and computationally efficient to provide real- time forecasts to guide public health decision-making and respond to changing aspects of this global crisis. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop scalable, computationally efficient Bayesian hierarchical compartmental models to flexibly respond to state-level public health forecasting needs, and (2) to design models and conduct analyses to draw robust inference about the effectiveness of interventions in impacting the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections within the US to build an evidence-base for continued responses to COVID-19 and future pandemics. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an emerging public health crisis. A fundamental challenge is how to turn data into evidence that can inform decision-making about managing resources, improving health outcomes, and controlling further spread of SARS-CoV-2. Real-time forecasting and flexible mechanistic models to understand the disease dynamics can provide policy-makers tools to manage public response. The goal of the proposed research is to adapt existing statistical modeling frameworks and develop new ones for making forecasts of COVID-19 in real-time and integrating these forecasts into public health decision making.",Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: expanding dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches for pandemic scenarios,10150377,R35GM119582,"['2019-nCoV', 'Award', 'Budgets', 'COVID-19', 'Calibration', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Fever', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Endemic Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza prevention', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Programmed Learning', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Social Distance', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thailand', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'data dissemination', 'data pipeline', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'influenza epidemic', 'machine learning method', 'model design', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'rapid growth', 'real world application', 'reproductive', 'response', 'seasonal influenza', 'sound', 'statistical and machine learning', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R35,2020,78507,0.06999131895466959
"BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19 Abstract With South Carolina’s population already being vulnerable to poor health as evidenced by poor national health rankings, challenging rural geography and health professional shortages, the impact of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be long lasting in the state. Patient morbidity and mortality rates already continue to increase, with ongoing economic damage to health systems and businesses. The speed of transmission and geographical spread of COVID-19 across South Carolina and the United States is alarming, which combined with the novel nature of the disease justifies the need for accelerated research to combat this pandemic. As clinicians and frontline health workers battle to save lives, creating a data environment that accelerates research is key, and necessary to battle the disease. Access to such information will equip frontline health workers to continue the fight against the disease. This proposal will build the capacity for accelerated research and intelligence gathering by coalescing multiple state partners and leveraging relevant data for discoveries around COVID-19. To accomplish this, this proposal aims to (1) create a de-identified linked database system via REDCap and a mobile application (app) to collate surveillance, clinical, multi-omics and geospatial data on both COVID-19 patients and health workers treating COVID-19 patients in South Carolina; (2) examine the natural history of COVID-19 including transmission dynamics, disease progression, and geospatial visualization; and (3) identify important predictors of short- and long-term clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in South Carolina using machine learning algorithms. These aims will be accomplished through collaborations with multiple state agencies and stakeholders relevant to COVID-19 and the creation of a REDCap database and mobile app that allow for coalescing relevant data in a timely fashion, combined with leveraging of statewide integrated data warehouse capabilities. Project Narrative COVID-19 represents an opportunity to create and deploy a research system that allows accelerated research on any pandemic. While South Carolina is rural in nature, and has low health rankings, it has a powerful integrated health data infrastructure that allows for tracking short-and long-term clinical and health system impacts of pandemics like the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The creation of multiple data sources at the individual level, coupled with innovative big data science techniques will advance important discoveries in disease surveillance, transmission, natural history and progression important for treatment and necessary for targeted intervention purposes in South Carolina.","BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19",10136980,R01AI127203,"['2019-nCoV', 'Active Learning', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Common Cold', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality of Patient Information', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Sources', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Partners', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Provider', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rural', 'SARS coronavirus', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Source', 'South Carolina', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Virus', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'big-data science', 'combat', 'data infrastructure', 'data management', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'disability', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene therapy', 'health data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data sources', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel coronavirus', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'patient privacy', 'precision medicine', 'response', 'systems research', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'virology']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2020,626275,0.015304505293598336
"Dynamic learning for post-vaccine event prediction using temporal information in VAERS Project Summary Vaccines have been one of the most successful public health interventions to date. They are, however, pharmaceutical products that carry risks. Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine- preventable illnesses. The CDC/FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) contains up to 30,000 reports per year over the past 25 years. VAERS reports include both structured data (e.g., vaccination date, first onset date, age, and gender) and unstructured narratives that often provide detailed clinical information about the clinical events and the temporal relationship of the series of event occurrences post vaccination. The structured data only provide one onsite date whereas temporal information of the sequence of events post vaccination is contained in the unstructured narratives. Current status –While structured data in the VAERS are widely used, the narratives are generally ignored because of the challenges inherent in working with unstructured data. Without these narratives, potentially valuable information is lost. Goals - In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs. Specifically, built upon the state-of-art ontology and natural language processing technologies, we will develop and validate a Temporal Information Modeling, Extraction and Reasoning system for Vaccine data (TIMER-V), which will automatically extract post-vaccination events and their temporal relationships from VAERS reports, semantically infer temporal relations, and integrate the exacted unstructured data with the structured data. Furthermore, we will provide and maintain a publicly available data access interface to query the new integrated data repository, which will facilitate vaccine safety research, casual inference, and other temporal related discovery. We will also develop and validate models to predict severe AEs using the co-occurrence or temporal patterns of the series of AEs post vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to make use of the unstructured narratives in the VAERS reports to facilitate the temporal related discovery to a broad community of investigators in pharmacology, pharmacoepidemiology, vaccine safety research, among others. Project Narrative Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine-preventable illnesses. In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. Currently the FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) only includes one onsite date in its database. The textual narratives in the reports are generally ignored primarily due to their unstructured nature. These narratives, however, contain more detailed information about the series of events that happened after vaccination, which could be valuable for more informed clinical studies. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs.

"High-Performance Compute Cluster for Comprehensive Cancer and Infectious Diseases Research Project Summary/Abstract Fred Hutch respectfully requests funds to upgrade the current 523-node, 3328-core high performance computing (HPC) cluster, which was created in 2004 and expanded in 2006, 2010 (S10 funds), 2013, 2015 (S10 funds), and 2018. 456 end of life nodes (1824 cores) will be replaced and 144 nodes (3456 cores) will be added, creating a new 211-node, 4996-core system with an overall 50% increase in core count, 60% increase in processing power, and more than 100% increase in memory capacity over the old system. The expanded capacity will enable deep and efficient analysis of our research studies and accommodate 20% annual growth in computing intensive research, much of which is not possible on the current cluster. The core user group for the new HPC cluster consists of at least 37 NIH-funded research groups participating in this proposal, however as much as 85 groups use the cluster regularly. Their biomedical research is aimed at eradicating cancer and other diseases and dependent on computationally intensive technical approaches such as development of novel statistical analysis or machine learning methods, for example for assessing immune correlates to facilitate vaccine development, analyzing large scale clinical trials or to develop software tools for the analysis of large-scale immunological datasets, DNA and RNA sequencing, modeling prostate cancer outcomes, studies of the human microbiome, modeling of cancers, mRNA, miRNA, and structural variant detection, structural biology with Cryo- EM, modeling of infectious agents and pandemics, computational modeling, prediction and design of macromolecular structures and interactions, identifying drivers of neoplasia and an international consortium improving colorectal cancer detection using GWAS, whole genome sequencing and genome-wide gene- environment (GxE) studies as well as research in diabetes, mhealth and cardiovascular diseases. Several of the Major Users at Fred Hutch are currently experiencing substantial delays in accomplishing their work using the current cluster. Others have projects that cannot be done at all on the existing instrument. (see Research Projects section for details). The Scientific Computing department (SciComp) has operated the current HPC cluster for more than 10 years and has a staff with a combined experience of over 150 years. The proposed new HPC cluster will be installed in available space in a Fred Hutch datacenter. The expanded cluster will address both immediate and future needs of our user community, supporting NIH-funded research at Fred Hutch. Funded research at our Center will greatly benefit from the increased data-processing capacity and improved performance of the requested HPC cluster, including applications of machine learning to the study of clinical trial efficacy, comparison of immune system receptors to identify responses to specific pathogens/diseases, modeling of carcinogenesis. Besides multiple infectious diseases Fred Hutch researches all types of cancer and our computationally intensive investigators tend to focus on colon, prostate, brain, Barrett’s esophagus, lung and liquid tumors such as leukemia. Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance) We are requesting an expansion of our high-performance computing (HPC) cluster to provide capacity for the growing computational needs in a broad range of biomedical research studies at our Center. Access to fast and reliable computational power is critically important for analyzing the exploding amounts of data produced by large-scale clinical and epidemiological studies, as well as scientific instruments such as genome sequencers and electron microscopes.

"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Development of a Universal Influenza Vaccine ABSTRACT Influenza virus (flu) ranks highest in disease burden of all infectious diseases as measured in disability-adjusted life years. Seasonal epidemics cause 200,000-500,000 worldwide deaths annually. The total economic burden of seasonal flu is estimated to range from approximately $26B to $87B each year in the US in terms of direct medical expenses and lost work and productivity. Additionally, at least six known flu pandemics have become global human catastrophes, most notably the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, which killed 3-5% of the world’s population. Any reduction in the infection rate, transmission, and severity of flu infection would greatly reduce our healthcare expenditures and improve the quality of life for millions of people every year. The current vaccines are formulated annually based on predictions of which circulating flu strains may be prevalent in a given season. The effectiveness of these vaccines varies from year to year based on the circulation of unexpected antigenic variants and other factors. Vaccine design is complicated the by the multiplicity of flu strains, each with rapidly-evolving dominant antigen epitopes (“decoy” epitopes) that largely stimulate strain- restricted immunity. One strategy for rational antigen design, termed Immune Refocusing Technology (IRT), involves introducing mutations that reduce the immunogenicity of these decoy epitopes thus shifting the immune response to target more widely-conserved subdominant epitopes. BMI has previously applied this IRT approach with some notable successes to other viral antigens (e.g. HRV and the RSV F protein), and we now focus on the major flu surface antigen glycoprotein HA using H1, H3, and B vaccine strains as parental antigens. The anticipated effort to design a suitably modified antigen would ordinarily involve a protracted process of trial-and-error testing of many potential candidates. However, we have recently developed the ANATOPE automated B cell epitope prediction software package with algorithm parameters tuned using methods in artificial intelligence. Our algorithm identifies epitopes with a significantly higher success rate than previously available prediction programs. This breakthrough allows us to assign immunogenicity “strength” scores to particular antigen surface patches and will further guide and accelerate the design of mutant antigens that refocus the immune response to cross-strain conserved epitopes. In this application, we propose to engineer and test the immunogenicity of rationally-designed HA antigens containing mutations that both 1) dampen the immunogenicity of dominant strain-restricted decoy epitopes and 2) enhance the immunogenicity of conserved subdominant epitopes associated with broadly neutralizing antibodies. Follow- up studies will assess the rationally-designed antigens in a ferret challenge study and prepare the approach for translation into humans as a universal vaccine that does not require annual reformulation. NARRATIVE Influenza is among the most important pathogens in terms of negative impact upon human health and healthcare expense. The current seasonal vaccines have a mixed record in terms of preventing illness and death. Development of improved vaccines is complicated by the rapid antigenic evolution of circulating viruses and the strain-restricted protections developed by our immune systems. In this proposal, we combine two novel technologies to develop universal influenza vaccines. The first, the Immune Refocusing Technology, is used to alter antibody binding sites, epitopes, such that the immune system can produce a broadened, cross-strain protective response. The second, a computational B cell epitope analysis program called ANATOPE, is used to guide the rational design of antigenic mutants bearing amino acid substitutions that stimulate improved immune responses. This project will focus on improving the breadth of protection stimulated by the three major components of the seasonal vaccine to reduce the need for annual reformulations. If successful, follow-up studies will include additional analysis in alternative animal models, a more comprehensive analysis of T cell immune responses, and preparation for advancement into IND-enabling studies.",Development of a Universal Influenza Vaccine,10080771,R43AI152652,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing Alternatives', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Binding Sites', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Baculoviruses', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Circulation', 'California', 'Cells', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Economic Burden', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Epitopes', 'Evolution', 'Ferrets', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Ha antigen', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hemagglutination', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hong Kong', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Insecta', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Recombinants', 'Seasons', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Serological', 'Severities', 'Singapore', 'Site', 'Spanish flu', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surface Antigens', 'Switzerland', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Translations', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral Antibodies', 'Viral Antigens', 'Viral Physiology', 'Virus', 'Work', 'antiviral immunity', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'flu', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'infection rate', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'mutant', 'neutralizing antibody', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'seasonal influenza', 'success', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine', 'vaccine effectiveness']",NIAID,"BIOLOGICAL MIMETICS, INC.",R43,2020,299218,0.058973774335789646
"Defining humoral correlates of immunity against COVID-19 Since 2002, several coronaviruses have emerged able to cause severe respiratory disease, however no vaccine is available to prevent these rapidly spreading pathogens. Vaccine design has specifically lagged due to our lack of understanding of the correlates of immunity against these pathogens. Both cellular and humoral immune responses have been implicated in resolution of disease, but to date only the passive transfer of antibodies has been shown to confer complete protection in mice. Interestingly, the transfer of both “neutralizing” and non- neutralizing antibodies have shown protective efficacy, highlighting the role of multiple humoral mechanisms in limiting viral infection/spread. The precise mechanism of action of these antibodies that have the most profound impact on limiting disease is currently unclear, but if elucidated could provide critical insights for the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19 and other coronaviruses. Thus, here we aim to take a systematic approach to dissect and define both the polyclonal and monoclonal mechanisms by which antibodies confer protection against COVID-19. Specifically, samples from DNA- and adenovirus 26 (Ad26)- COVID-19 Spike protein (S) immunized animals, that will be challenged with COVID-19, will be comprehensively profiled using Systems Serology, to define the functional humoral immune responses linked to protection from infection/disease in mice, ferrets, and macaques. Machine learning modeling will be employed to discern key immune response features that translate usefully across these diverse animal contexts. Coupled to a novel systems-Fc-engineering approach, the COVID-19 CR3022 monoclonal antibody will be engineered to specifically define the Fc-effector functions that provide the greatest impact on limiting disease. Collectively, these studies will not only define correlates of immunity across vaccines and species, but also provide mechanistic insights into the precise mechanisms by which antibodies may confer protection in the context of future vaccines.

"Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem, and current drug pipelines are not keeping pace with the rise of antimicrobial resistance. An alternative strategy is to boost host immunity. An often overlooked side-effect of the vitamin and mineral supplementation projects of the 1940s is that these supplements greatly reduced infectious disease burden. Recent work has shown that further gains may be possible, especially in adding phytochemicals back to highly processed diets typically consumed in the United States. However, we lack a fundamental understanding of how these components are processed by the microbiome, and how diet-derived molecules, microbiome and host immune system work together to resist infectious disease. A key barrier preventing us from making these discoveries is that each individual assay (microbiome, host gene expression metabolome, dietary compounds) is expensive and highly multivariate. Three key insights that enable the current project are the miniaturization of DNA and RNA sequencing assays on advanced nanoliter- scale liquid handling robots, greatly reducing the cost, the combination of untargeted and targeted mass spectrometry on the same samples in high throughput to enable discovery of a much greater chemical space, and the ability to use explicitly spatial maps on multiple scales to integrate the dataset throughout the body and enable both visual analytics and deep learning approaches based on spatial data. These breakthroughs will provide a fundamentally new understanding of how dietary metabolites promote disease resistance, and will allow us to develop a new infrastructure to integrate results from many investigators in different laboratories studying various aspects of these systems. Additionally, the results will allow us to choose biomaterials and biomarkers in human subjects that provide maximum information about internal nutritional and immune status. Results will be tested against the NHANES and American Gut cohorts. The results of this project will therefore be: 3D maps of mouse models showing how the microbiome, diet, and host gene expression produce immunity; an infrastructure for creating and sharing these maps; and a preliminary test of whether the results extend to large human populations. Project Narrative The public health relevance of this proposal is that it will provide an infrastructure for analyzing impacts of dietary components and microbiomes throughout the body. The analysis of these maps will help us identify dietary components that improve resistance to infectious disease.",Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity,10015205,DP1AT010885,"['3-Dimensional', 'American', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Back', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consumption', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dietary Component', 'Disease Resistance', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratory Study', 'Liquid substance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Microbe', 'Minerals', 'Miniaturization', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutritional status', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phytochemical', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Robot', 'Sampling', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Vitamins', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'human subject', 'immunological status', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'microbiome', 'mouse model', 'nanolitre scale', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'side effect', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCCIH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",DP1,2020,885000,0.020955071515438396
"Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity PROJECT SUMMARY Reliable and real-time municipality-level predictive modeling and forecasts of infectious disease activity have the potential to transform the way public health decision-makers design interventions such as information campaigns, preemptive/reactive vaccinations, and vector control, in the presence of health threats across the world. While the links between disease activity and factors such as: human mobility, climate and environmental factors, socio-economic determinants, and social media activity have long been known in the epidemic literature, few efforts have focused on the evident need of developing an open-source platform capable of leveraging multiple data sources, factors, and disparate modeling methodologies, across a large and heterogeneous nation to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over four geographic scales (nation, state, city, and municipal). The overall goal of this project is to develop such a platform. Our long-term goal is to investigate effective ways to incorporate the findings from multiple disparate studies on disease dynamics around the globe with local and global factors such as weather conditions, socio- economic status, satellite imagery and online human behavior, to develop an operational, robust, and real- time data-driven disease forecasting platform. The objective of this grant is to leverage the expertise of three complementary scientific research teams and a wealth of information from a diverse array of data sources to build a modeling platform capable of combining information to produce real-time short term disease forecasts at the local level. As part of this, we will evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales--nation, state, city, and municipality--using Brazil as a test case. Additionally, we will use machine learning and mechanistic models to understand disease dynamics at multiple spatial scales, across a heterogeneous country such as Brazil. Our specific aims will (1) Assess the utility of individual data streams and modeling techniques for disease forecasting; (2) Fuse modeling techniques and data streams to improve accuracy and robustness at the four spatial scales; (3) Characterize the basic computational infrastructure necessary to build an operational disease forecasting platform; and (4) Validate our approach in a real-world setting. This contribution is significant because It will advance our scientific knowledge on the accuracy and limitations of disparate data streams and multiple modeling approaches when used to forecast disease transmission. Our efforts will help produce operational and systematic disease forecasts at a local level (city- and municipality-level). Moreover, we aim at building a new open-source computational platform for the epidemiological community to use as a knowledge discovery tool. Finally, we aim at developing this platform under the guidance of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) panel comprising of WHO, CDC, academics, and local and federal stakeholders within Brazil. The proposed approach is innovative because few efforts have focused on developing an open-source computational platform capable of combining disparate data sources and drivers, across a heterogeneous and large nation, into multiple modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over multiple geographic scales.. In addition, we propose to investigate how to best combine modeling approaches that have, to this date, been developed and interpreted independently, namely, traditional epidemiological mechanistic models and novel machine-learning predictive models, in order to produce accurate and robust real-time disease activity estimates and forecasts. Project Narrative The proposed research is of crucial importance to public health surveillance and preparedness communities because it seeks to identify effective ways to utilize previously disconnected results, that have pointed out links between disease spread and factors such as socio-economic status, local weather conditions, human mobility, social media activity, to build an open-source and data driven, modeling platform capable of extracting and disseminating information from disparate data sources, and complementary modeling approaches, to (1) Evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales: nation, state, city, and municipality; (2) Fuse complementary modeling approaches that have been developed independently and oftentimes not used in conjunction; (3) produce real- time and short term forecasts of disease activity in multiple geographic scales across a heterogeneous and large nation like Brazil.",Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity,10000112,R01GM130668,"['Area', 'Assimilations', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Brazil', 'Burn injury', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dengue', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Municipalities', 'Population Surveillance', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'Vaccination', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Water', 'Weather', 'Work', 'ZIKA', 'base', 'chikungunya', 'climate variability', 'computational platform', 'computer infrastructure', 'data infrastructure', 'data modeling', 'data streams', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'economic determinant', 'experience', 'flu', 'genomic data', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'social media', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'spreading factor', 'therapy design', 'time use', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'vector control', 'vector-borne']",NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,365601,0.02816458480719277
"Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data ABSTRACT Since early January 2020, our interdisciplinary research team has conducted several studies to elucidate the emerging threat of COVID-19 and support public health responses throughout the United States, resulting in peer-reviewed publications, online COVID-19 forecasting tools, and extensive engagement with city, state and national decision makers. In our collaboration with the CDC to develop a national modeling resource for pandemic preparedness, we had recently developed a national model for evaluating multi-layered intervention strategies to contain and mitigate outbreaks in US cities. We adapted the model to COVID-19 by incorporating the latest estimates for age- and risk-group specific rates of transmission, disease progression, asymptomatic infections, and severity (including risks of hospitalization, critical care, ventilation and death). The model is designed to flexibly incorporate combinations of social distancing, contact tracing-isolation, antiviral prophylaxis and treatment, as well as vaccination strategies. Our Supplementary Aims propose to build a more granular and data-driven model of COVID-19 to elucidate the transmission, identify high-risk populations, surveillance targets and effective control of this and future epidemics within US cities. Aim S1: Focusing initially on the Austin-Round Rock metropolitan area in Texas, we will apply these models to improve real-time risk assessments and optimize the timing and extent of layered social distancing measures. Aim S2: We will rapidly evaluate strategies for rolling out antiviral prophylaxis and therapy based on clinical trial data. Aim S3: We will develop user interfaces for our Austin and national models to support both scientific research and public health efforts to mitigate COVID-19 and plan for future pandemic threats. These Aims are synergistic with Specific Aim 2 of our parent grant (R01 AI151176-01), in which we are developing high-resolution models of viral transmission to improve the early detection and control of anomalous respiratory viruses, particularly in at risk populations. NARRATIVE Our Supplementary Aims will accelerate the development of a flexible and granular model of COVID-19 emergence, transmission and control within US cities. Leveraging unprecedented data and a high level engagement with city and state leadership in the Austin-Round Rock MSA and Texas, we will rapidly improve our existing models to evaluate strategies for real-time surveillance and multifaceted interventions including non-pharmaceutical measures (eg, adaptive social distancing and cocooning of high risk populations) as well as future antiviral drugs to mitigate COVID-19. Finally, we will develop user-friendly interfaces for our models to support research and public health decision making for COVID-19 and future pandemic threats.","Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data",10150283,R01AI151176,"['Age', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'COVID-19', 'Categories', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Cities', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Contact Tracing', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Surveillance', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Social Distance', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'United States', 'Update', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Visualization', 'austin', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'multi-component intervention', 'pandemic disease', 'pandemic preparedness', 'parent grant', 'prevent', 'respiratory virus', 'response', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly', 'vaccination strategy', 'ventilation', 'viral transmission']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,387199,0.01006251647382004
"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary:  Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has created a major public health crisis around the world. The novel coronavirus was observed to have a long incubation period and extremely infectious during this period. No proven effective treatment or vaccine is available. Massive public interventions have been implemented in many countries and states in the United States (US) at different phases of the outbreak with varying combinations of social dis- tancing, mobility restriction and population behavioral change. Decisions on how to implement these interventions (e.g., when to impose and relax mitigation measures) rely on important statistics of COVID epidemiology (e.g., effective reproduction number) that characterize and predict the course of COVID-19 outbreak. However, there is a lack of robust and parsimonious model of COVID epidemic that can accurately reﬂect the heterogeneity between susceptible populations and regions (e.g., demographics, healthcare capacity, social and economic determinants). There is no rigorous study to guide precision public health interventions that are tailored to a population or region depending on their characteristics. Furthermore, due to the non-randomized nature of public health interventions, it is critical to account for biases and confounding when comparing mitigation measures of COVID-19 across re- gions. To address these challenges, this project develops robust and generalizable analytic methods to evaluate public health interventions and assess individual patient risks of COVID-19 infection and complications. In Aim 1, we will develop dynamic and robust statistical models to predict the disease epidemic. The models will estimate the date of the ﬁrst unknown infection case, instantaneous effective reproduction number, and account for the incu- bation period of COVID-19 virus. Furthermore, heterogeneity in population's demographics, social and economic indicators, healthcare capacity and geographic locations will be incorporated to reﬂect their impacts on COVID epidemic. Under a longitudinal quasi-experimental design, we will provide valid inference for comparing public health interventions implemented at different regions while accounting for confounding bias. Multiple sources of data from different states in the US will be analyzed to empirically test which states' response strategies are more effective and in which subpopulation. In Aim 2, we will focus on developing precise risk assessment tool of individ- ual COVID-19 patients using electronic health records (EHRs) collected at New York Presbyterian hospital in New York City, an epicenter of COVID-19. We will engineer features of patient's pre-conditions associated with severe COVID complications, recovery, or death. More importantly, we will engineer features that represent proxies of virus exposures from patients' geographic information. We will use machine learning techniques to create quantitative summaries of patient prognosis (e.g., transitioning to serious clinical stages, discharge, death). We will use inter- nal cross-validation and external calibration to validate developed algorithms. The project will generate evidence to guide precision public health intervention, optimal patient care, and efﬁcient healthcare resource allocation in anticipation of a second wave of COVID epidemic and in preparation of other infectious disease outbreaks. Project Narrative:  This project aims to develop robust and generalizable analytics to evaluate public health interventions in response to coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic and to assess individual patient risks using multiple sources of data (e.g., ofﬁcial reports of COVID cases, electronic health records). The project will provide quantita- tive evidence to guide precision public health interventions at the right time for the right subpopulation to effectively contain and mitigate the outbreak. It will also provide quantitative risk assessments of COVID-19 patients to facili- tate best clinical management and optimal allocation of heathcare resources.",Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data,10161345,R01GM124104,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Country', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Parents', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preparation', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Reproduction', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severities', 'Social Distance', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'analytical method', 'big biomedical data', 'coronavirus disease', 'demographics', 'design', 'disease transmission', 'disorder risk', 'economic determinant', 'economic indicator', 'effective therapy', 'epidemiological model', 'high risk population', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model building', 'mortality', 'multiple data sources', 'novel coronavirus', 'outcome forecast', 'pandemic disease', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'public health intervention', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'social determinants', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'vector', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,331147,0.01176175507419843
"Improving predictive capacity of models for universal influenza vaccine development The need for improved and more universally protective influenza vaccines is well recognized. Central to efforts towards improvements is the development of animal models more predictive of the human response to immunization and/or infection. Indeed, this need has been highlighted by the NIAID Strategic Plan for a Universal Influenza Vaccine. While animal models may never be able to fully predict the human response, understanding their full strengths and weaknesses and identifying the optimal models for different purposes is a significant public health need and is the scientific premise behind our proposed objectives. These objectives, which are built upon our extensive use of influenza animal models, are to optimize animal modeling of immunologic imprinting, to improve vaccine efficacy testing, and to identify immune correlates of protection and boosting immune responses. Our overall goal is to provide superior preclinical models to support universal influenza vaccine development. We will achieve this goal through three complementary and interrelated specific aims, 1) optimal modeling of human serologic responses to repeat influenza antigen exposure in animal models; 2) improving the quantitative nature of the ferret influenza challenge model; and 3) defining serologic correlates of influenza virus induced clinical symptoms. Our ability to conduct these aims is supported through our participation in, and collaboration with, a recently NIAID-funded human infant cohort, the DIVINCI study. We will mirror the influenza antigen exposures of a selection of these infants in three animal models and compare immunologic data sets to identify which most accurately reflects the human response (Aim 1). This marriage of human and animal data sets and samples offers an innovative way forward and will provide a unique set of differentially primed animals with which to determine immune correlates of novel physiologic parameters of infection and immune responses (Aim 2) using original machine learning algorithms (Aim 3). Current models for influenza vaccine development suffer from poor predictability of the human response. Through an innovative combination of approaches that use data from longitudinal human cohorts, we intend to greatly enhance the reliability and value of these models in universal influenza vaccine testing.",Improving predictive capacity of models for universal influenza vaccine development,9950635,R01AI150745,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Cavia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Ferrets', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hamsters', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype', 'Information Systems', 'Lasso', 'Lung', 'Marriage', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Predictive Value', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reagent', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Serological', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'Upper respiratory tract', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccine Production', 'Vaccines', 'Virulence', 'Virus Replication', 'Whole Body Plethysmography', 'animal data', 'animal model development', 'cohort', 'efficacy testing', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'human model', 'imprint', 'improved', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse development', 'multitask', 'next generation', 'novel', 'preclinical evaluation', 'product development', 'research and development', 'response', 'safety study', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine evaluation']",NIAID,ST.

"Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology Project Summary Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. IAVs can cause infections in birds, sea mammals, lower mammals (e.g., pigs, dogs, and horses), and humans. Previous studies have demonstrated that the structures of the carbohydrate receptors determine influenza host and tissue tropisms. Thus, it is necessary to understand the receptor- binding properties for IAVs and monitor changes to them, especially for IAVs at the animal–human interface. However, this understanding is hampered by our lack of detailed knowledge of IAV glycan substructures; most of our knowledge is limited to SA2,3Gal-like and SA2,6Gal-like structures. The goals of this project are to develop and validate a machine learning method to identify host-specific glycan substructures for IAVs by using glycan array data and to identify and validate the glycan motifs associated with the host tropisms of IAVs, including those for zoonotic IAVs. The study will focus on natural hosts of IAVs: humans, swine, canines, equines, and various avian species, including common domestic poultry species and wild bird species. We expect to identify structural determinants for receptor binding with human-, swine-, canine-, and avian-origin IAVs. Such knowledge will help us understand the factors that contribute to influenza infection and transmission and thereby facilitate development of an effective influenza vaccine to prevent virus infection and block virus transmission. This knowledge will also help us develop rapid assays for monitoring emerging influenza threats at the animal–human interface. We also expect to develop a computational method for identifying glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms; this method will be able to be adapted to determine functional glycan motifs for other proteins, lectins, antibodies, antisera, and microorganisms, including those of other infectious pathogens, by using glycan arrays. Project Narrative This project will develop and apply a computational tool to identify glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms, and the derived knowledge will help us develop effective strategies for influenza prevention and control.",Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology,9895377,R21AI144433,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza A Virus', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biosensor', 'Birds', 'Canis familiaris', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Domestic Fowls', 'Equus caballus', 'Family suidae', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune Sera', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lectin', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural History', 'Pathogenesis', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sea', 'Sialic Acids', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Strategic Planning', 'Streptavidin', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Tropism', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virus Diseases', 'Zoonoses', 'base', 'carbohydrate receptor', 'carbohydrate structure', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flu transmission', 'improved', 'in silico', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'microorganism', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'protein profiling', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'respiratory', 'response', 'swine influenza', 'tissue tropism', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'viral transmission', 'wild bird']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2020,239725,-0.010093926507465798
"Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO) Project Summary In recent decades, Central and South America have experienced spillover of endemic arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) from wildlife reservoirs into humans, exchange and recombination of emerging arboviruses within the region, resurgence of arboviruses previously controlled by vaccination or vector control, introduction and spread of novel arboviruses, and exportation of viruses to other regions. Furthermore, there is great concern that newly-introduced Zika virus may spill back into an enzootic transmission cycle in the Americas. Central and South America encompass enormous vertebrate and invertebrate biodiversity, and these species harbor a broad range of arboviruses whose risk of spillover and spread in humans is presently unknown. Increases in the rates of global travel, invasion of novel vector species, urban expansion, deforestation, and global climate change all elevate the risk of further arbovirus emergence, as does the breakdown of public health structures in Venezuela.  The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE- NEO) project will provide a network of surveillance sites in the neotropics coupled to cutting-edge modeling approaches in order to anticipate and counter emerging arboviruses. Aim 1 will identify novel and known arboviruses as well as the host-vector networks that sustain transmission of these viruses within the neotropics, map the spatial distribution of these transmission networks, and characterize virus transmission dynamics within these networks. To do so, we will collect mosquitoes and other vectors as well as non-human primates and other vertebrate hosts at multiple sites in areas of high and varied biodiversity in Panama and Brazil and screen these samples for known and novel arboviruses. These data will then be analyzed using niche modeling, machine learning to predict undiscovered hosts and vectors, and dynamical transmission models. Aim 2 will focus on prospective and retrospective analysis of human infection and disease. To do so, we will leverage ongoing human clinical cohorts at multiple sites in Brazil and Panama. We will extend and expand these cohorts, with a particular focus on the immune-mediated interactions among multiple arboviruses at sites of hyperendemicity. We will also develop novel diagnostics to capture known and novel arboviruses and model the impact of human and non-human primate movement on spillover and spillback of target arboviruses.  Data and models generated via these two aims will forewarn local, regional and global public health agencies of arboviruses within Central and South America that pose particularly high risk of spillover, emergence into transmission among humans, and/or international spread. Moreover CREATE-NEO will build local capacity to predict, detect and respond to emerging arboviruses at their point of origin, thereby maximizing the potential to avert full-blown emergence. Project Narrative Arthropod-borne viruses, such as dengue, Zika and Mayaro, are emerging at an accelerating rate in Central and South America.

"Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots  Emergence of undervaccinated geographical clusters for diseases like measles has become a national concern. A number of measles outbreaks have occurred in recent months, despite high MMR coverage in the United States ( 95%). Such undervaccinated clusters can act as reservoirs of infection that can transmit the disease to a wider population, magnifying their importance far beyond what their absolute numbers might indicate. The existence and growth of such undervaccinated clusters is often known to public health agencies and health provider networks, but they typically do not have enough resources to target people in each such cluster, to attempt to improve the vaccination rate. Preliminary results show that not all undervaccinated clusters are “equal” in terms of their potential for causing a big outbreak (referred to as its “criticality”), and the rate of undervaccination in a cluster does not necessarily correlate with its criticality.  However, there are no existing methods to estimate the potential risk of such clusters, and to identify the most “critical” ones. Some of the key reasons are: (i) purely data-driven spatial statistics methods rely only on immunization coverage, which does not give any indication of the risk of an outbreak; and (ii) current causal epidemic models need to be combined with detailed incidence data, which has not been easily available.  This proposal brings together a systems science approach, combining agent-based stochastic epidemic models, and techniques from machine learning, high performance computing, data mining, and spatial statistics, along with novel public and private datasets on immunization and incidence, to develop a novel methodology for identifying critical clusters, through the following tasks: (i) Identify spatial clusters with signiﬁcantly low immunization rates, or strong anti-vaccine sentiment; (ii) Develop an agent based model for the spread of measles that incorporates detailed immunization data, and is calibrated using a novel source of incidence data; (iii) Develop methods to ﬁnd and characterize critical spatial clusters, with respect to different metrics, which capture both epidemic and economic burden, and order underimmunized clusters based on their criticality; and (iv) Use the methodology to evaluate interventions in terms of their effect on criticality. A highly interdisciplinary team involving two universities, a health care delivery organization and a state department of Health, will work together to develop this methodology. Characterization of such clusters will enable public health departments and policy makers in targeted surveillance of their regions and a more efﬁcient allocation of resources. Project Narrative  This project will develop a new methodology to quantify the potential risks of under-vaccinated spatial clusters for highly infectious diseases. It will rank the clusters based on their economic and epidemic burden which will enable public health ofﬁcials in targeted surveillance and interventions, to mitigate their risk.",Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots,9887876,R01GM109718,"['Affect', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral Model', 'California', 'Characteristics', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Clusterings', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Herd Immunity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Immunization', 'Immunize', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'New Jersey', 'New York', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Privatization', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Resolution', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'diverse data', 'economic cost', 'economic outcome', 'health care delivery', 'health disparity', 'health organization', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'provider networks', 'public health intervention', 'social', 'social media', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2020,324178,0.015525201135268755
"Network modeling and robust estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient to inform the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials for infectious diseases 7. Project Summary/Abstract There is an urgent need to support research that generates high-quality evidence to inform clinical decision making. Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) achieve the highest standard of evidence for the evaluation of community-level effectiveness of intervention strategies against infectious diseases. However, there is a need to develop new methods to improve the design and analysis of CRTs because unique and complicated analytical challenges arise in such settings. One such issue relates to the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the degree to which individuals within a community are more similar to one another than to individuals in other communities. Design and analysis of CRTs must take into account the ICC. Lack of accurate information on the ICC jeopardizes the power of CRTs, leads to suboptimal choices of analysis methods and complicates the interpretation of study results. However, reliable information on the ICC is difficult to obtain. A robust and efficient approach for estimating ICCs is based on the second-order generalizing estimating equations. However, its use has been limited by considerable computational burden and poor convergence rates associated with the existing algorithms solving these equations. The first aim addresses these computational challenges. Missing data are ubiquitous and can lead to bias and loss of efficiency. The second aim proposes to develop novel robust and efficient methods for estimating ICCs in the presence of informative missing data. For infectious diseases, the underlying contact/transmission networks give rise to complicated correlation structure. The third aim is to develop network and epidemic models to project the ICC. User-friendly software will be developed to facilitate the implementation of new methods. An immediate application of the proposed methods is their application to the Botswana Combination Prevention Project to improve the estimation of intervention effect and to generate reliable ICC estimates for designing future CRTs in the same population. The proposed methods can be applied to other ongoing and future CRTs, and more broadly, to longitudinal studies and agreement studies where ICCs are also of great interest. The proposed research is significant, because success in addressing these issues will improve the ability to design efficient and well-powered CRTs and the precision in estimating the effects of intervention strategies. Innovation lies in the development of improved computing algorithms adapting approaches from deep learning, the use of semiparametric efficiency theory, and the integration of network modeling, epidemic modeling and statistical inference. The results of the proposed research will benefit both ongoing and future CRTs, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately expedite the control of infectious diseases. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because improved methodologies for the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials will benefit both ongoing and future studies, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately improve public health response intended to control the spread of infectious diseases.

"Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects around 50% of the US population. Even though the CMV exists in a latent state in healthy individuals, it profoundly shapes the immune system. Recent studies suggest that the CMV infection alters the immune response to influenza vaccine. However, the exact effect of CMV on the efficacy of the influenza vaccine remains controversial. In addition, how CMV shapes the immune responses toward other vaccines are unknown. We hypothesize that latent CMV infection induces critical changes in the immune system, which alters the efficacy of multiple types of vaccines. The ImmPort database currently hosts 133 vaccine studies, covering 21 types of vaccines, creating an unprecedented opportunity for us to test our hypothesis. We will perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to test the relationship between CMV and vaccine efficacies, and will use state-of-art statistical models (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian Network) to identify the mechanism by which CMV alters the vaccine response. Leveraging the group's expertise in computational immunology and rich datasets on ImmPort, we will address the following aims. Aim1: Test the effect of CMV on influenza vaccine outcome. We will perform a meta-analysis of 60 influenza studies available on ImmPort to test the impact of CMV. We will quantify and standardize the efficacy of influenza vaccine across studies, which are measured by hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assays before and after the vaccination. We will also determine the CMV infection status in subjects, either directly from serological tests or indirectly from immune- phenotyping data using cutting-edge machine learning tools. We will then test if CMV increases the response to influenza vaccine by analyzing data from all studies in a unified statistical framework while taking the heterogeneity between studies into account. Aim2: Bayesian network analysis of influenza vaccine response. We will harmonize multimodal immune-phenotyping data from the influenza vaccine studies, including transcriptomics data, cytometry data, and cytokine measurements. We will use state-of-art network analysis methods (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian network) to model the interplay between the immune components over time. Using the Bayesian network, we will investigate the mechanism by which CMV shapes the outcome of influenza vaccination. Aim3: Explore the effect of CMV infection on other vaccines. We will extend our analysis to vaccines other than influenza vaccine, (e.g., West Nile, Hepatitis B, yellow fever, malaria, and Tuberculosis). We will quantify the vaccine efficacy using assays specific to the vaccine type, such as Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) for the malaria vaccine and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test for the yellow fever vaccine. We will perform separate network analyses to characterize the relationship between CMV and the immune response of individual vaccines. We will then perform joint analysis across vaccine types to identify the common impact of CMV across vaccine types. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious diseases remain an urgent problem, resulting in an estimated 3 million deaths worldwide and more than 110,000 deaths in the United States annually, but the efficacy of vaccines against many infectious diseases remains suboptimal, including malaria, influenza, and dengue. To improve the vaccines, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect the immune response toward vaccines. In this study, we investigate how cytomegalovirus affects the efficacy of multiple vaccines, providing valuable information for improving the design of vaccines.",Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy,10026284,UH2AI153016,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections', 'Cytomegalovirus Vaccines', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatitis B', 'Herpesviridae', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Serologic tests', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Latency', 'West Nile virus', 'Yellow Fever', 'Yellow Fever Vaccine', 'cytokine', 'design', 'improved', 'individual response', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'malaria infection', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH2,2020,242126,0.019728662849548384
"Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease Challenge, Innovation and Impact: In recent years, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to predict epidemic disease outbreaks from retrospective seasonal and geographical case data and to show that we can take climate factors into account in our predictive models. We are moving closer to real-time prediction at the population level. But we have never used prediction at point-of-care for treating the individual patient.  Presently, personalized medicine uses delayed results of laboratory testing of individuals. For infectious disease, most of such testing has targeted the pathogen in the host-pathogen interaction. The role of laboratory testing is to modify therapy after a variable period of time delay. Personalized medicine today is reactive. Complicating matters further, many infectious epidemic diseases are strongly dependent on environmental factors and climate. Lastly, we want to name the pathogens we are fighting, but we really need to know the resistance characteristics to select therapy for patients effectively. Both speciation and resistance can now be determined from molecular data, which can be integrated into point-of-care treatment predictions.  We here propose a radically different approach to the treatment of infectious diseases. Our hypothesis is that the alternative to time-delayed and expensive laboratory analysis of specimens from individual patients, is to use predictive modeling to forecast point-of-care treatment. Time-delayed personalized testing can be conducted as surveillance, and that data used for real-time prediction to guide point-of-care treatment.  We will introduce predictive personalized public health (P3H) policy at the individual patient level, with the potential to substantially improve patient outcomes compared with our present reactive approaches. Our key rationale is to expand population infectious disease predictive modeling in order to achieve prediction for treatment at point-of-care. Our primary insight is that we can reposition the delayed reactive personalized testing from the urgent medical decision-making process, and into a predictive modeling framework. The gaps and opportunities in technology that we will address are four-fold. First, we will employ individual case geospatial mapping at a fine scale to take into account infection spread and environmental factors. Second, our ability to perform pan-microbial analysis using molecular techniques is now feasible. Third, modeling our novel fusion of data has no simple low-dimensional solution – but machine learning technologies are now capable of handling such big data assimilation, model discovery and prediction. Fourth, our proposal is not an academic exercise. We have a partnership with the economic planners within a developing country to design and implement our new methods. We will prospectively tune and validate our algorithms in real-time. Our deliverable will be an open-source framework ready for clinical trials testing and adaptation to the public health infrastructure in any country. Project Narrative We have made substantial progress in our abilities to track and predict infectious disease epidemics at the population level, but prediction has never been used at the individual level to guide treatment at point-of-care. The individual treatment for all infectious disease syndromes at point-of-care is presently empirical, because laboratory testing is reactive and time delayed. We here propose a novel framework to use rigorous prediction strategies to guide point-of-care treatment for infectious diseases, and to validate this approach under real-world conditions.",Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease,10006784,R01AI145057,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Assimilations', 'Bacterial Meningitis', 'Bacteriology', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cholera', 'Climate', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Exanthema', 'Exercise', 'Fever', 'Frequencies', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Hand', 'Health Policy', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Leptospirosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measles', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Melioidosis', 'Meningitis', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Newborn Infant', 'Paralysed', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uganda', 'Work', 'acute infection', 'antimicrobial', 'authority', 'climate data', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'data fusion', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'fighting', 'flu', 'global health', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infectious disease model', 'infectious disease treatment', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'neonatal infection', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'resistance gene', 'spreading factor', 'surveillance data']",NIAID,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2020,1627982,0.05457493493892239

"FluMod - Center for the Multiscale Modeling of Pandemic and seasonal Flu Prevention and Control PROJECT SUMMARY In this proposal we plan to contribute addressing the above foundational and operational challenges by advancing the science of influenza modeling and contributing novel methods and data sources that will increase the accuracy and availability of seasonal and pandemic influenza models. To address these challenges, we plan to build on the unique mechanistic spatially structured modeling approaches developed by our consortium, that includes stochastic metapopulation models and fully developed agent-based models nested together in our global epidemic and mobility modeling (GLEAM) approach. The objective of this project is to generate novel and actionable scientific insights from dynamic transmission models of influenza transmission that effectively integrate key socio-demographic indicators of the focus population, as well as a wide spectrum of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our proposed work in specific aim 1 (A1) will leverage our global modeling (from the global to local scale) framework that can be used to explore the multi-year impact of influenza vaccination, antiviral prophylaxis/treatment, and community mitigation during influenza seasons and pandemics. Our specific aim 2 (A2) will focus on using high quality data to model heterogeneous transmission drivers and novel contact pattern stratifications that will allow us to guide mitigation strategies and prioritization for interventions. In our Aim 3 (A3) we will use artificial intelligence approaches to identify interventions that are particularly synergistic and well-suited to particular epidemic scenarios, for seasonal and pandemic influenza. Our overarching goal is to provide a modeling portfolio with flexible and innovative mathematical and computational approaches. We aim to address several questions commonly asked about seasonal and pandemic influenza and match these with analytical methods and outbreak projections. The modeling and data developed in this project can help facilitate and justify transparent public health decisions, while contributing to the definition of standard methods for model selection and validation. Finally, our influenza modeling platform can also benefit the broader network of modeling teams and can be used to improve result sharing and harmonization of modeling approaches. The objective of this proposal is to advance the science of modeling and contribute novel methods and data analytics tools that will increase the understanding of seasonal and pandemic influenza in the context of the network of modeling teams coordinated by the CDC. To address these challenges, we plan to develop a novel global modeling framework, contribute new data and methods for improve the accuracy and validation of flu modeling approaches, and evolve successful methodologies to advance the analysis of layered intervention with artificial Intelligence.",FluMod - Center for the Multiscale Modeling of Pandemic and seasonal Flu Prevention and Control,10071782,U01IP001137,[' '],NCIRD,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,371721,0.016939991506331502
"An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. Project Summary / Abstract Diagnostic errors are increasingly recognized as a cause of pain, suffering and increased healthcare costs. Diagnostic delays are an important class of diagnostic errors. While many diagnostic errors occur in hospital settings, emergency departments visits may be especially important to consider because they treat critically ill patients and because most decisions to admit patients to the hospital are made in emergency departments. Thus, to enable a more complete understanding of diagnostic delays requires consideration of healthcare visits across a range of healthcare settings including clinic visits, emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Delays in diagnosing infectious diseases are important to consider. For contagious infectious diseases, diagnostic delays increase the risk of additional exposures, potentially generating more cases. Second, many infectious diseases can be effectively treated, but even short delays in treatment lead to worse clinical outcomes. However, with the exception of a few infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis), diagnostic delays for infectious diseases are understudied. Thus, there is a critical need to investigate the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact for diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. The overarching goal of our research is to investigate diagnostic delays associated with infectious diseases using existing data along with methods from the fields of computer science and statistics. While our research relies upon “big data”, we will also use clinical experts to review and contribute to all of our results. Our subject matter experts incorporate expertise in infectious diseases, emergency medicine, acute care, medical education, diagnostic reasoning, healthcare epidemiology, public health, industry, and professional infectious disease societies. Specifically, we will 1) determine the incidence of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases; 2) identify the risk factors associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases that are frequently delayed or have serious outcomes; and 3) estimate the impact of diagnostic delays in terms of healthcare costs and mortality. With our data, methods and clinical experts, we will be able to translate our results into future interventions designed to decrease diagnostic delays and improve healthcare outcomes. In addition, while our proposal focuses on infectious diseases, the methods and approaches that we will develop can be adopted to investigate non-infectious diseases and conditions. Project Narrative Diagnostic delays for infectious diseases contribute to worse clinical outcomes, increased healthcare costs and, for some infectious diseases, outbreaks of great public health importance. We will use existing large data sets along with machine-learning techniques and expert clinical guidance to detect patterns of healthcare visits representing diagnostic delays. Our goal is to characterize the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases to inform future interventions.","An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases.",10017203,R01HS027375,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2020,496235,0.07306584783996994
"Bridging Statistical Inference and Mechanistic Network Models for HIV/AIDS Network models are used to investigate the spread of HIV/AIDS, but rather than assuming that the members of a population of interest are fully mixed, the network approach enables individual-level specification of contact patterns by considering the structure of connections among the members of the population. By representing individuals as nodes and contacts between pairs of individuals as edges, this network depiction enables identification of individuals who drive the epidemic, allows for accurate assessment of study power in cluster- randomized trials, and makes it possible to evaluate the impact of interventions on the individuals themselves, their partners, and the broader network. There are currently two major mathematical paradigms to the modeling of networks: the statistical approach and the mechanistic approach. In the statistical approach, one specifies a model that states the likelihood of observing a given network, whereas in the mechanistic approach one specifies a set of domain-specific mechanistic rules at the level of individual nodes, the actors in the network, that are used to evolve the network over time. Given that mechanistic models directly model individual-level behaviors – modification of which is the foundation of most prevention measures – they are a natural fit for infectious diseases. Another attractive feature of mechanistic models is their scalability as they can be implemented for networks consisting of thousands or even millions of nodes, making it possible to simulate population-wide implementation of interventions. Lack of statistical methods for calibrating these models to empirical data has however impeded their use in real-world settings, a limitation that stems from the fact that there are typically no closed-form likelihood functions available for these models due the exponential increase in the number of ways, as a function of network size, of arriving at a given observed network. We propose to overcome this gap by advancing inferential and model selection methods for mechanistic network models, and by developing a framework for investigating their similarities with statistical network models. We base our approach on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), a family of methods developed specifically for settings where likelihood functions are intractable or unavailable. Our specific aims are the following. Aim 1: To develop a statistically principled framework for estimating parameter values and their uncertainty for mechanistic network models. Aim 2: To develop a statistically principled method for model choice between two competing mechanistic network models and estimating the uncertainty surrounding this choice. Aim 3: To establish a framework for mapping mechanistic network models to statistical models. We also propose to implement these methods in open source software, using a combination of Python and C/C++, to facilitate their dissemination and adoption. We believe that the research proposed here can help harness mechanistic network models – and with that leverage some of the insights developed in the network science community over the past decade and more – to help eradicate this disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network models are used to gain a more precise understanding of human behavioral factors associated with the spread of HIV/AIDS in order to develop more effective interventions to halt the epidemic. There are two main mathematical paradigms for modeling networks, the statistical approach and the mechanistic approach, and given that the latter directly models individual-level behaviors – modification of which is the foundation of most prevention measures – mechanistic models are a natural fit for infectious diseases. Lack of statistical methods for calibrating these models to empirical data has so far impeded their use in real-world settings, and we therefore propose to develop parameter inference and model selection methods for mechanistic network models in order to endow the biomedical community with these powerful tools.",Bridging Statistical Inference and Mechanistic Network Models for HIV/AIDS,9970407,R01AI138901,"['AIDS prevention', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Adoption', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Epidemic', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Prevention Measures', 'Prevention strategy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'SET Domain', 'Science', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'effective intervention', 'high dimensionality', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'member', 'network models', 'open source', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'stem', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment strategy']",NIAID,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2020,453846,0.02435529885212349
"Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats SUMMARY: OVERALL  This proposal, Consortium for Immunotherapeutics Against Emerging Viral Diseases, addresses a critical gap in the biodefense portfolio by building an academic-industry partnership to advance effective, fully human, antibody-based immunotherapeutics against three major families of emerging/re-emerging viruses: Lassa virus, Ebola and other Filoviruses, and mosquito-transmitted Alphaviruses that threaten millions worldwide. This program follows directly from our significant body of preliminary data (the largest available for these families of viruses), therapeutics in hand, multidisciplinary expertise, and demonstrated collaborative success. Included in the proposed CETR portfolio are: (1) the only available immunotherapeutics against endemic Lassa virus, with reversal of late-stage disease and complete survival in infected non-human primates, (2) novel Ebola and pan- ebolavirus therapeutics that also completely protect non-human primates from disease, and that were built by the paradigm-shifting and comprehensive analysis of a global consortium, and (3) much needed, first-in-class therapeutics against the re-emerging alphaviruses that have tremendous epidemic potential in the United States and around the globe. These multidisciplinary studies, founded upon pioneering structural biology of the antigen targets, include innovations such as agnostic, high-throughput Fc profiling and optimization, coupled with Fv evolution to enhance potency and developability, as well as a sophisticated statistical and computational analysis core to evaluate thresholds and correlates of protection across the major families of pathogens. Together, we aim to understand what findings represent general rules and what data are specific to each virus family. We also aim to provide streamlined systems for antibody choice and optimization that do not yet exist, and to build a broadly applicable platform for mAb discovery and delivery against any novel pathogen as they emerge. The recent resurgence of Lassa, the epidemic nature of Ebola virus and other re-emerging filoviruses, as well as the major population at risk by global movement of mosquito-borne alphaviruses together demonstrate the tremendous global need for immunotherapeutics developed and advanced by this program. NARRATIVE Three major families of emerging viruses (Lassa and other arenaviruses, Ebola and other filoviruses, and mosquito-borne alphaviruses) threaten human health worldwide, but lack approved therapeutics or vaccines. The proposed multidisciplinary consortium, an academic-industry partnership, will advance safe and effective, fully human, monoclonal antibody therapies against these viruses, using candidate therapies that confer complete protection in non-human primates as our starting point. Our collaborative databases, multivariate analyses and innovative antibody optimization strategies will establish platforms for discovery and delivery of much-needed treatments against these and other infectious diseases.",Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats,9924443,U19AI142790,"['Address', 'Alphavirus', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Arenavirus', 'Arthritogenic', 'Biological Assay', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Disease', 'Ebola', 'Ebola virus', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Filovirus', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Lassa virus', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Monoclonal Antibody Therapy', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primate Diseases', 'Reagent', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'biodefense', 'chikungunya', 'clinical development', 'design', 'experience', 'human monoclonal antibodies', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mosquito-borne', 'multidisciplinary', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'research study', 'structural biology', 'success', 'synergism', 'tool']",NIAID,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,U19,2020,7143424,0.03405424179917225
"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism. Vaccine prevention of even a fraction of these life-threatening diseases could have a significant impact on the health of people around the world.",Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine,9965720,R01AI132117,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Bacteria', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Collection', 'Complement Factor H', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complication', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunity', 'Immunize', 'Immunologics', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'N-terminal', 'Natural Immunity', 'Organism', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Peptide Vaccines', 'Peptide antibodies', 'Peptides', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Recombinant Vaccines', 'Recombinants', 'Rheumatic Heart Disease', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Streptococcal Infections', 'Streptococcal Vaccines', 'Streptococcus pyogenes', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'bactericide', 'base', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'hybrid protein', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'innovation', 'molecular dynamics', 'multiple myeloma M Protein', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peptide structure', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein structure', 'retinal S antigen peptide M', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine evaluation']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2020,741796,0.026320670870572677
"Developing a robust platform to identify unexpected and novel viruses in human brain tissue Project Summary / Abstract  Central nervous system infections with RNA viruses cause severe neurological deficits and death, and are extremely challenging to diagnose. This multiple PI proposal presents an innovative research program that will provide the foundation for a comprehensive viral diagnostics pipeline to rapidly diagnose RNA virus infections from surgical brain biopsies. The investigators will combine two cutting-edge techniques for viral detection, screening with double-stranded RNA immunohistochemistry (dsRNA IHC) to identify cases with a high likelihood of a viral etiology, and unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for specific virus identification and genome analysis.  To develop the dsRNA IHC screening assay, six commercially available anti-dsRNA antibodies will be optimized in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brain tissue and evaluated in a series of known infectious and non-infectious cases. The top candidates will be tested in a set of brain biopsies with inflammation of unclear etiology and compared to results of mNGS performed in parallel. The development of this assay will facilitate efficient screening of FFPE tissue samples from patients with neurological disease of unclear pathogenesis to identify those with a high likelihood of viral etiology. To improve mNGS methods for FFPE brain tissue, new laboratory techniques will be tested to increase the yield and quality of viral RNA extracted. In addition to virus identification, mNGS will be used to perform full-genome deep sequencing of viruses. These results can be applied to molecular epidemiology, disease surveillance, and understanding pathogen-host interactions. Overall, this project will enhance our understanding of RNA viruses that cause CNS infection, inform future studies of virus evolution and pathogenesis, and lay the foundation for the development of a comprehensive viral diagnostics pipeline that will substantially improve the care of patients with devastating CNS infections. This work aligns very well with the NINDS mission to seek and apply fundamental knowledge of the brain to reduce the burden of neurological disease.  This R21 Exploratory Neuroscience Research Grant proposal will support and expand the collaboration between the two PIs. The unique combination of expertise in neuropathology, infectious disease pathology, virology, clinical infectious disease, and metagenomic sequencing demonstrate the requisite skills and perspective needed to achieve the goals of this proposal. The stimulating environments of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard University, and Emory University are extremely well suited to the proposed research plan, which not only provide critical equipment and facilities infrastructure, but also mentorship, formal opportunities to present and discuss results, and eventual venues to implement this clinical testing prospectively. Project Narrative Viral infections of the central nervous system cause significant illness and death, and in many patients the specific virus causing infection is never found. This project will develop new tools to detect viruses in brain tissue, including previously unknown viruses, and sequence their genomes. The objectives of this project are to improve diagnostics for patients with devastating neurological illness, and to open new research directions in studying viruses that cause central nervous system infection.",Developing a robust platform to identify unexpected and novel viruses in human brain tissue,10105533,R21NS119660,"['Adenoviruses', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Applications Grants', 'Arboviruses', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Case Study', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Central Nervous System Viral Diseases', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Cytoplasmic Inclusion', 'DNA Viruses', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Double-Stranded RNA', 'Encephalitis', 'Enterovirus', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Herpesviridae', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Target', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neurologic Symptoms', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Nodule', 'Nuclear Inclusion', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Virus Infections', 'RNA Viruses', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Shotgun Sequencing', 'Specimen', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Woman', 'Work', 'assay development', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'deep sequencing', 'fungus', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'innovation', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuropathology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel virus', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'prospective test', 'rRNA Genes', 'rapid diagnosis', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'viral RNA', 'viral detection', 'viral genomics', 'virology', 'virus identification', 'whole genome']",NINDS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,480375,0.003586845623575794
"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist. Our long-term objective is to apply enhanced understanding of adaptive immunity to accelerate the rational development of new vaccines and therapeutics.",Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression,9996359,DP5OD023118,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody titer measurement', 'B cell repertoire', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Convalescence', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cryopreservation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'EBV-associated disease', 'Ensure', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Herpesviridae', 'Herpesviridae Infections', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Human', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Mononucleosis', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nasopharynx Carcinoma', 'Oncogenic', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Primary Infection', 'Public Health', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell', 'Recovery', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Stomach Carcinoma', 'Symptoms', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'adaptive immune response', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder control', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'immune function', 'insight', 'lead candidate', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'neutralizing monoclonal antibodies', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'novel vaccines', 'pathogen', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'treatment strategy', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine trial', 'virology', 'young adult']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,DP5,2020,363296,0.03672019701959523
"Gut Microbial and Metabolic Mediators of Rotavirus Vaccine Response Abstract Rotavirus (RV) infection causes life-threatening, dehydrating diarrhea and is the leading cause of diarrheal deaths among children <5 years old despite availability of a vaccine. Critically, the oral vaccine is less effective in middle- and low-income countries where disproportionately more deaths occur compared to high-income countries. Addressing this disparity in vaccine effectiveness is a major public health priority. Correlates of protection do not exist, and cellular responses against RV in humans remain incompletely understood. Mounting evidence supports a direct role for the gut microbiota in modulating humoral and cellular immune responses to oral vaccines, but little is known about their actual mechanism of action. In our pilot study, vaccine responders had a significantly greater abundance of Bifidobacterium longum and higher content of microbial genes associated with folate transformation in their gut compared to nonresponders. These data suggest that infants may depend on microbes such as B. longum to synthesize folate de novo as a mechanism for RV-specific immune cell expansion. We hypothesize that de novo folate synthesis by microbes such as B. longum facilitates RV-specific immune cell expansion, and that levels of folate modulate vaccine immunogenicity. We propose to study 330 infants from the US, Panama, and Peru where vaccine efficacy is known to be high, medium and low, respectively, by using both stored and prospectively collected longitudinal samples of blood and stool from infants 0 to 12 months of age. We have designed a novel RV “megapool” of immunogenic peptides to define cellular immune responses to RV vaccination in addition to assessing traditional serum RV-specific IgA and stool RV shedding after immunization (Aim 1). We will characterize gut microbial composition and function using metagenomic sequencing at multiple pre-vaccination time points in vaccine responders and nonresponders to determine if the abundance of B. longum and capacity to synthesize folate predict vaccine immunogenicity (Aim 2). We will analyze the metabolic byproducts to identify if folate or other metabolites enhance vaccine response (Aim 3). Our unique team of experts in vaccinology, immunology, microbiology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics will ensure successful integrative analysis and interpretation of these immunologic and multi-omics data. Completion of the study will provide a comprehensive characterization of microbial and metabolic biomarkers of RV vaccine responses, paving the way for targeted immune augmentation strategies. Project Narrative Rotavirus vaccine was developed to prevent severe diarrhea and is especially important in low- and middle- income countries where 85% of deaths due to rotaviruses occur; unfortunately, vaccine efficacy is lower in these countries compared to high-income countries. This proposal will study infants from three countries with different socioeconomic levels and use sophisticated methods to determine how specific bacteria in the infant gut (microbiome) may change the response to the vaccine. If successful, this study will have a significant impact on this important public health disparity as a targeted intervention to improve vaccine response, even if small, could save tens of thousands of lives every year.",Gut Microbial and Metabolic Mediators of Rotavirus Vaccine Response,9862588,R01HD100542,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Age-Months', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody titer measurement', 'Bacteria', 'Bifidobacterium', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Country', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diarrhea', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Feces', 'Folic Acid', 'Folic Acid Deficiency', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Biotransformation', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nutrient', 'Oral', 'Panama', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Peru', 'Peruvian', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Role', 'Rotavirus', 'Rotavirus Infections', 'Rotavirus Vaccines', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Cell Proliferation', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Vitamins', 'base', 'cell growth', 'design', 'folic acid supplementation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'health disparity', 'immune function', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'infant gut microbiome', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'oral vaccine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health priorities', 'response', 'sample collection', 'socioeconomics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'stool sample', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccinology']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,681780,0.05152978912178172
