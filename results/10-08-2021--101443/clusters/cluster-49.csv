"Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease Project Summary Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent in the U.S. population and is a major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease morbidity, and mortality. Current gaps exist in characterizing the heterogeneity of CKD population. Obesity further increases the risks of adverse outcomes among people with impaired kidney function. However, the mechanism between obesity and CKD is not fully understood, and numerous studies have observed “obesity paradox” or survival advantage being associated with higher body fat among advanced CKD patients. In this context, the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study provides an ideal opportunity to study the mechanism of CKD with its rich clinical information and population characteristics, as well as its availability of non-targeted high-dimensional metabolomics data. To better understand the “adiposity-obesity-related” (AOR) mechanisms of CKD and to discover novel biomarkers, we propose to identify distinct subgroups based on AOR attributes and to perform metabolomics analysis on the identified subgroups and CKD outcomes. The overall goal of this research and the training plan is to execute three studies as the subjects of a doctoral dissertation in metabolomics analysis and CKD epidemiology. First, in Aim 1, we will identify latent AOR subgroups in the CRIC CKD population using the data-driven approach of consensus clustering. We will also evaluate the utility and the independent risk discrimination performance of the AOR subgroups with key CKD outcomes (CKD progression, CVD, and death), using Cox regression model with adjustment for known CKD risk factors. Next, in Aim 2, we will perform metabolomics analysis and identify metabolites and metabolomic patterns that are associated with the different AOR subgroups. In response to the statistical challenges in analyzing the high-dimensional metabolomics data, we will implement both the machine learning random-forest algorithm and the conventional univariate and multivariate regression analysis. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the relationship between CKD outcomes and the metabolites and metabolomic patterns identified in Aim 2, using Cox regression model, extended by pathway analysis and mediation analysis. Mining high-dimensional metabolomics data with AOR phenotypes in the CRIC Study holds promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD. Future studies can be built upon these findings to improve more effective and personalized CKD management in the setting of the obesity epidemic. A rigorous curriculum including didactic and experiential learning in biomedical data mining, statistics, and advanced epidemiology will round out the applicant's training, preparing her to be an independent and collaborative investigator and a kidney disease epidemiologist at the completion of his PhD. Project Narrative Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its risk factors of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are prevalent in the United States. To better understand the mechanism between adiposity-obesity-related CKD mechanism, the proposed research will implement machine learning algorithms, and identify distinct patient subgroups and discover novel CKD biomarkers, using the clinical and high-dimensional metabolomics data from a diverse cohort of CKD patients. The findings of our study hold promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD, and facilitate personalized disease management.",Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease,9834239,F31DK122683,"['Active Learning', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body fat', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Curriculum', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Kynurenine', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome Assessment', 'PTH gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Troponin T', 'Tryptophan', 'United States', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'patient subsets', 'personalized management', 'population based', 'preservation', 'random forest', 'response', 'statistics', 'targeted biomarker', 'tool']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2019,45016,0.08517297350431277
"Artificial intelligence-enabled, real-time communication software for optimizing clinical decision making during the allocation, procurement, and transplantation of donated organs Project Abstract for HealthTech Solutions Kidney transplantation is a clinically effective and cost-effective treatment for patients suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and diabetes. Twenty-two patients die each day waiting for a transplant and 30% of all deaths in the US could be prevented by organ transplant. Despite the obvious clinical and cost-effective advantages of kidney transplantation, there has been a decades-long rise in the kidney discard rate from 5.1% in 1988 to 19.2% in 2015. During a successful Phase I grant and to address the need for a dedicated communications system to help improve transplant patient outcomes and achieve greater donated organ utilization, HealthTech Solutions (HTS), Inc. developed a proprietary mobile application for secure team communication tailored specifically for kidney transplant teams. To further improve communication efficiency and augment critical decision making in healthcare, specifically for surgeons, HTS will employ machine learning (ML) powered clinical decision support. Clinical decision support (CDS) may significantly increase access, increase quality, and reduce the cost of kidney transplantation. The proposed project is designed to further test and quantify the improvement of the donor management, coordination process, and kidney utilization outcomes using the company’s CDS and communication infrastructure for medical team communication. The aims are; 1) Develop CDS models specifically for transplant professionals aimed at improving decision times and decision confidence. Develop the CDS infrastructure capable of handling medical data and serving insights safely, securely, and rapidly; 2) Asses usability by working with a test group to exceed usability criteria and ensure that CDS meets clinician needs through user feedback iterations. Verification of utility from a diversified testing group (n=10) that represent every type of professional involved in transplant cases. 3) Measure the effects of TXP Chat enhanced with CDS after live clinical implementation in the kidney offer and procurement processes for more than 3,000 offers (1,500 with CDS and 1,500 control) over a period of 365 days with multiple partner institutions (n=3). TXP Chat and CDS will demonstrate to be reliable, secure, trustworthy and useful by the clinical/technical community, increase kidney acceptance practices resulting in an increase in kidney transplants, reduction in cold ischemic time, and reduction in time from offer to transplant. Ultimately, these metrics have been demonstrated in the literature to improve patient outcomes, reduce expensive chronic treatment costs (e.g. dialysis), reduce patient deaths from lack of kidney availability, and significantly improve human health and productivity. Study results will be disseminated via publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Aim 1 will lay the foundation for further development to enable wider CDS in the Phase IIB. Aim 2 will prove physician support and steady adoption trend as we roll into commercialization. Aim 3 will provide multi-center pilot study data used to prove increased efficiency of the process in terms of time, money, and total number of kidneys transplanted. Project Narrative Despite the obvious clinical and cost-effectiveness advantages of kidney transplantation for many patients, nearly 1 in 5 kidneys authorized for donation are discarded. This project addresses the need for an efficient communications software technology enhanced with clinical decision support tailored for organ procurement organizations and transplant centers. Combined with enhanced communication efficiency, clinical decision support powered by machine learning may significantly improve donated kidney utilization and increase the number of viable, but currently unused organs that could otherwise be successfully transplanted, reducing waste and saving lives.","Artificial intelligence-enabled, real-time communication software for optimizing clinical decision making during the allocation, procurement, and transplantation of donated organs",9845904,R44LM012575,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asses', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Direct Costs', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Journals', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Multiple Partners', 'Organ', 'Organ Procurements', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Renal Glycosuria', 'Reporting', 'Savings', 'Secure', 'Surgeon', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Transplanted tissue', 'Treatment Cost', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'burnout', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical implementation', 'cohesion', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'mobile application', 'operation', 'prevent', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'transmission process', 'transplant centers', 'trend', 'usability', 'wasting']",NLM,ORGANIZER,R44,2019,512863,0.17136999959668633
"2019 STONE LAB SCIENTIFIC SYMPOSIUM: THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX FOR KIDNEY STONE DISEASE 2019 STONE LAB SCIENTIFIC SYMPOSIUM: THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX FOR KIDNEY STONE DISEASE  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A 1.5-day symposium, StoneLab will be held December 6-7, 2019 at AUA Headquarters in Linthicum, Maryland, near BWI Airport. The novel StoneLab Symposium will be a meeting where kidney stone researchers can come together with experts in biomedical engineering, physics, chemistry, artificial intelligence, medical device design and development. We plan to encourage researchers to “think outside the box” in the search for advances in kidney stone treatment. The target audience for this meeting includes: urologists, nephrologists, basic scientists, early-career investigators, residents, research fellows, and project management members of urology research teams in the area of nephrolithiasis and related technology development. It is essential that the urology community, and especially trainees, early-career physician- scientists, and researchers be provided with accessible opportunities to gain understanding of new knowledge and recent advances in not only their own fields, but in related fields that they may not otherwise be aware of, and leverage this for new research frameworks that can help improve the treatment of kidney stone disease. A critical aspect of the StoneLab Sympoisum is the delivery of talks from outside the normal realm of kidney stone research by leading basic scientists, followed by discussions led by kidney stone researchers and surgeons. The intent of these discussions is to spur the development of collaborations and the generation of new ideas and avenues for exploration. Another goal of the meeting is to help identify future funding needs and growth areas for kidney stone research. The R13 support requested in this application will encourage early investigators to participate in the workshop and stimulate their development as researchers and surgeon- scientists. This symposium will have a major impact by bringing together premier kidney stone researchers, along with experts in nephrology, biomedical engineering, physics, chemistry, artificial intelligence, and medical device design and development, to explore solutions for the most pressing translational science issues facing kidney stone researchers today. The Principal Investigator (PI), Carolyn J.M. Best, PhD, is AUA Director of Research.

"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9695208,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'kidney dysfunction', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'predictive test', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'random forest', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,335803,0.17768670997852193
"A new approach to predict graft outcome from histology in children undergoing kidney transplantation using machine learning methods Abstract Although the overall renal graft survival has dramatically improved over the last several decades, almost half of pediatric patients lose their transplant within 10 years. Epidemiology, immunology and histology are all key elements in understanding post-transplant complications and in predicting clinical outcomes, however accurate prediction of transplant outcomes remains challenging and understudied among pediatric kidney transplant recipients. Machine learning technology is rapidly advancing and has demonstrated remarkable predictive accuracy surpassing classical predictive models in several biomedical applications. The goal of this research proposal is to develop machine learning methods to improve prediction of transplant outcomes through analysis of histology, assemble data sufficient to describe the incidence of different types of rejection and histological findings on pediatric kidney transplant biopsies, and to assess their impact on graft outcome. To achieve these goals, we will assemble an international multicenter cohort of over 700 pediatric kidney transplant recipients and develop and validate machine-learning models combining clinical, immunological and histological data for predicting short-term pediatric graft outcomes. This study will enable accurate, reproducible, and standardized assessment of histopathological findings in pediatric transplant recipients and provide a new method to predict graft outcome. This will pave the way to future large, prospective study assessing the feasibility and potential impact of machine-learning methods in transplant biopsy analysis, with the goal of improving clinical management and resource utilization by identifying patients with high risk of graft loss. Finally, this study will provide critical information for efficient and effective design of clinical trials focused on improving outcomes of pediatric kidney transplant recipients, with an emphasis on individualized treatment. Project Narrative: Accurate prediction of graft outcome in pediatric kidney transplant patients is critical to individualize patients' management and treatment and to design efficient and effective clinical trials focused on improving outcomes of these patients. Our long-term goal is to improve the assessment of histopathological findings in pediatric transplant recipients and create a new systematic methodology to predict graft outcomes that can be applied nationally and internationally. The goal of this research proposal is to develop machine learning methods to improve prediction of transplant outcomes through analysis of histology, assemble data sufficient to describe the incidence of different types of rejection and histological findings on pediatric kidney transplant biopsies, and to assess their impact on graft outcome.",A new approach to predict graft outcome from histology in children undergoing kidney transplantation using machine learning methods,9808911,R21DK122229,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemiology', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft Survival', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Update', 'allograft rejection', 'base', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'digital', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized management', 'post-transplant', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'repository', 'risk benefit ratio', 'transplant centers', 'transplantation medicine']",NIDDK,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,269258,0.10154044305301263
"Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival  Chronic kidney disease affects about 10% of adults in the United States and 7-12% of the population worldwide. It may lead to irreversible loss of kidney function, known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For patients with ESRD, kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment compared to dialysis in terms of patient survival, quality of life and cost. Despite the advantages of kidney transplants, most patients with ESRD are treated with dialysis primarily because there exist an insufficient number of compatible donors for patients. The human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) of the organ donor and recipient are known to be a significant contributing factor to transplanted organ survival times due to immunogenicity, the immune response of the recipient to the transplanted organ. Mismatches between donor and recipient HLAs are associated with shorter survival times; however, it is extremely rare to identify donors that have a perfect match with recipients, so most transplants involve mismatched HLAs. Our main objective is to accurately predict survival times for kidney transplants by incorporating both data- driven models of HLA compatibility based on outcomes of past transplants and biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity. Accurate prediction of survival times can improve patient transplant outcomes by enabling more efficient allocation of donors and recipients, particularly by reducing the number of repeat transplants due to graft failure with a poorly matched donor. We propose to estimate HLA compatibilities using high-dimensional variable selection techniques applied to outcomes of past transplants and through a novel donor-recipient latent space model for the HLA compatibility network. We then propose to incorporate these predicted compatibilities along with biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity using amino acid sequences and epitopes into a multi-task classification-based survival prediction algorithm. Our proposed approach for learning integrated data- and biologically-driven models of transplant survival generalizes broadly to organ transplantation (liver, heart, pancreas, lungs) and possibly to bone marrow transplantation. Finding better methods for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and recipient may redefine and improve clinical outcomes for organ and tissue transplants. In fact, new approach may revolutionize the selection of donors with recipients, thereby producing significantly improved long-term organ and tissue transplant survivals.",Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival ,9916110,R01LM013311,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens', 'Anus', 'Biological', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Donor Selection', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epitopes', 'HLA Antigens', 'Heart', 'Immune response', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ Donor', 'Organ Survival', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Science', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Transplanted tissue', 'United States', 'base', 'cost', 'discrete time', 'graft failure', 'hazard', 'high dimensionality', 'human model', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'learning network', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'survival prediction', 'transplant model']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO,R01,2019,274577,0.13058617321576746
"In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones OVERALL SUMMARY  The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and inefficient emergency department visits that typically include repetitive exposure to ionizing radiation from diagnostic imaging, and will significantly reduce the often lengthy (days to weeks) wait time patients must endure before procedures for stone removal can be scheduled and performed. As the proposed therapy system is entirely noninvasive, patients will be treated on an outpatient basis. Further, as the system is designed to efficiently and painlessly break stones of any size and expel the fragments from the kidney, the treatment of both symptomatic and asymptomatic stones using this technology will reduce the high retreatment and stone event recurrence rates associated with current surgical interventions for stone removal.  In this effort, we will combine stone breakage by burst wave lithotripsy (BWL), clearance of fragments by ultrasonic propulsion (UP), and stone-specific ultrasound imaging (S-mode) into an integrated system in which exposure strategies are adapted during treatment in response to real-time acoustic feedback to enhance comminution efficiency and patient safety. We will tailor treatment by investigating numerically and in lab tests the primary mechanisms - cavitation and elastic waves - involved in the comminution process over a broad parameter space. We will develop acoustics-based feedback including model- based, machine learning and passive acoustic mapping (PAM) of the bubble field to signal the need to adjust the energy output. We will investigate the morphological and functional response of the kidney in living animals and in ex vivo perfused porcine kidneys, and pursue tissue protective treatment strategies such as power ramping.  These studies will include the first in-human test of BWL in which we will compare the comminution effectiveness and safety of treatment with and without adaptive output control in response to acoustic feedback. In addition, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of the benefits and risks of fragmenting and expelling symptomatic and asymptomatic stones in the clinic. Toward application of the system for use in humans, we will refine and validate the use of UP and S-mode together to improve stone and fragment detection. With our eye on the future of stone management, we will develop and validate in vivo an extracorporeal acoustic tractor beam to grasp and carry fragments through the complex three- dimensional path of the urinary space and out of the kidney. OVERALL NARRATIVE Urinary stone disease, which affects 1 in 11 Americans, is one of the most painful diseases and also the costliest non-malignant urologic disease, because current management is limited to observation for the stone to pass or performing surgery. The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based, handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and temporizing emergency department visits and radiation exposing imaging while the patient waits in pain for days to weeks for the stone to pass or be surgically removed.","In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones",9791705,P01DK043881,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Bowman&apos', 's space', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lithotripsy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Non-Malignant', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Painless', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Publications', 'Radiation exposure', 'Ramp', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Tissue', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retreatment', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Wait Time', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'calcification', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'grasp', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individualized medicine', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'response', 'safety study', 'simulation', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P01,2019,1619137,0.06956834059916343
"Single Cell Analysis of Kidney Transplant Antibody Mediated Rejection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Kidney transplantation offers the greatest survival advantage to patients with end stage kidney disease and is vastly more cost effective than dialysis. Long-term survival of kidney transplants has not improved in recent decades. Antibody mediated rejection (AMR) has been identified as a major cause of transplant failure. Currently, management of patients with AMR is inconsistent among centers and frequently fails. We hypothesize that the cell types and cell states unique to AMR can be resolved by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of biopsy samples taken from patients at the time of diagnosis. This approach uses an unsupervised framework for dissecting transcriptional heterogeneity within complex tissues such as the kidney. This allows for the interrogation of cell states and subpopulations using an unbiased clustering approach that is independent of previous knowledge and can provide unprecedented resolution. To test our hypothesis we propose the following aims: In Aim 1, we will perform scRNA-seq of 40 research biopsy cores (20 AMR and 20 non-AMR). From this data we will identify genes expressed in endothelial cells and antibody secreting cells that define AMR specific phenotypes. We have demonstrated feasibility of this approach by generating single cell data from human biopsy samples as outlined in the research plan. For Aim 2, we will use immunohistochemistry to validate these AMR specific markers on a set of independent tissue samples. For Aim 3, we will use publicly available Affymetrix microarray datasets from kidney transplant biopsies with associated outcomes data to determine which cell types are associated with allograft outcome. This proposal logically builds on the principal investigator’s previous research experience and clinical training. To date he has been working full time in clinical transplantation and continuing his research endeavors on an ‘out of hours’ basis. Despite this his research output and experience continue to grow and he has recently published a report on the first successful application of this technology to human kidney biopsy tissue (co-first author). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills by attaining additional knowledge and practical research experience in single cell methods, bioinformatics and immunology. The career development goals will be achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentoring by Dr. Benjamin Humphreys and an advisory committee consisting of Drs. Barbara Murphy (transplant genomics), Phil Payne (biomedical informatics and translational science), Rob Mitra (single cell applications) and Paul Allen (translational immunology), didactic coursework, scientific investigation, and training in scientific communication and research ethics. This work will take place in Washington University which has a rich history of mentoring successful physician-scientists. Successful completion of this career development award will result in a better understanding of AMR, result in the principal investigator’s transition to an independent physician- scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for RO1-level funding.

The pathophysiology of antibody mediated rejection is poorly understood and current treatment strategies frequently fail.

"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantification is crucial for clinical management of these children.

"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules. In this proposal we will perform high-content, high throughput screening for kidney regeneration in zebrafish to discover novel chemical probes to investigate mechanisms of augmented kidney regeneration after injury.",High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs,9613245,R01DK112652,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Breeding', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fibrosis', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Microsomes', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Organogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Prodrugs', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Renal tubule structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tubular formation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'kidney repair', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'organ growth', 'organ regeneration', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,352125,0.19461846486670495
"Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States over 500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in ~20% of cardiac surgical patients. Several cohort and registry studies have reported that AKI defined by rise in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery associates with development of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events. However, it is unclear which patients will develop long-term adverse kidney events, adverse cardiovascular events, or both. In recent years blood and urine AKI biomarkers have been identified that reflect different aspects of AKI biology and that detect serum creatinine defined AKI earlier than rise in serum creatinine or detect subclinical AKI that is not revealed by traditional serum creatinine assessment. Clinical outcomes and biomarker research has focused mainly on detecting cardiac surgery- associated AKI itself, but not on predicting which patients are at greatest risk for long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after AKI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that perioperative blood and urine AKI biomarkers significantly associate with increased long-term (2 to 5 years) postoperative major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). MAKE is defined as the composite of dialysis, death, renal hospitalization, or ≥ 30 day postoperative eGFR decline >25% from preoperative baseline. MACE is defined as the composite of death or hospitalizations for heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, arrhythmia, or stroke. We propose a prospective observational cohort study of 610 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years following cardiac surgery. Based on preliminary data we will assess plasma NT-pro- B-type natriuretic peptide, plasma intact fibroblast growth factor 23, serum cystatin C, urine TIMP-2*IGFBP7, and urine Kidney Injury Molecule-1 AKI biomarkers preoperatively and at 5 postoperative time points. This proposal will address three specific aims: 1) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MAKE during long-term follow-up; 2) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MACE during long-term follow-up; and 3) To develop clinical prediction models for long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. In addition to traditional regression modeling, we will use machine learning that leverages detailed perioperative data including time-varying intraoperative and intensive care unit clinical data and blood and urine AKI biomarker data to create high performing prediction models. Our proposal is significant because knowing what blood and urine AKI biomarkers and clinical parameters accurately predict long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after cardiac surgery provides the foundation for clinical trials that will identify effective short and long-term interventions for patients at highest risk. Our proposal is innovative because clinical and biomarker data has not been leveraged in this way to predict long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because combining blood and urine acute kidney injury biomarkers and clinical data to identify cardiac surgical patients at highest risk for long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes will allow interventional studies to better individualize clinical management to prevent these outcomes. While acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is associated with increased long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (~25% incidence), it remains unclear which patients with postoperative acute kidney injury are at highest risk. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that can be applied to enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing illness and disability.",Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery,9800334,R01HL148448,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Anesthesiology', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Applications Grants', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain natriuretic peptide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Science', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Foxes', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nephrology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasma', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Transfusion', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'health record', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'post gamma-globulins', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rat KIM-1 protein']",NHLBI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,802772,0.1105766817456193
"Quantitative Renal Imaging for Kidney Diseases Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography (CEMRA) with gadolinium (Gd) provides high resolution visualization of the vascular compartment, but is rarely used in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73m2) due to the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). There is thus an unmet need to develop MRI techniques that can both replace Gd and provide new insights into the etiology and severity of CKD.  PI Sridhar and his team at Northeastern University (NEU) have developed a new technique, Quantitative Ultra-short Time-to-Echo Contrast-Enhanced (QUTE-CE) MRI, leads to quantifiable positive contrast images of the vasculature with unprecedented clarity and definition. QUTE-CE is particularly optimal using Ferumoxytol (Feraheme), an FDA approved iron-oxide nanopharmaceutical, that is already routinely used for iron-deficient anemia therapy in CKD patients. Under an ongoing clinical trial (NCT03266848) we have demonstrated QUTE- CE MRI for renal and cerebral imaging in humans at 3T.  This R21 project will develop the QUTE-CE MRI method for kidney imaging in patients with both normal kidney function as well as with CKD. We propose to scan 25 total patients (10 in Year 1 and 15 in Year 2) who are already scheduled to receive ferumoxytol infusion for iron-deficiency anemia therapy. The specific aims of this project are summarized below. Specific Aim 1: Renal Vascular Angiograms of CKD Patients. These studies will be conducted at NEU and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) using Siemens Prisma MRI scanners. Three tasks will be pursued to develop the optimizing protocol. Task 1: Develop a robust QUTE-CE imaging protocol. Task 2: Implement a robust methodology for accounting for B1 inhomogeneity. Task 3: Develop a robust trajectory for improved image reconstruction including motion correction. We hypothesize that QUTE-CE MRI will lead to high resolution angiograms that will allow for the safe diagnosis of existing pathologies such as renal artery stenosis in addition to the novel identification of kidney micro-vascular disease. Specific Aim 2: Obtain quantitative renal blood volume (RBV) maps and develop machine learning algorithms (MLA) to better understand the severity of kidney disease. The renal angiograms will be analyzed to obtain renal blood volume (RBV) maps. The RBV maps will be analyzed in terms of Machine-Learning algorithms (MLA) to explore whether we can identify common etiologies of CKD as well as estimate the severity of kidney disease. The MLA will enable organ segmentation, automatized renal parenchyma volumetry, as well as automated extraction and labeling of lesions. The MLA results will be compared with radiological scoring, estimated GFR, and degree of albuminuria. We hypothesize that the absolute RBV maps will enable quantitative monitoring of blood volume in cortex and medulla, and that RBV could be a surrogate parameter for renal microvascular rarefaction, a central mechanism in CKD initiation and progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE TITLE: Quantitative Renal Imaging for Kidney Disease This project will develop a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging technique QUTE-CE MRI for studies of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The QUTE-CE MRI methodology provides very clear and high resolution angiographic images of vasculature using a safe and clinically approved nanoparticle contrast agent, that will transform standard of care by enabling diagnostic imaging for a large population of patients with CKD who cannot be imaged with the current gadolinium contrast agent due to its toxicity.",Quantitative Renal Imaging for Kidney Diseases,9824779,R21DK118449,"['Accounting', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Angiography', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Cyst', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Etiology', 'FDA approved', 'Gadolinium', 'Gaussian model', 'General Hospitals', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infusion procedures', 'Iodine', 'Iron', 'Iron deficiency anemia', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic nanoparticles', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis\xa0', 'Nephrology', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Proteinuria', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Toxicity', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal Artery Stenosis', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Severities', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Veins', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'clinical imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'expectation', 'ferumoxytol', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'iron oxide', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney imaging', 'kidney vascular structure', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanodrug', 'nanoparticle', 'novel', 'nuclear imaging', 'patient population', 'prisma', 'prognostic', 'standard of care']",NIDDK,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,220889,0.12570653430561937
"Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups ABSTRACT Although patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) present with shared clinical signs and symptoms (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema), there is dramatic variability in prognosis and response to therapy, frustrating patients, families and their clinicians. Even within the histopathologic categories used in the current diagnostic approach (e.g. minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), there is dramatic variability in disease progression and response to therapy, highlighting the underlying biological heterogeneity within the groups. Small studies with broad, clinical patient inclusion criteria have demonstrated that a subset of patients respond well to anti-TNF therapy, but accurate pre-treatment response of those individuals is not possible based on routine clinical parameters. This project will leverage the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort study, a multi-center prospective study of 600 patients with FSGS, MCD and MN with rich clinical data, kidney biopsy tissue and gene expression profiles. This study will leverage the kidney tissue gene expression data to identify a subgroup of patients with TNF-alpha pathway activation, assess associated clinical outcomes and identify non- molecular predictors of the subgroup. The aims are:  Aim 1: To identify a subgroup of Nephrotic Syndrome patients with homogeneous activation of the  TNF-alpha transcriptional pathway.  Aim 2: To compare molecular subgroups with conventional clinical-pathologic classification in  clinical outcome prediction.  Aim 3: To identify non-invasive markers (e.g. demographics, blood and urine markers), standard  pathology features and novel pathologic biopsy descriptors associated with the TNF-alpha subgroup. To accomplish this project, the applicant will pursue formal training in systems biology, genetic epidemiology and bioinformatics. She will be mentored by a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in systems biology, epidemiology and bioinformatics. The long term objective is to improve the clinical care of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome by improved understanding of the underlying biology, identifying novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for future validation in animal models and mechanistic-based interventional clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nephrotic Syndrome, caused by several rare kidney diseases, is characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, swelling and kidney failure. Patients affected by the syndrome suffer complications of the disease as well as the toxicity of the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat it, but their individual presentations, response to treatment and prognosis can vary markedly. This project aims to use gene expression levels from kidney biopsy tissue to identify the subgroup patients most likely to respond to TNF- alpha blocking medications, an approach which, if validated, may help to inform targeted therapy selections for these patients.",Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups,9672412,K08DK115891,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Edema', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Membranous Glomerulonephritis', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Publications', 'Renal glomerular disease', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Swelling', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'biological systems', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'kidney biopsy', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'predict clinical outcome', 'response', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2019,169110,0.11558879526888444
"Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus Abstract Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current clinical laboratory markers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to optimize individual patient care creating a need to develop novel biomarkers for LN. To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,9703894,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2019,642740,0.07582722302831157
"Anatomic biomarkers of chronic kidney disease progression among children Progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in childhood is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic bone disease, and death. Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), including posterior urethral valves, account for 50-60% of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children and are the most common cause of ESRD in this age group. In children with CAKUT, kidney injury is often already established at birth due to renal dysplasia. Some children, however, maintain preserved kidney function into adulthood while others progress to ESRD in childhood. Our ability to effectively implement therapies to slow CKD progression is limited by our lack of understanding of which patients are at greatest risk for CKD progression and therefore would be most likely to benefit from early intervention. Thus there is a need for biomarkers that can identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression. To identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression, we will develop novel computational methods to derive clinically informative biomarkers from ultrasound (US) imaging data using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and effectively integrate them with established clinical measures for early prediction of CKD progression. To achieve reliable and accurate kidney segmentation, Aim 1 develops an automatic kidney segmentation method by adopting fully CNNs, conditional random fields, and active contour models to simultaneously learn informative high-level image features and inter-voxel relationship under shape regularizations to improve the segmentation accuracy and robustness to imaging noise. To achieve improved prediction of CDK progression based on US imaging data, deep CNNs will be adopted to learn informative imaging features in a multi-instance learning framework to predict which children with CAKUT will develop CKD progression and their timing of progression in Aim 2. These techniques will be applied to a dataset of patients followed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, in order to derive individualized predictive indices of CKD progression. The proposed new techniques will allow us to early differentiate patients with distinct disease progression patterns. Fully automatic kidney ultrasound image segmentation and quantification methods will be developed using deep convolutional neural networks for early predicting chronic kidney disease progression",Anatomic biomarkers of chronic kidney disease progression among children,9669438,R21DK117297,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Bladder', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Progression', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'End stage renal failure', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Bone Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Proteinuria', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urethra', 'Urinary tract', 'Urodynamics', 'age group', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'boys', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'kidney preservation', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized predictions', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'secondary analysis']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,262171,0.13914800292783866
"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career.

"A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT More people die every year from kidney disease than breast or prostate cancer. Kidney transplantation is life-saving but is limited by a shortage of organ donors and an unacceptably high donor organ discard rate. The decision to use or discard a donor kidney relies heavily on manual quantitation of key microscopic findings by pathologists. A major limitation of this microscopic examination is human variability and inefficiency in interpreting the findings, resulting in potentially healthy organs being deemed unsuitable for transplantation or potentially damaged organs being transplanted inappropriately. Our team developed the first Deep Learning model capable of automatically quantifying percent global glomerulosclerosis in whole slide images of donor kidney frozen section wedge biopsies. This innovative approach has the potential to transform donor kidney biopsy evaluation by improving pathologist efficiency, accuracy, and precision ultimately resulting in optimized donor organ utilization, diminished health care costs, and improved patient outcomes. The goal of this project is to establish our Deep Learning automated quantitative evaluation as the standard practice of donor kidney evaluation prior to transplantation. This will be achieved by assembling a team of expert kidney pathologists and computer scientists specializing in machine learning. The proposal will evaluate the accuracy and precision of the computerized approach to quantifying percent global glomerulosclerosis and compare these results with current standard of care pathologist evaluation. The feasibility of deploying the Deep Learning model to analyze whole slide images on the cloud will also be examined. The end product of this STTR will be a web-based platform to securely deploy Deep Learning image analysis as a tool to assist pathologists with donor kidney biopsy evaluation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Before a kidney can be transplanted, the tissue must be assessed under a microscope to ensure the organ is healthy enough for transplant. A major limitation of microscopic examination is human variability in interpreting the findings, resulting in healthy organs being deemed unsuitable for transplantation. This funding will support developing computer algorithms to assist pathologists in microscopic examination of donor kidney tissues, resulting in more consistent and objective biopsy interpretations, minimizing discard of potentially usable kidneys and optimizing organ placement for transplant.",A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies,9678574,R41DK120253,"['Address', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data Set', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Freezing', 'Frozen Sections', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Organ Donor', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Slide', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Speed', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Transplanted tissue', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'commercial application', 'computerized', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'glomerulosclerosis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'power analysis', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'standard of care', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NIDDK,"NEWVENTUREIQ, LLC",R41,2018,214009,0.15992882740841674
"Early Identification of Acute Kidney Injury Using Deep Recurrent Neural Nets, Presented with Probable Etiology Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project we propose to develop Previse, a novel, software-based clinical decision support (CDS) system for predicting acute kidney injury (AKI), and attributing AKI to one of several causal mechanisms (etiologies). Previse will use machine learning methods and information drawn from the electronic health record (EHR) to identify the early signs of acute kidney injury. By doing so before the clinical syndrome of AKI is fully developed, Previse will give clinicians the time to intervene with the goals of preventing further kidney damage, and decreasing the sequelae of AKI. Combining this prediction module with a second module that suggests the underlying causes responsible for an incipient or full AKI, Previse will enable clinicians to make earlier and better-informed treatment decisions for AKI patients. Research Question: Can a machine- learning-based CDS predict the development and progression of AKI in hospitalized patients 72 hours in advance of KDIGO stage 2 or 3, with performance providing an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of at least 0.85? Is it possible to use a Bayesian model to infer the cause of AKI with high accuracy (AUROC ≥ 0.75)? Prior work: We have developed a prototype version of the Previse system which predicts AKI up to 72 hours in advance of KDIGO stage 2 or 3 criteria, with an AUROC near 0.70. We have previously developed machine-learning-based predictive tools for sepsis, in-hospital mortality, and other adverse patient events with performance significantly improved over commonly used rules-based scoring systems. Specific Aims: To predict the onset of chart-abstracted KDIGO stage 2 or 3 AKI in retrospective data, 72 hours in advance (Aim 1); to use data drawn from the EHR to identify the cause of AKI at time of onset with high accuracy, and to present this causal inference, its likelihood, and relevant evidence supporting it in a human-interpretable fashion (Aim 2). Methods: We will predict the onset of AKI using a deep, recurrent neural network (RNN). This expressive, nonlinear classifier will incorporate time-series information in the qualitative portions of the EHR and will also incorporate features derived from text components, such as radiology reports. Labeling AUROC of 0.85 or higher at 72 hours pre-KDIGO AKI will constitute success in Aim 1. In Aim 2, we will train a dynamic Bayesian network to identify the cause of AKI. We will train this system using semi-supervised methods, where the causes of a set of AKI examples will be hand-annotated by clinician experts; these examples will be split into two groups, with some used for training and the remainder for testing. Aim 2 will be successful if this training results in etiology identification accuracy of at least 0.75 in the test set. Future Directions: Following the proposed work, the combined Previse system will be deployed for prospective studies at partner hospitals. Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects approximately 7% of all hospitalized patients each year in the United States, causing short-term and lasting harm, including increased risk of mortality. However, the existing tools for acute kidney injury detection have failed to offer significant anticipation of full-blown AKI, or to provide the insight into the AKI’s root cause, which are needed to make an impact on patient outcomes. We will develop Previse, a machine-learning-based prediction system that continuously monitors for incipient AKI and offers clinicians probable root causes of AKI.","Early Identification of Acute Kidney Injury Using Deep Recurrent Neural Nets, Presented with Probable Etiology",9621546,R43AA027674,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head Start Program', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Plant Roots', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recurrence', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'computer based statistical methods', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool', 'trend']",NIAAA,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2018,349320,0.08464733953187352
"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9418599,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'forest', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'predictive test', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,336980,0.17768670997852193
"Nephrotic Syndrome Rare Disease Clinical Research Network II ABSTRACT Although patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) present with shared clinical signs and symptoms (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema), there is dramatic variability in prognosis and response to therapy, frustrating patients, families and their clinicians. Even within the histopathologic categories used in the current diagnostic approach (e.g. minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), there is dramatic variability in disease progression and response to therapy, highlighting the underlying biological heterogeneity within the groups. Small studies with broad, clinical patient inclusion criteria have demonstrated that a subset of patients respond well to certain immunosuppressive medications, but accurate pre-treatment response of those individuals is not possible based on routine clinical parameters. This project will leverage the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort study, a multi-center prospective study of over 600 patients with FSGS, MCD and MN with rich clinical data, kidney biopsy tissue and gene expression profiles. This study will leverage novel analysis tools to analyze the kidney tissue gene expression data to identify subgroups of patients with shared expression profiles. And, to combine this data with clinical characteristics and kidney biopsy pathology features to predict response to immunosuppressive therapy. It will utilize advanced analysis techniques which are ideal for rare disease when traditional statistical methods are not well equipped to identify relevant predictors from the large number of potential parameters across the genotype-phenotype continuum. The aims are: Aim 1: To utilize consensus non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) on glomerular and tubular genome wide mRNA expression data to identify functional subclasses of NEPTUNE participants. Aim 2: To utilize machine learning algorithms to identify predictors of response to initial immunosuppressive therapy from clinical characteristics, kidney biopsy pathology features and gene expression clusters. The objective is to improve the clinical care of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome by identifying novel, biologically-relevant predictors of treatment response. Risk stratification is useful not only to inform patients and clinicians who are making treatment decisions, but also allows stratification of patients at high risk of treatment failure into clinical trials of novel agents. LAY NARRATIVE Nephrotic Syndrome, caused by several rare kidney diseases, is characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, swelling and kidney failure. Patients affected by the syndrome suffer complications of the disease as well as the significant toxicity from the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat it, but their individual response to treatment and prognosis can vary markedly. This project aims to use clinical characteristics, gene expression levels from kidney biopsy tissue and pathology features from the kidney biopsy to quantify the likelihood that an individual person will fail to respond to immunosuppressive medications. This approach, if validated, may help to inform patients and clinicians about the risk of treatment failure.",Nephrotic Syndrome Rare Disease Clinical Research Network II,9716867,U54DK083912,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Edema', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis', 'Gene Expression', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Swelling', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'genetic signature', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'individual response', 'mRNA Expression', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U54,2018,71580,0.12817709822696566
"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure, hyper- tension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deﬁcits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantiﬁcation will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and dos- ing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workﬂow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma ﬂow and arterial input function, are difﬁcult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from signiﬁcant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma ﬂow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast ﬂow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma ﬂow (RPF) that lever- age novel ﬂow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated imag- ing methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults.

"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules. In this proposal we will perform high-content, high throughput screening for kidney regeneration in zebrafish to discover novel chemical probes to investigate mechanisms of augmented kidney regeneration after injury.",High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs,9406857,R01DK112652,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Breeding', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fibrosis', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Microsomes', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Organogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Prodrugs', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Renal tubule structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tubular formation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'kidney repair', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'organ growth', 'organ regeneration', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,351001,0.19461846486670495
"Big data in acute renal rejection PROJECT SUMMARY  Background: Acute rejection of renal transplant, i.e., the immunological response of the human body to a foreign kidney, is the main cause of dysfunction in renal transplant patients, surpassing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and immune drug toxicity. Over 650,000 patients in the US have end-stage renal disease and renal transplant offers the best outcome for these patients. However, 15%-27% of renal transplant patients have ARTR within 5 years, which if not detected and treated promptly, causes renal damage and leads to renal failure of the transplanted kidney. Currently, ARTR is initially evaluated using blood tests and urine sampling, e.g., plasma creatinine and creatinine clearance. However, these indices have low sensitivity, since a significant change in creatinine levels is only detectable after the loss of 60% of renal function. ARTR diagnosis requires renal biopsy (gold standard), which is invasive, takes a week for diagnosis, and costs up to $20,000. Further, needle biopsy is prone to over- or under-estimation of inflammation. The proposed study seeks to develop and validate a new noninvasive computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) software system that can provide highly accurate (over 97% accuracy) diagnosis of ARTR at an early stage by integrating laboratory-based biomarkers (e.g., creatinine clearance (CrCl) and serum plasma creatinine (SPCr)) with imaging-markers that will be extracted from either dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) or diffusion- weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI).  Objective/Hypotheses: The primary objective of this proposal is to develop and validate a clinically usable system for the early detection of acute renal transplant rejection (ARTR) based on testing the following three hypotheses: (i) The perfusion of the contrast agent in the cortex of the rejected kidney is slower than the perfusion of the contrast agent in the non-rejected kidney; (ii) The estimated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the cortex of the rejected kidney is smaller than the estimated ADC in the cortex of the non-rejected kidney; and (iii) Fusing laboratory-based biomarkers (e.g., CrCl and SPCr) with imaging-markers that will lead to novel fused indices for distinguishing rejected versus non-rejected kidneys in clinical decision-making.  Specific Aims: (i) Develop a software CAD system for early detection of acute renal transplant rejection based on integrating/fusing the estimated physiological perfusion parameters from DCE-MRI data with laboratory-based biomarkers for both rejected and non-rejected transplanted kidneys; (ii) Develop a software CAD system for early detection of acute renal transplant rejection based on integrating/fusing the estimated physiological diffusion parameters from DW-MRI data with laboratory-based biomarkers for both rejected and non-rejected transplanted kidneys; and (iii) Evaluate the accuracy of the proposed image analysis software system with clinical data that will be collected at University of Louisville (Approved IRB # 16.0041), University of Michigan (Approved IRB # HUM00115031), and the collected MRI data at The Kidney transplant center at Mansoura University with local regulatory approval.  Study Design: We will develop the following image analysis techniques to accurately analyze both DCE- MRI and DW-MRI: (i) segmentation of the kidney object from the surrounding abdominal structures for either DCE-MRI or DW-MRI using appearance and prior shape models; (ii) a Laplace-based non-rigid registration approach to handle local deformations in the kidney region caused by physiological effects (e.g., intrinsic pulsatile effects, breathing, or transmitted effects from adjacent structures, such as the bowel) during the data collection; (iii) segmentation of the kidney cortex and generation of either the physiological perfusion parameters (e.g., wash-in slope, wash-out slope, time-to-peak, and peak value) or physiological diffusion parameters (e.g., ADC); (iv) classification of the acute rejection versus non-rejection kidney status and evaluating the method as a diagnostic test; and (v) depiction of parametric maps of the estimated perfusion or diffusion indices to help clinical visual assessment of the transplanted kidney. The MRI and clinical data will be obtained from patients who have undergone kidney transplantation from live donors, and are available to our research team via Dr. Beache and Dr. Dwyer (Radiology Department and The Kidney Transplant Center at the University of Louisville, respectively) and Dr. Samaniego-Picota (Director of the Kidney Transplant Program and the Transplant Ambulatory Care Unit at the University of Michigan). In addition to the data that will be collected at the University of Louisville and the University of Michigan, our group has access to MRI data that had been collected from an additional 100 subjects at Mansoura University Hospital, Egypt. This data is available to our group through Dr. Abou El-Ghar, one of the PI collaborators, and it will be used to test the proposed CAD system on the data collected from another geographical area. Our preliminary diagnostic results, based on analysis of DCE-MRI data from 54 independent in-vivo cases using leave-one-subject-out approach were 98% accurate (sensitivity = 100.00%, specificity = 96%, and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) = 98%). Moreover, our preliminary results, based on the analysis of DW-MRI data from 75 independent in-vivo cases using leave-one-subject-out were 97% accurate (sensitivity = 98%, specificity = 96%, and DSC = 98%). These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed CAD system to complement current technologies such as nuclear imaging and ultrasonography to determine the type of kidney dysfunction post transplantation.

"Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups ABSTRACT Although patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) present with shared clinical signs and symptoms (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema), there is dramatic variability in prognosis and response to therapy, frustrating patients, families and their clinicians. Even within the histopathologic categories used in the current diagnostic approach (e.g. minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), there is dramatic variability in disease progression and response to therapy, highlighting the underlying biological heterogeneity within the groups. Small studies with broad, clinical patient inclusion criteria have demonstrated that a subset of patients respond well to anti-TNF therapy, but accurate pre-treatment response of those individuals is not possible based on routine clinical parameters. This project will leverage the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort study, a multi-center prospective study of 600 patients with FSGS, MCD and MN with rich clinical data, kidney biopsy tissue and gene expression profiles. This study will leverage the kidney tissue gene expression data to identify a subgroup of patients with TNF-alpha pathway activation, assess associated clinical outcomes and identify non- molecular predictors of the subgroup. The aims are:  Aim 1: To identify a subgroup of Nephrotic Syndrome patients with homogeneous activation of the  TNF-alpha transcriptional pathway.  Aim 2: To compare molecular subgroups with conventional clinical-pathologic classification in  clinical outcome prediction.  Aim 3: To identify non-invasive markers (e.g. demographics, blood and urine markers), standard  pathology features and novel pathologic biopsy descriptors associated with the TNF-alpha subgroup. To accomplish this project, the applicant will pursue formal training in systems biology, genetic epidemiology and bioinformatics. She will be mentored by a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in systems biology, epidemiology and bioinformatics. The long term objective is to improve the clinical care of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome by improved understanding of the underlying biology, identifying novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for future validation in animal models and mechanistic-based interventional clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nephrotic Syndrome, caused by several rare kidney diseases, is characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, swelling and kidney failure. Patients affected by the syndrome suffer complications of the disease as well as the toxicity of the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat it, but their individual presentations, response to treatment and prognosis can vary markedly. This project aims to use gene expression levels from kidney biopsy tissue to identify the subgroup patients most likely to respond to TNF- alpha blocking medications, an approach which, if validated, may help to inform targeted therapy selections for these patients.",Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups,9431752,K08DK115891,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Edema', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Membranous Glomerulonephritis', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Publications', 'Renal glomerular disease', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Subgroup', 'Swelling', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'predict clinical outcome', 'response', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2018,170193,0.11558879526888444

"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease.

For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue.

"Promoting Utilization of Kidneys by Improving Patient Level Decision Making ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Promoting Utilization of Kidneys by Improving Organ Acceptance Decision Making Only 15,652 of nearly 109,000 waitlisted patients for kidney transplant (KT) received one in 2014. More than six thousand died while waiting for a KT and more than two thousand became too sick to be transplanted. Patient survival, quality of life, and morbidity is significantly worse for those who remain on dialysis. The majority of kidneys that are transplanted are recovered from deceased donors. In 2014, while 12,664 kidneys were recovered for KT, 2,272 were discarded - most frequently due to being of marginal or low quality. Many of the discarded kidneys are believed to confer smaller survival gains than other procured kidneys. Previous studies show that the marginal kidneys offer survival benefits with respect to remaining on dialysis, but neglect quantification of these benefits to an individual patient. These studies ignore two major issues: (i) the low c-statistics of one and three year post-transplant patient and graft survival models; and (ii) dynamics of the organ offers and the current point based priority system for the waitlisted patients. Given these facts, from a decision maker's perspective, accepting or rejecting a low quality organ is not necessarily a well informed choice.  The proposed research takes a comprehensive approach in developing a survival model incorporating time on dialysis, recipient characteristics, transplant center characteristics, and donated kidney characteristics. It proposes to apply techniques from biostatistics and machine learning to improve model accuracy. The research further aims to quantify the dynamics of kidney availability of different quality organs, and model future kidney offers as a stochastic decision tree. The proposed computational engine for estimating the survival benefits of accepting or rejecting an offer will be transformative in clinical decision making. Moreover, th successful completion of the proposed research will provide a highly reliable approach to support kidney acceptance/rejection decisions. The research will be carried out by a trans- disciplinary team with expert knowledge in the transplant allocation system, decision methodologies, and clinical decision making. The research team will incorporate input from an external advisory board consisting of leaders and key stakeholders in kidney and pancreas transplant programs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The transplantation system in the United States discards hundreds of recovered kidneys annually. Many of the discarded kidneys are of marginal quality and are believed to confer smaller survival gains than other procured kidneys. The proposed research will take a comprehensive approach to accurately quantify patient survival and implications of accepting a kidney towards developing a decision support engine.

"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9306637,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'forest', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2017,340545,0.17768670997852193
"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules. In this proposal we will perform high-content, high throughput screening for kidney regeneration in zebrafish to discover novel chemical probes to investigate mechanisms of augmented kidney regeneration after injury.",High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs,9262478,R01DK112652,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Breeding', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fibrosis', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Microsomes', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Organogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Prodrugs', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Renal tubule structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tubular formation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'kidney repair', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'organ growth', 'organ regeneration', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,348188,0.19461846486670495
"Promoting Utilization of Kidneys by Improving Patient Level Decision Making ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Promoting Utilization of Kidneys by Improving Organ Acceptance Decision Making Only 15,652 of nearly 109,000 waitlisted patients for kidney transplant (KT) received one in 2014. More than six thousand died while waiting for a KT and more than two thousand became too sick to be transplanted. Patient survival, quality of life, and morbidity is significantly worse for those who remain on dialysis. The majority of kidneys that are transplanted are recovered from deceased donors. In 2014, while 12,664 kidneys were recovered for KT, 2,272 were discarded - most frequently due to being of marginal or low quality. Many of the discarded kidneys are believed to confer smaller survival gains than other procured kidneys. Previous studies show that the marginal kidneys offer survival benefits with respect to remaining on dialysis, but neglect quantification of these benefits to an individual patient. These studies ignore two major issues: (i) the low c-statistics of one and three year post-transplant patient and graft survival models; and (ii) dynamics of the organ offers and the current point based priority system for the waitlisted patients. Given these facts, from a decision maker's perspective, accepting or rejecting a low quality organ is not necessarily a well informed choice.  The proposed research takes a comprehensive approach in developing a survival model incorporating time on dialysis, recipient characteristics, transplant center characteristics, and donated kidney characteristics. It proposes to apply techniques from biostatistics and machine learning to improve model accuracy. The research further aims to quantify the dynamics of kidney availability of different quality organs, and model future kidney offers as a stochastic decision tree. The proposed computational engine for estimating the survival benefits of accepting or rejecting an offer will be transformative in clinical decision making. Moreover, th successful completion of the proposed research will provide a highly reliable approach to support kidney acceptance/rejection decisions. The research will be carried out by a trans- disciplinary team with expert knowledge in the transplant allocation system, decision methodologies, and clinical decision making. The research team will incorporate input from an external advisory board consisting of leaders and key stakeholders in kidney and pancreas transplant programs.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The transplantation system in the United States discards hundreds of recovered kidneys annually. Many of the discarded kidneys are of marginal quality and are believed to confer smaller survival gains than other procured kidneys. The proposed research will take a comprehensive approach to accurately quantify patient survival and implications of accepting a kidney towards developing a decision support engine.

"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease.

"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials. We propose to study novel methods for analyzing the large-scale biomedical data to realize their full potential of molecular diagnosis and prognosis of transplant rejection prediction for critical early treatment.          n/a",Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data,8079474,R01GM083345,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Fluids', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Experimental Designs', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Graft Rejection', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Oncogene Activation', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'allograft rejection', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer microarray', 'cancer type', 'design', 'improved', 'interest', 'kidney allograft', 'method development', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'software development', 'sound', 'theories', 'transplant database', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2011,250488,0.06552217878025406
"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education  with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in  clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic  kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral  funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an  independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD  care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician  (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on  experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research,  and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop  into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the  development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors.  In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and  large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel-  Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and  commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher.   An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his  research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and  the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to  develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum  chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed  logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will  conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model  in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients  for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with  an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care  delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data  mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and  implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher.   In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance  provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is  a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD.  Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of  Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in  predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical  informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a  highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise  in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the  general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and  CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of  disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models.  This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and  expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training.   To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal  coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical  Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational  Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial  implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research  and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses  that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills.   In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a  sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to  use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The  applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the  formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful  independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder.  Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor  health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney  disease without the use of blood work. This model will be implemented to alert doctors in real-time to screen  high-risk patients who may have unrecognized chronic kidney disease with the potential to substantially  improve the care of these patients.        Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder.

"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis.

"A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies ABSTRACT More people die every year from kidney disease than breast or prostate cancer. Kidney transplantation is life-saving, yet the donor organ shortage and high organ discard rate contributes to 13 deaths daily among patients awaiting transplant. The decision to use or discard a donor kidney relies heavily on microscopic quantitation of chronic damage by pathologists. The current standard of care relies on a manual process that is subject to significant human variability and inefficiency, resulting in potentially healthy kidneys being discarded and potentially damaged kidneys being transplanted inappropriately. Our team developed the first Deep Learning model to quantify percent global glomerulosclerosis in donor kidney frozen section biopsy whole slide images. We developed a cloud-based platform to apply the Deep Learning model to analyze kidney biopsy whole slide images in under 6 minutes with accuracy and precision equal to or greater than current standard of care pathologists. We have also developed a Deep Learning model to quantify interstitial fibrosis on donor kidney biopsy whole slide images. This innovative approach has the potential to transform donor kidney biopsy evaluation by improving pathologist efficiency, accuracy, and precision ultimately resulting in optimized donor organ utilization, improved patient outcomes, and diminished health care costs. The goal of this project is to establish our Deep Learning automated techniques as the standard for evaluating donor kidneys prior to transplantation. This will be achieved by assembling a team of expert pathologists and computer scientists specializing in machine learning. The proposal will evaluate the accuracy and precision of the interstitial fibrosis Deep Learning model, use the automated quantitation of key microscopic findings to develop an outcome-based chronic damage score that predicts graft outcome, and test the ability of the Deep Learning models to withstand variations encountered using different scanners and processing in different laboratories. The functionality of the Trusted Kidney software platform will be improved beyond the current usable product into a commercially viable solution for multiple laboratories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Before kidneys can be transplanted, they must be examined using a microscope to ensure the kidney is healthy enough for transplant. A limitation of microscopic examination by pathologists is the inherent human variability in quantifying the amount of scar tissue, or chronic damage, present. The result is potentially healthy organs being discarded or damaged kidneys being used inappropriately. This funding will support developing artificial intelligence tools to assist pathologists with quantifying scar tissue in donor kidneys prior to transplantation, resulting in more consistent and objective biopsy evaluations, minimizing discard of potentially healthy kidneys, and optimizing placement of kidneys for transplant.",A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies,10138826,R42DK120253,"['Adoption', 'Americas', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biopsy', 'Canada', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Fibrosis', 'Frozen Sections', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Graft Survival', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Midwestern United States', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Organ Donor', 'Organ Procurements', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Personnel', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Slide', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transplantation', 'Trichrome stain', 'Trichrome stain method', 'Trust', 'United Network for Organ Sharing', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'functional improvement', 'glomerulosclerosis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'pathology imaging', 'phase 1 study', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'renal damage', 'shared database', 'standard of care', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NIDDK,"NEWVENTUREIQ, LLC",R42,2020,811695,0.20008673108668137
"Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease Project Summary Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent in the U.S. population and is a major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease morbidity, and mortality. Current gaps exist in characterizing the heterogeneity of CKD population. Obesity further increases the risks of adverse outcomes among people with impaired kidney function. However, the mechanism between obesity and CKD is not fully understood, and numerous studies have observed “obesity paradox” or survival advantage being associated with higher body fat among advanced CKD patients. In this context, the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study provides an ideal opportunity to study the mechanism of CKD with its rich clinical information and population characteristics, as well as its availability of non-targeted high-dimensional metabolomics data. To better understand the “adiposity-obesity-related” (AOR) mechanisms of CKD and to discover novel biomarkers, we propose to identify distinct subgroups based on AOR attributes and to perform metabolomics analysis on the identified subgroups and CKD outcomes. The overall goal of this research and the training plan is to execute three studies as the subjects of a doctoral dissertation in metabolomics analysis and CKD epidemiology. First, in Aim 1, we will identify latent AOR subgroups in the CRIC CKD population using the data-driven approach of consensus clustering. We will also evaluate the utility and the independent risk discrimination performance of the AOR subgroups with key CKD outcomes (CKD progression, CVD, and death), using Cox regression model with adjustment for known CKD risk factors. Next, in Aim 2, we will perform metabolomics analysis and identify metabolites and metabolomic patterns that are associated with the different AOR subgroups. In response to the statistical challenges in analyzing the high-dimensional metabolomics data, we will implement both the machine learning random-forest algorithm and the conventional univariate and multivariate regression analysis. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the relationship between CKD outcomes and the metabolites and metabolomic patterns identified in Aim 2, using Cox regression model, extended by pathway analysis and mediation analysis. Mining high-dimensional metabolomics data with AOR phenotypes in the CRIC Study holds promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD. Future studies can be built upon these findings to improve more effective and personalized CKD management in the setting of the obesity epidemic. A rigorous curriculum including didactic and experiential learning in biomedical data mining, statistics, and advanced epidemiology will round out the applicant's training, preparing her to be an independent and collaborative investigator and a kidney disease epidemiologist at the completion of his PhD. Project Narrative Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its risk factors of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are prevalent in the United States. To better understand the mechanism between adiposity-obesity-related CKD mechanism, the proposed research will implement machine learning algorithms, and identify distinct patient subgroups and discover novel CKD biomarkers, using the clinical and high-dimensional metabolomics data from a diverse cohort of CKD patients. The findings of our study hold promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD, and facilitate personalized disease management.",Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease,9964494,F31DK122683,"['Active Learning', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body fat', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Curriculum', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Kynurenine', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome Assessment', 'PTH gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Troponin T', 'Tryptophan', 'United States', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'patient subsets', 'personalized management', 'population based', 'preservation', 'random forest', 'response', 'statistics', 'targeted biomarker', 'tool']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,0.08517297350431277
"Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches for Renal Structure Characterization in Computed Tomography Images ABSTRACT The goal of this R03 Small Grant Program for NIDDK is to provide additional funding for Dr. Kline to expand upon his work on his K award and apply his expertise to new image acquisitions and problems related to renal imaging. Dr. Kline’s work has piqued the interest of many internal and external investigators and has led to recent collaborations with Drs. Rule, Denic, and Kim. Together with Dr. Erickson, this new research team has prepared this R03 proposal which takes advantage of the unique expertise of each team member. The focus of this proposal is to bridge the gap between microscopic observations and those assessable non-invasively by radiological imaging. To do this, we have established a unique dataset of renal CT imaging data and corresponding biopsy measured nephron densities. We have also generated a large database of gold-standard segmentation data of kidneys, cortical regions, and medullary pyramids. Using this existing data, we propose to: (i) develop tools for segmentation of kidneys, segmentation of individual medullary pyramids, and imputing missing parts of the kidneys outside of the imaged field-of-view in the CT image, and (ii) to establish imaging biomarkers of early CKD, and correlate macroscopic imaging findings to underlying microscopic structure. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic’s outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Aging Kidney Anatomy Study (PI: Rule), which led to the generation of this unique and well characterized dataset. Dr. Kline’s background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly well suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, near the end of this research project Dr. Kline will submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of renal imaging biomarkers. Obtaining this R03 Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline’s transition into a prosperous independent researcher focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. Narrative Non-invasive methods for characterizing micro-structural changes of the kidney during aging as well as in health and disease are currently not possible. This research program proposes to use our existing database of renal imaging and renal biopsy data to bridge the gap between macroscopic radiological findings on computed tomography images to those assessable in microscopic images of renal biopsies. This program will develop new automated methods for performing measurements on the images, as well as use machine/deep learning methods to search for new imaging biomarkers that relate to nephron density and size, as well as establish their usefulness for early chronic kidney disease detection and transplant planning.",Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches for Renal Structure Characterization in Computed Tomography Images,10040835,R03DK125632,"['Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Albuminuria', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Award', 'Biopsy', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrons', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Stenosis', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Tubular formation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated analysis', 'automated image analysis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'density', 'early detection biomarkers', 'graft failure', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'learning strategy', 'living kidney donor', 'member', 'microscopic imaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technology', 'personalized decision', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'radiological imaging', 'research clinical testing', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R03,2020,113350,0.06648945390551367
"Artificial Intelligence to Predict Outcomes in Patients with Acute Kidney Injury on Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects up to half of critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU). In patients with AKI and hemodynamic instability, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the preferred dialysis modality for solute and volume control. ICU mortality in this vulnerable population is high (~75%) but kidney recovery occurs in up to two-thirds of survivors. Fluid overload is a potentially modifiable risk factor associated with these outcomes. However, there are currently no universally accepted approaches for predicting kidney recovery, survival or individual response to fluid removal during CRRT. Due to recent advances in computer science and widespread big data usage, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a valuable approach. DL allows construction of risk prediction models using time-series data that incorporate thousands of variables and dynamic changes in these variables derived from multi-dimensional sources and not only static values of these variables. We propose to develop and validate innovative DL approaches to dynamically predict these outcomes using multi-modal data from electronic health records and CRRT machines. We demonstrated superiority of DL models without a-priori variable selection compared to optimized logistic regression (C-Statistic of 0.72 vs. 0.62) for prediction of RRT liberation. We also showed that mortality prediction improved by incorporating changes in clinical data within 6-hour intervals after CRRT initiation. In addition, we identified distinctive mortality risk according to quintiles of achieved net ultrafiltration rates, after adjustment by patient’s weight, duration of CRRT, and other clinical parameters: OR 8.0 (95% CI: 2.7-25.1) when the highest quintile (>36 ml/kg/day) was compared to the lowest quintile (<13 ml/kg/day). We hypothesize that innovative DL approaches integrating time- series data will generate accurate and generalizable risk prediction models that can impact CRRT delivery. We will utilize a multi-institutional dataset that encompasses clinical data and CRRT programmatic and therapy data (CRRTnet registry, n=1500 patients) for model development and an independent multi-institutional dataset for validation (n=1500 patients) to: 1) continuously predict short-term (7-day) and medium-term (28-day) liberation from RRT due to kidney recovery; 2) continuously predict 24-hour mortality; and 3) identify and validate sub- phenotypes of patients with AKI on CRRT with differing achieved net ultrafiltration rates. This innovative research will assist 1) the development of novel clinical decision support platforms for guiding informed CRRT delivery and promoting kidney recovery; 2) the identification of sub-phenotypes of patients that can benefit from precision- medicine approaches to fluid removal during CRRT; and 3) the design of interventional studies focusing on fluid removal during CRRT to impact patient-centered outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the preferred dialysis treatment for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and hemodynamic instability, yet mortality is high (~75%). Presently, there are no universally accepted approaches for predicting kidney recovery, survival or individual response to fluid removal during CRRT. We propose to develop and validate innovative deep learning approaches to dynamically predict these outcomes, which could guide CRRT decision-making including intensification, de-escalation, and enrich clinical trials focusing on fluid removal during CRRT.",Artificial Intelligence to Predict Outcomes in Patients with Acute Kidney Injury on Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy,10261059,R56DK126930,"['Acute', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Fluid overload', 'Goals', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hour', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kidney', 'Liquid substance', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Survivors', 'Time', 'Ultrafiltration', 'Validation', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individual response', 'innovation', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'risk prediction model', 'solute', 'therapy design', 'time use']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R56,2020,100000,0.13122034955210274
"Artificial intelligence-enabled, real-time communication software for optimizing clinical decision making during the allocation, procurement, and transplantation of donated organs Project Abstract for HealthTech Solutions Kidney transplantation is a clinically effective and cost-effective treatment for patients suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and diabetes. Twenty-two patients die each day waiting for a transplant and 30% of all deaths in the US could be prevented by organ transplant. Despite the obvious clinical and cost-effective advantages of kidney transplantation, there has been a decades-long rise in the kidney discard rate from 5.1% in 1988 to 19.2% in 2015. During a successful Phase I grant and to address the need for a dedicated communications system to help improve transplant patient outcomes and achieve greater donated organ utilization, HealthTech Solutions (HTS), Inc. developed a proprietary mobile application for secure team communication tailored specifically for kidney transplant teams. To further improve communication efficiency and augment critical decision making in healthcare, specifically for surgeons, HTS will employ machine learning (ML) powered clinical decision support. Clinical decision support (CDS) may significantly increase access, increase quality, and reduce the cost of kidney transplantation. The proposed project is designed to further test and quantify the improvement of the donor management, coordination process, and kidney utilization outcomes using the company’s CDS and communication infrastructure for medical team communication. The aims are; 1) Develop CDS models specifically for transplant professionals aimed at improving decision times and decision confidence. Develop the CDS infrastructure capable of handling medical data and serving insights safely, securely, and rapidly; 2) Asses usability by working with a test group to exceed usability criteria and ensure that CDS meets clinician needs through user feedback iterations. Verification of utility from a diversified testing group (n=10) that represent every type of professional involved in transplant cases. 3) Measure the effects of TXP Chat enhanced with CDS after live clinical implementation in the kidney offer and procurement processes for more than 3,000 offers (1,500 with CDS and 1,500 control) over a period of 365 days with multiple partner institutions (n=3). TXP Chat and CDS will demonstrate to be reliable, secure, trustworthy and useful by the clinical/technical community, increase kidney acceptance practices resulting in an increase in kidney transplants, reduction in cold ischemic time, and reduction in time from offer to transplant. Ultimately, these metrics have been demonstrated in the literature to improve patient outcomes, reduce expensive chronic treatment costs (e.g. dialysis), reduce patient deaths from lack of kidney availability, and significantly improve human health and productivity. Study results will be disseminated via publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Aim 1 will lay the foundation for further development to enable wider CDS in the Phase IIB. Aim 2 will prove physician support and steady adoption trend as we roll into commercialization. Aim 3 will provide multi-center pilot study data used to prove increased efficiency of the process in terms of time, money, and total number of kidneys transplanted. Project Narrative Despite the obvious clinical and cost-effectiveness advantages of kidney transplantation for many patients, nearly 1 in 5 kidneys authorized for donation are discarded. This project addresses the need for an efficient communications software technology enhanced with clinical decision support tailored for organ procurement organizations and transplant centers. Combined with enhanced communication efficiency, clinical decision support powered by machine learning may significantly improve donated kidney utilization and increase the number of viable, but currently unused organs that could otherwise be successfully transplanted, reducing waste and saving lives.","Artificial intelligence-enabled, real-time communication software for optimizing clinical decision making during the allocation, procurement, and transplantation of donated organs",10017295,R44LM012575,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asses', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Direct Costs', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Journals', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Multiple Partners', 'Organ', 'Organ Procurements', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Renal Glycosuria', 'Reporting', 'Savings', 'Secure', 'Surgeon', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Cost', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'burnout', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical implementation', 'cohesion', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'mobile application', 'operation', 'prevent', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'transmission process', 'transplant centers', 'trend', 'usability', 'wasting']",NLM,ORGANIZER,R44,2020,975104,0.17136999959668633
"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9923450,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'kidney dysfunction', 'machine learning method', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'predictive test', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'random forest', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,334508,0.17768670997852193
"A new approach to predict graft outcome from histology in children undergoing kidney transplantation using machine learning methods Abstract Although the overall renal graft survival has dramatically improved over the last several decades, almost half of pediatric patients lose their transplant within 10 years. Epidemiology, immunology and histology are all key elements in understanding post-transplant complications and in predicting clinical outcomes, however accurate prediction of transplant outcomes remains challenging and understudied among pediatric kidney transplant recipients. Machine learning technology is rapidly advancing and has demonstrated remarkable predictive accuracy surpassing classical predictive models in several biomedical applications. The goal of this research proposal is to develop machine learning methods to improve prediction of transplant outcomes through analysis of histology, assemble data sufficient to describe the incidence of different types of rejection and histological findings on pediatric kidney transplant biopsies, and to assess their impact on graft outcome. To achieve these goals, we will assemble an international multicenter cohort of over 700 pediatric kidney transplant recipients and develop and validate machine-learning models combining clinical, immunological and histological data for predicting short-term pediatric graft outcomes. This study will enable accurate, reproducible, and standardized assessment of histopathological findings in pediatric transplant recipients and provide a new method to predict graft outcome. This will pave the way to future large, prospective study assessing the feasibility and potential impact of machine-learning methods in transplant biopsy analysis, with the goal of improving clinical management and resource utilization by identifying patients with high risk of graft loss. Finally, this study will provide critical information for efficient and effective design of clinical trials focused on improving outcomes of pediatric kidney transplant recipients, with an emphasis on individualized treatment. Project Narrative: Accurate prediction of graft outcome in pediatric kidney transplant patients is critical to individualize patients' management and treatment and to design efficient and effective clinical trials focused on improving outcomes of these patients. Our long-term goal is to improve the assessment of histopathological findings in pediatric transplant recipients and create a new systematic methodology to predict graft outcomes that can be applied nationally and internationally.

"Enhanced Diagnosis of Antibody-Mediated Kidney Rejection by Machine Learning and Hybrid Targeted-Shotgun Proteomics Kidney transplantation offers the best quality of life for patients with chronic kidney failure. Antibody and T-cell mediated rejection (ABMR and TCMR) are key factors that determine graft survival. Currently, the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of rejection relies on histopathologic examination which has known limitations such as subjective interpretations, limited reproducibility, and the need for expert transplant pathologists. There is an unmet need to develop more specific and quantitative molecular tests that can complement and enhance conventional histologic assessment. Among the molecular assays, proteome profiling is more attractive than genomic and transcriptomic profiling which are subjected to numerous post-translational and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Moreover, morphologic changes form the basis of classifying different allograft diseases. Therefore, the transplant community needs to invest in biopsy-based assays in addition to the blood/urine-based assays that are being developed by others. This study is aimed to fully map the proteomic changes in routinely processed formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies using a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) platform. To meet the needs of personalized medicine, this platform uses a novel strategy and machine learning to simultaneously measure the absolute expression levels of a panel of targeted biomarkers as well as thousands of untargeted proteins. The central hypothesis is that LC-MS/MS can be used to define disease-specific biomarkers using a discovery data set, which can then be followed up by a validation data set to determine if LC-MS/MS based tests can be implemented in clinical practice. In the current project, we will focus on developing molecular assays for ABMR since antibody contributes to graft loss in 60% of patients. Two Aims are proposed. In Aim #1, quantitative proteomic strategies will be used to map proteome-level changes in a discovery set of biopsies with ABMR and its mimics, such as acute tubular injury (ATI), TCMR, BK virus nephropathy (BKVN), interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), and stable renal function (STA). The goal is to identify potential protein biomarkers that can distinguish ABMR from its mimics. In Aim #2, the potential ABMR biomarkers obtained in Aim #1 will be validated and optimized in an independent validation data set. Using a hybrid proteomic platform combing targeted, shotgun proteomics and machine learning, information on absolute quantitation of potential protein biomarkers and thousands of other proteins will be collected to build a kidney transplant Protein Atlas for assay development. Successful completion of this study has great potential to be translated into clinical tests that will enhance the diagnosis of ABMR from other diseases that can mimic that pathology. It will also serve as a model for developing a new generation of clincal diagnositc tests that will use routinely fixed biopsy materials. This will eliminate the need for intense biobanking efforts, which have hampered the more widespread implementation of molecular diagnostics into the transplant clinic. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is aimed at devising more accurate and reliable tests for diagnosing rejection of transplanted kidneys. Better tests will lead to more effective treatment, prolong graft life, and improve the quality of life for patients with chronic kidney failure.",Enhanced Diagnosis of Antibody-Mediated Kidney Rejection by Machine Learning and Hybrid Targeted-Shotgun Proteomics,10055012,R21AI148776,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Atlases', 'Atrophic', 'BK Virus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Comb animal structure', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fibrosis', 'Formalin', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft Survival', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hybrids', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Quality of life', 'RNA', 'RNA analysis', 'Reaction', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shotguns', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'assay development', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'burden of illness', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'complement C4d', 'cost', 'design', 'differential expression', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'histological specimens', 'histopathological examination', 'improved', 'interstitial', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular diagnostics', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'preservation', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein expression', 'proteomic signature', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'synthetic peptide', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'targeted biomarker', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2020,234008,0.08837283202167197
"DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation Contact PD/PI: Fereidouni, Farzad Abstract Kidneys, like other organs, have an inherent capacity to recover from acute injury; however, severe or recurrent injury can result in chronic kidney disease (CKD), the sequelae of which result in 82,000 deaths annually in the US alone. Regardless of the etiology of the initial injury, the common final pathway leading to- end stage renal disease is closely connected to fibrosis(excess or aberrant collagen distribution), one of the most important determinants of renal disease severity and prognosis. Histology is the gold standard for evaluation, typically through the use of histochemical stains such as trichrome and PAS that highlight the presence of collagens and basement membrane, respectively. Nevertheless, these stains are not completely specific, can be technically challenging to perform well and reproducibly, and thus contribute to interobserver variability and a concomitant decrease in diagnostic precision. Moreover, they also require the preparation of extra slides and additional staining procedures, and thus increase cost and can prolong the diagnostic process. We propose to optimize, deploy and test a new kind of microscope, DUET (DUal mode Emission and Transmission microscopy), developed at UC Davis, that will be a low-cost and very rapid solution for detection and digital characterization of the presence and distribution of collagen and other macromolecules, directly from standard formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Specifically, we will finalize the design of the hardware and software components of the instrument itself, validate imaging performance against standard histology and immunohistochemical stains for collagen and other components, and with the assistance of scientists at our partnering institutions (John Hopkins University and University of Buffalo) develop robust tools for analysis and quantitation of fibrosis. DUET instrument hardware will be shared with JHU to ensure that the methods are technically reproducible across multiple sites. The application leverages the expertise across three institutions in optics, biomedical engineering, renal pathology and novel artificial intelligence approaches. The goal of the project is development and validation of DUET, which promises to be a robust, inexpensive and practical approach for the rapid and accurate evaluation of fibrosis, extensible to other renal pathologies, and indeed across other organs systems, with significant positive impact on disease research, clinical practice, and patient outcomes. Page 6 Project Summary/Abstract Project Narrative Evaluation of fibrosis and tubular atrophy from chemically stained kidney biopsies are essential for diagnosis and disease-severity assessment, but current techniques are time-consuming, somewhat non-specific and contribute to interobserver variability and imprecision, affecting care. We propose to optimize and test a new kind of microscope (“DUET”) that can visualize fibrosis (scarring) and other tissue abnormalities directly from standard slides to enable high-quality reproducible fibrosis scoring and evaluation. This multi-site project will also provide a unique opportunity to perform a retrospective study from hundreds of existing H&E slides with associated months to years of clinical follow-up data, and to create a method with demonstrated utility in more than one institution.",DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation,10261643,R56DK124873,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Basement membrane', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Buffaloes', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrillar Collagen', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Natural History', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirius Red F3B', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Trichrome stain method', 'Tubular formation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'follow-up', 'histological stains', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney fibrosis', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'software development', 'stem', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R56,2020,91725,0.07855623223699651
"Transforming Kidney Care in the Emergency Department using Artificial Intelligence Driven Clinical Decision Support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this proposal is to determine best-practice methods for incorporating artificial intelligence (AI)- derived insights into emergency care. This investigation will use the iterative development and evaluation of an AI-driven clinical decision support (CDS) system to prevent or mitigate acute kidney injury (AKI) as a reference use-case. We are responding to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice: Health Services Research Priorities for Achieving a High Value Healthcare System (NOT-HS-18-015), calling for research on prevention of disease through incorporation of AI into healthcare and on interventions to prevent kidney disease progression. Emergency departments (EDs) deliver high-volume patient care in hazardous decision-making environments fraught with excessive cognitive loading and time-pressure. AI has potential to support ED clinician decisions by exploiting large-scale electronic health record (EHR) data to aid prognosis, extract signal from noise, and reduce untoward variability in practice. Despite AI’s fervent promotion, translation to practice is rare and means to incorporate AI that is trustworthy, transparent, and explainable in the ED are unknown. AKI is an important target for AI-driven predictive modeling. It is prevalent and strongly associated with adverse outcomes including dialysis and death, yet is under-recognized and therefore under-treated. In addition, many ED treatments inadvertently promote the progression of AKI and kidney disease. AKI prevention is achievable with evidence-based CDS at the point of care. We will use our AI-driven model, with proven capacity for early and reliable AKI risk estimation, to achieve the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Develop an AI-driven algorithm for promotion of AKI-focused clinical decision-making in the ED. We will leverage previously developed AKI surveillance and prediction tools to generate a unified EHR-based algorithm that empowers ED clinician prevention of kidney disease progression. Aim 2: Translate the AI algorithm to an AKI-CDS system to enable in-depth study of Clinician-AI interactions in the ED. We will establish end-user requirements while creating data collection instruments to examine AI in the ED. Both efforts will support the development of the AKI-CDS system to pilot and investigate ED clinician perceptions of AI trustworthiness and explainability in preparation for multi-site implementation. Aim 3: Perform a multi-site effectiveness-implementation evaluation of the AKI-CDS system in the ED. We will implement the AI-driven CDS system across three ED study sites using a pragmatic investigational framework to perform effectiveness and implementation evaluations in parallel. The research proposed will generate new knowledge and tools to advance the study of AI in the ED, and will result in a scalable CDS product with the capacity to improve the quality of kidney care delivered to more than 1 million patients affected by AKI in the US each year.

"Prediction of Major Adverse Kidney Events and Recovery (Pred-MAKER) in COVID-19 Patients PROJECT SUMMARY  Major adverse kidney events (MAKE) are common in individuals hospitalized with COVID-19, particularly in the United States. Our data from Mount Sinai show that ~40% of hospitalized patients develop acute kidney injury (AKI); 20% of those need renal replacement therapy, and the mortality rate in patients that experience COVID-19 associated AKI is several-fold greater than patients without AKI. Furthermore, we have seen that the rate of non-recovery is also significantly higher compared to those observed in non-COVID AKI, highlighting the potential long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2-associated kidney damage. We propose to utilize the highly coordinated tissue and biospecimen collection machinery that has been initiated at the Mount Sinai Health System. As the largest hospital system at the epicenter of the crisis, Mount Sinai treated and discharged nearly 10,000 COVID-19 patients and created a central IRB approval and data coordination system under the auspices of the newly formed Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center. As part of biospecimen and clinical data collation efforts, we have consented and obtained blood, urine or clinically indicated kidney biopsy samples from over 700 patients at the time of admission.  Using these samples, we propose (1) to use a multipronged approach to determine the biomarkers that are associated with MAKE; (2) to develop a machine learning-based predictive algorithm using a combination of multiplexed biomarker expression levels and clinical metrics; and, (3) to determine cellular pathways that are responsible for COVID-associated AKI by combining multiomics interrogation of SARS-CoV-2 positive patient urine and kidney biopsies as well as the time-dependent transcriptomic signatures of in vitro primary proximal tubule cells.  First, our results will have an immediate translational outcome, which will help focus clinical efforts on high risk patients and triage low risk patients quicker. In addition, our proposal will lead to improved understanding of the complex disease mechanisms that cause the unique kidney injury signatures in COVID-19 and may lead to development of novel biomarkers and therapeutics that may prove beneficial during post-COVID clinical care. Our rigorous approach is innovative, and it is supported by established complementary assays. We have assembled an experienced multidisciplinary team encompassing bioengineers, nephrologists, basic scientists, informaticians and virologists that will help improve the understanding of the landscape of kidney outcomes during COVID-19 hospitalizations. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Kidney podocytes play an important role in kidney filtration. In order to perform this key biological function, the podocyte has to maintain a specialized structure that depends on a number of proteins. We identified a previously unknown protein, called nebulette, as a key component of the podocyte filtration machinery, and we propose to test its role in maintenance of the specialized structure of podocytes during health and disease. Our results will improve our understanding of podocyte biology and may identify new drug targets to treat kidney diseases such as diabetic nephropathy.",Prediction of Major Adverse Kidney Events and Recovery (Pred-MAKER) in COVID-19 Patients,10216732,R01DK118222,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coca', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Consultations', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Health system', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'In Situ', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nephrology', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteinuria', 'Proteomics', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scientist', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Triage', 'Tubular formation', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Vaccines', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'coronavirus disease', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'kidney biopsy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'podocyte', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'proteomic signature', 'renal damage', 'response', 'sample collection', 'spatiotemporal', 'transcriptomics', 'translational impact', 'urinary', 'virology']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,468762,0.2230664059711571
"Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival  Chronic kidney disease affects about 10% of adults in the United States and 7-12% of the population worldwide. It may lead to irreversible loss of kidney function, known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For patients with ESRD, kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment compared to dialysis in terms of patient survival, quality of life and cost. Despite the advantages of kidney transplants, most patients with ESRD are treated with dialysis primarily because there exist an insufficient number of compatible donors for patients. The human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) of the organ donor and recipient are known to be a significant contributing factor to transplanted organ survival times due to immunogenicity, the immune response of the recipient to the transplanted organ. Mismatches between donor and recipient HLAs are associated with shorter survival times; however, it is extremely rare to identify donors that have a perfect match with recipients, so most transplants involve mismatched HLAs. Our main objective is to accurately predict survival times for kidney transplants by incorporating both data- driven models of HLA compatibility based on outcomes of past transplants and biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity. Accurate prediction of survival times can improve patient transplant outcomes by enabling more efficient allocation of donors and recipients, particularly by reducing the number of repeat transplants due to graft failure with a poorly matched donor. We propose to estimate HLA compatibilities using high-dimensional variable selection techniques applied to outcomes of past transplants and through a novel donor-recipient latent space model for the HLA compatibility network. We then propose to incorporate these predicted compatibilities along with biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity using amino acid sequences and epitopes into a multi-task classification-based survival prediction algorithm. Our proposed approach for learning integrated data- and biologically-driven models of transplant survival generalizes broadly to organ transplantation (liver, heart, pancreas, lungs) and possibly to bone marrow transplantation. Finding better methods for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and recipient may redefine and improve clinical outcomes for organ and tissue transplants. In fact, new approach may revolutionize the selection of donors with recipients, thereby producing significantly improved long-term organ and tissue transplant survivals.",Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival ,9985180,R01LM013311,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens', 'Anus', 'Biological', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Donor Selection', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epitopes', 'HLA Antigens', 'Heart', 'Immune response', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ Donor', 'Organ Survival', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Science', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'base', 'cost', 'discrete time', 'graft failure', 'hazard', 'high dimensionality', 'human model', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'learning network', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'survival prediction', 'transplant model', 'treatment comparison']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO,R01,2020,277764,0.13058617321576746
"Understanding the role of the Complement Proteome in progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT There is a critical need to identify novel mechanisms of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) that will provide targets for new interventions. Chronic inflammation is one plausible mechanism. Using untargeted high-throughput aptamer proteomics, our recently published study has shed new light on specific, key inflammatory drivers of DKD. This was a large prospective three-cohort study that identified a novel and extremely robust circulating signature (KRIS) associated with risk of ESRD in diabetes. Our pilot study points to the data-driven connection between circulating KRIS and urinary profiles of the Complement pathway. Our hypothesis is that the Complement involvement in the kidney is a downstream effect of the systemic inflammatory processes mediating an increased DKD risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide a high-resolution view of the involvement of the Complement proteome in progressive diabetic kidney disease. Aim 1 will comprehensively evaluate the etiological role of the urinary Complement proteome in progressive DKD leading to ESRD. This evaluation will leverage a prospective two-cohort population of Joslin Kidney Study (JKS) participants with an overt DKD at baseline followed for 10 years (primary outcome – incident ESRD). Measurements will utilize an aptamer proteomic technology (SOMAscan). Aim 2 will extend generalizability of the urinary Complement proteome to earlier DKD stages. The proposed study will be conducted in participants of the Preventing Early Renal Loss (PERL) clinical trial with predominantly normal renal function at baseline followed for 3 years (primary outcome - renal slope). Aim 3 proposes to gain direct insight into the intra-renal Complement proteome by targeted and untargeted protein studies in diabetic kidney tissue (Susztaklab Biobank). This project focuses on a significant public health problem, leverages the progressiveness of the disease, employs an innovative proteomic technology and stems from strong preliminary data. Advances in this project will pinpoint missing key components of DKD etiology, thereby accelerating drug development strategies for patients with diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetes accounts for approximately 45% of prevalent ESRD cases in the United States, therefore new interventions to prevent or decelerate development of kidney failure are critical in order to improve the health of patients with diabetes who comprise a large sector of the US population. This study will advance our knowledge regarding the etiology of diabetic kidney complications evaluating specific components of systemic (KRIS) and local, kidney inflammation (Complement).

"A Systems Biology and Patient Stratification Approach to Improve Outcomes of Patients with Hypoxic Injury in Renal Tubular Cells in Chronic Kidney Diseases ABSTRACT  Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health epidemic and patients with CKD suffer from increased mortality and cardiovascular disease. Despite the severity of the disease, there are limited treatment options to hinder its progression. Tubular injury (TI) is a common finding on many kidney biopsies from patients with CKD, and there is mechanistic data supporting that TI can lead to interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. While interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy are the strongest known pathologic predictor of progression of CKD, we have limited understand of how TI contributes to this progression. Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α (HIF-1α) has been shown in animal studies to impact the severity of TI and is also known to trigger a fibrotic cascade, but there is limited data regarding its overall activity in kidney tissue, its cell type specific activity, its association with pathologic features or patient outcomes. It is of utmost importance to better understand this pathway as several Prolyl Hydroxylase inhibitors, which are novel therapeutic agents that increase the expression of HIF- 1α, are currently in clinical trial testing to treat anemia of CKD. The first aim of this proposal is to develop a measure of HIF-1α pathway activity that enables evaluation of clinical and morphologic features and cell-type specificity. Specifically, the candidate will a) Identify clinical and pathologic descriptors associated with increased HIF-1α pathway activity score and b) Determine the cell-type specific expression level of HIF-1α and its downstream components in tubular cells using single-cell RNA-sequencing. The second aim of this proposal is to determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity with outcomes and identify patients with increased HIF-1α activity non-invasively using biomarkers. Specifically, the candidate will a) Determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity score with patient outcomes and b) Identify serum or urine biomarkers that detect increased HIF-1α pathway activity in patients. The candidate will analyze data from 3 cohorts to accomplish these aims: Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE), Clinical Phenotyping Resource and Biobank Core (C-PROBE) and the Native Americans with Type 2 Diabetes cohort (formerly known as the Pima Indian cohort). These investigations will allow us to monitor HIF-1α activity non-invasively in trials where patients receive novel drug agents, such as Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitors.  The candidate will obtain formal training in analysis of gene expression data, single cell RNA- sequencing and machine learning techniques during the course of the award period to successfully integrate gene expression data, pathology data and clinical data. She will be mentored by an expert team with complementary experience in nephrology, tubular injury biology, systems biology and bioinformatics. The long-term goal of these investigations is to ultimately be able to better sub-type patients with tubular injury based on mechanistic terms. NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease is a global health epidemic and is associated with increased mortality, but we do not have a detailed understanding of why this disease progresses. Identifying sub-types of patients who progress by the same molecular mechanism is important to identify patients for future clinical trials. This project aims to use gene expression data from kidney biopsies to identify patients who will respond differently to medications that increase the expression of Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 alpha.",A Systems Biology and Patient Stratification Approach to Improve Outcomes of Patients with Hypoxic Injury in Renal Tubular Cells in Chronic Kidney Diseases,9948349,K08DK124449,"['Address', 'Anemia', 'Animals', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrophic', 'Award', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemic', 'Erythropoietin', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Hypoxia', 'Hypoxia Inducible Factor', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Native Americans', 'Nephrology', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pima Indian', 'Process', 'Procollagen-Proline Dioxygenase', 'Production', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'experience', 'global health', 'glomerulosclerosis', 'hypoxia inducible factor 1', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'phase III trial', 'predictive marker', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2020,168955,0.10490330432218567
"Identifying Healthy and High-Risk Weight Loss Phenotypes to Optimize Obesity Management in End Stage Kidney Disease Project Summary/Abstract  In 2016, 47,000 individuals who initiated dialysis in the United States (~42% of all incident dialysis patients that year) had obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kilograms per meters squared. Across the BMI spectrum, individuals with kidney disease commonly lose weight after initiating dialysis treatment. However, whereas body weight typically stabilizes after the first several months of dialysis among patients without obesity, those with obesity often continue to lose weight. Both people with and without obesity who are on dialysis may lose weight due to muscle wasting and malnutrition, and recent studies have identified weight loss as a risk factor for death among people on dialysis, independent of BMI. Yet, some of the weight loss observed among obese dialysis patients may also reflect deliberate attempts to improve health, mobility, or access to kidney transplantation. Currently, there are no guidelines to help clinicians to differentiate between healthy and high-risk weight loss among people with obesity on dialysis. Further, typical obesity management paradigms are not easily transferrable to obese people with end-stage kidney disease, given factors such as chronic malnutrition, inflammation, and sarcopenia in this population that may modify the risks and benefits of different weight loss strategies. Therefore, the overarching goal of this five-year research proposal is to define healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes among people with obesity who are on dialysis, and to provide clinically feasible tools to improve obesity management in the setting of end-stage kidney disease. We will accomplish this goal by conducting three distinct but interrelated studies. In the first study, we will qualitatively determine patient-prioritized endpoints of weight loss, in addition to patient, physician and other stakeholder perspectives on the key factors that differentiate healthy from high-risk weight loss on dialysis. In the second study, we will leverage a national dataset of 23,000 obese dialysis patients and apply constructs of high and low physiologic reserve to derive healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes. We will then develop a weight- loss risk calculator tool that predicts the risks of hospitalization and death that are associated with each weight loss phenotype, using dynamic predictive joint models and machine learning techniques. In the third study, we will enroll 250 obese dialysis patients in a prospective, longitudinal study across five regions in the United States to evaluate the association between nutritional, inflammatory, and hemodynamic biomarkers and measures of health trajectory that are not typically captured in registry data, such as sarcopenia, dynapenia, body composition, and patient-prioritized endpoints such as quality of life. In accomplishing its aims, this research will provide urgently needed knowledge and tools that will improve the medical management of tens of thousands of people with end-stage kidney disease and obesity, ensuring that clinicians will be better able to incorporate patient-prioritized outcomes into assessments of weight loss interventions, and recognize and mitigate the effects of high-risk weight loss. Project Narrative Although over 40,000 obese individuals with end-stage kidney disease initiate dialysis each year in the United States, there are no guidelines on optimal obesity management in the setting of dialysis care. Obese dialysis patients may lose weight due to chronic illness or due to intentional weight loss attempts, though it is difficult to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy weight loss in these patients. This proposal seeks to advance the science of obesity management in dialysis settings by providing new tools to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy weight loss trajectories among obese dialysis patients.",Identifying Healthy and High-Risk Weight Loss Phenotypes to Optimize Obesity Management in End Stage Kidney Disease,9943129,R01DK124388,"['Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dietitian', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intake', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Kilogram', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Muscle function', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Nephrology', 'Non obese', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Transplant Recipients', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'experience', 'hazard', 'health related quality of life', 'healthy weight', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'inflammatory marker', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meter', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obesity management', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'sleep quality', 'tool', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,301998,0.069753118902622
"Single Cell Analysis of Kidney Transplant Antibody Mediated Rejection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Kidney transplantation offers the greatest survival advantage to patients with end stage kidney disease and is vastly more cost effective than dialysis. Long-term survival of kidney transplants has not improved in recent decades. Antibody mediated rejection (AMR) has been identified as a major cause of transplant failure. Currently, management of patients with AMR is inconsistent among centers and frequently fails. We hypothesize that the cell types and cell states unique to AMR can be resolved by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of biopsy samples taken from patients at the time of diagnosis. This approach uses an unsupervised framework for dissecting transcriptional heterogeneity within complex tissues such as the kidney. This allows for the interrogation of cell states and subpopulations using an unbiased clustering approach that is independent of previous knowledge and can provide unprecedented resolution. To test our hypothesis we propose the following aims: In Aim 1, we will perform scRNA-seq of 40 research biopsy cores (20 AMR and 20 non-AMR). From this data we will identify genes expressed in endothelial cells and antibody secreting cells that define AMR specific phenotypes. We have demonstrated feasibility of this approach by generating single cell data from human biopsy samples as outlined in the research plan. For Aim 2, we will use immunohistochemistry to validate these AMR specific markers on a set of independent tissue samples. For Aim 3, we will use publicly available Affymetrix microarray datasets from kidney transplant biopsies with associated outcomes data to determine which cell types are associated with allograft outcome. This proposal logically builds on the principal investigator’s previous research experience and clinical training. To date he has been working full time in clinical transplantation and continuing his research endeavors on an ‘out of hours’ basis. Despite this his research output and experience continue to grow and he has recently published a report on the first successful application of this technology to human kidney biopsy tissue (co-first author). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills by attaining additional knowledge and practical research experience in single cell methods, bioinformatics and immunology. The career development goals will be achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentoring by Dr. Benjamin Humphreys and an advisory committee consisting of Drs. Barbara Murphy (transplant genomics), Phil Payne (biomedical informatics and translational science), Rob Mitra (single cell applications) and Paul Allen (translational immunology), didactic coursework, scientific investigation, and training in scientific communication and research ethics. This work will take place in Washington University which has a rich history of mentoring successful physician-scientists. Successful completion of this career development award will result in a better understanding of AMR, result in the principal investigator’s transition to an independent physician- scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for RO1-level funding.

"Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates 7. Project Summary This K23 proposal will provide Xingxing S. Cheng, MD, MS with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to become an independent clinical investigator. Dr. Cheng is a board-certified nephrologist and accredited transplant nephrologist, with a long-term vision of improving the effectiveness of health care for kidney transplant patients. She seeks to combine patient-oriented research and decision science to find innovative solutions to clinical problems. Skills she will acquire in this grant, under the guidance of a strong mentorship team, include 1) integration of patient-oriented research and decision analytic models; 2) assessing the heterogeneity of response in different patient subgroups; and 3) advanced modelling skills. This grant proposes to refine the process of screening of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease on the wait-list awaiting kidney transplantation. Currently, patients undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, few of which result in interventions. These tests impose a high treatment burden on patients and potentially delay time to transplant, while bringing unclear benefit to the patient. This grant proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients with diabetes mellitus). It will examine strategies that vary the frequency of cardiac testing and risk stratification for cardiac testing based on a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive test that can be performed in routine clinical settings, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). This project will achieve this broad aim by three specific aims: 1) to characterize the 6MWT in identifying low-risk patients who do not additional cardiac testing; 2) to model strategies varying the frequency of cardiac testing and use of 6MWT; 3) to design strategies personalized for specific patient subgroups and model them in the entire kidney transplant candidate population of the United States (US). The first two aims will arise from a well-characterized cohort of patients at Dr. Cheng’s institution. Machine-learning systems will be used to identify which patient subgroups are best served by which strategies (i.e. the heterogeneity of response). The third aim will leverage the US Renal Data System, which Dr. Cheng’s mentors and institution has a track record of leveraging for innovative research. The proposed work has high potential to make a significant clinical impact. Its completion will enable the identification and characterization of rational strategies for pre-transplant screening of coronary artery disease that may be incorporated into clinical practice or pave the way for a future multi-center comparative effectiveness trial. The proposed work is realistic and feasible within the award period, and will allow Dr. Cheng to build research skills, advance and disseminate scientific knowledge, create additional collaborative networks, and compete for R01 or equivalent funding. In summary, the K23 award will provide the support to enable Dr. Cheng to become a successful independent clinical investigator. 8. Project Narrative Currently, patients on the kidney transplant waitlist undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, but relatively few interventions result. This project proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients without diabetes mellitus), by examining strategies that reduce the frequency of cardiac testing and use performance-based risk stratification to reduce the number of patients who need cardiac testing.

"In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones OVERALL SUMMARY  The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and inefficient emergency department visits that typically include repetitive exposure to ionizing radiation from diagnostic imaging, and will significantly reduce the often lengthy (days to weeks) wait time patients must endure before procedures for stone removal can be scheduled and performed. As the proposed therapy system is entirely noninvasive, patients will be treated on an outpatient basis. Further, as the system is designed to efficiently and painlessly break stones of any size and expel the fragments from the kidney, the treatment of both symptomatic and asymptomatic stones using this technology will reduce the high retreatment and stone event recurrence rates associated with current surgical interventions for stone removal.  In this effort, we will combine stone breakage by burst wave lithotripsy (BWL), clearance of fragments by ultrasonic propulsion (UP), and stone-specific ultrasound imaging (S-mode) into an integrated system in which exposure strategies are adapted during treatment in response to real-time acoustic feedback to enhance comminution efficiency and patient safety. We will tailor treatment by investigating numerically and in lab tests the primary mechanisms - cavitation and elastic waves - involved in the comminution process over a broad parameter space. We will develop acoustics-based feedback including model- based, machine learning and passive acoustic mapping (PAM) of the bubble field to signal the need to adjust the energy output. We will investigate the morphological and functional response of the kidney in living animals and in ex vivo perfused porcine kidneys, and pursue tissue protective treatment strategies such as power ramping.  These studies will include the first in-human test of BWL in which we will compare the comminution effectiveness and safety of treatment with and without adaptive output control in response to acoustic feedback. In addition, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of the benefits and risks of fragmenting and expelling symptomatic and asymptomatic stones in the clinic. Toward application of the system for use in humans, we will refine and validate the use of UP and S-mode together to improve stone and fragment detection. With our eye on the future of stone management, we will develop and validate in vivo an extracorporeal acoustic tractor beam to grasp and carry fragments through the complex three- dimensional path of the urinary space and out of the kidney. OVERALL NARRATIVE Urinary stone disease, which affects 1 in 11 Americans, is one of the most painful diseases and also the costliest non-malignant urologic disease, because current management is limited to observation for the stone to pass or performing surgery. The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based, handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and temporizing emergency department visits and radiation exposing imaging while the patient waits in pain for days to weeks for the stone to pass or be surgically removed.","In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones",10005352,P01DK043881,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Bowman&apos', 's space', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lithotripsy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Non-Malignant', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Painless', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Publications', 'Radiation exposure', 'Ramp', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Tissue', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retreatment', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Wait Time', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'calcification', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'grasp', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individualized medicine', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'response', 'safety study', 'simulation', 'structured data', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P01,2020,1567293,0.06956834059916343
"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantification is crucial for clinical management of these children.

"Identification of Sub-phenotypes in Sepsis Associated Acute Kidney Injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in over 50% of patients with sepsis and is associated with increased risk of mortality and other complications, including longer hospital length of stay and the development or progression of chronic kidney disease. To date, therapies for sepsis associated AKI (SA-AKI) remain largely supportive. One possible reason for the failure of targeted therapies may be the currently limited understanding of the pathophysiology of the condition. Traditionally, SA-AKI has been thought to be largely due to renal ischemia secondary to hypoperfusion. However, animal models show that SA-AKI is actually a state characterized by hyperdynamic circulation, and review of histological changes in septic patients shows a lack of acute tubular necrosis, a pathological finding often associated with renal ischemia. Rather, it appears that a combination of immunologic, toxic and inflammatory factors likely leads to SA-AKI, and intervening along these pathways may improve patient outcomes for SA-AKI. We hypothesize that within a population with SA-AKI, there are subgroups who have particular inflammatory and immunological profiles that are associated with differential outcomes and response to therapies. In the fields of asthma and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, the use of clinical data and biomarkers to identify such subpopulations, or sub-phenotypes, of disease, has led to new treatment paradigms, where individuals with a specific biological profile receive and benefit from a targeted therapy. We propose to use data from a large, established cohort of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (the Early Assessment of Renal and Lung Injury [EARLI] cohort) to define sub-phenotypes of SA-AKI using latent class analysis. Latent class analysis is an established method that uses mixture models to identify sub- phenotypes within a heterogenous population in an unbiased manner. Prior work using this methodology has allowed for discovery of new disease entities that inform biological pathways of cellular injury leading to organ failure. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: To identify novel sub-phenotypes of patients with SA-AKI and discover molecular targets for therapy through the incorporation of clinical and biomarker data into our latent class analysis. Aim 2: To determine whether certain sub-phenotypes are associated with differential outcomes with regards to mortality, need for renal replacement therapy, or duration of AKI. Through the studies outlined in this F32 proposal, Dr. Kwong will learn how to rigorously conduct latent class analysis as well as other unbiased analytic techniques (e.g., machine learning) and to apply these techniques to AKI. This work will effectively position Dr. Kwong for her future research studies, where she wants to identify appropriate patients for clinical trials of AKI therapies and to better define the pathophysiology of human AKI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis has been shown to be a key contributing factor for the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). To date, there are no available targeted therapies for sepsis-associated AKI besides supportive care with antibiotics and fluids. The long-term goal of this project is to find new therapeutics for sepsis-associated AKI by first identifying sub-phenotypes based on clinical and biomarker profiles that may inform the molecular pathways of injury and then determining their association with adverse outcomes.",Identification of Sub-phenotypes in Sepsis Associated Acute Kidney Injury,9833437,F32DK118870,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Acute Kidney Tubular Necrosis', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Allergic', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Apoptotic', 'Aspirin', 'Asthma', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Electrolyte Balance', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Failure', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Fluid Balance', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Oliguria', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary to', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Urine', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cell injury', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'hypoperfusion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lung injury', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'renal ischemia', 'research study', 'response', 'septic patients', 'targeted treatment', 'tubular necrosis']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2020,81571,-0.03218054047187233
"Identifying Resident and Immune Cell Injury Responses in the Human Kidney Kidney function, both under normal conditions and in the setting of injury or disease, is predominantly controlled by the amount, localization and activation state of proteins in specific cells at specific sites and under specific spatial influences that in turn regulate cell differentiation, division, metabolism, morphology, membrane polarization, secretion and transport. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) takes advantage of laser ionization and time of flight mass spectrometry to simultaneously identify >40 metal ion-conjugated antibodies from tissue sections at 1micron resolution with essentially no background signal. By mixing cell specific antibodies and activation state-specific antibodies in the same cocktail, IMC produces a spatially preserved analysis of the location and activation state of multiple cell types from the same tissue section. We have developed a panel of 21 antibodies for simultaneous kidney section hybridization and IMC analysis, and a machine-learning based analysis pipeline that has allowed us to provide the first quantitative atlas of the number and location of the tubular, endothelial, glomerular and interstitial cells in the normal human kidney (Singh et al., JCI-Insight, in press). We now propose to validate an additional 22-29 antibodies for an expansion of this panel so as to provide information on the immune activation state and resident epithelial and endothelial cell injury, survival and death pathway responses predicted to be important in the injured human kidney. We will first perform in vitro validation of antibodies that detect cell injury/dedifferentiation states, survival pathways (autophagy, unfolded protein response, proliferation), and cell death/senescence pathways (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, senescence, Specific Aim 1), as well as immune cell populations and their activation states (Specific Aim 2). We will then perform IMC/Kidney-MAPPS based validation of the composite panel using carefully characterized human kidney biopsies from patients with defined clinical insults and morphologically quantified tubular and endothelial injury (Specific Aim 3). The end product of this proposal will be to provide a validated set of antibodies that can be used to accurately quantify cell injury states and subsequent responses across a spectrum of human kidney diseases. These antibodies can then be used by investigators who perform multiplexed imaging of the kidney, including IMC, IONpath MIBI cytometry, Tissue Cytometry and Repeated Fluorescent Imaging to mechanistically interrogate human AKI. Acute Kidney Injury is an important cause of in-hospital morbidity and mortality. While we have a great understanding of the biological events in animal models of kidney injury, we have much less understanding of the events that cause human kidney Injury. This proposal is designed to develop the resources needed to study human kidney injury and thus inform better clinical trials of treatments to both prevent kidney injury and improve recovery.",Identifying Resident and Immune Cell Injury Responses in the Human Kidney,9954680,R21AG067335,"['Ablation', 'Acute', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Activation', 'Apoptosis', 'Atlases', 'Autophagocytosis', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Crystallization', 'Cytometry', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Development', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Female', 'Formalin', 'Grant', 'Heavy Metals', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Interstitial Nephritis', 'Intervention', 'Ions', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nephrectomy', 'Paraffin', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Tissues', 'Tubular formation', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'analysis pipeline', 'antibody conjugate', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical referral center', 'cell injury', 'cell type', 'clinical diagnostics', 'design', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'eosinophil', 'fluorescence imaging', 'human imaging', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'injured', 'insight', 'interstitial cell', 'ionization', 'ischemic injury', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney cell', 'kidney imaging', 'living kidney donor', 'macrophage', 'male', 'mast cell', 'mortality', 'multiplexed imaging', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenome', 'predicting response', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'quantum', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'response to injury', 'screening', 'senescence', 'time of flight mass spectrometry', 'tumor']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,251250,0.1274027405711989
"Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States over 500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in ~20% of cardiac surgical patients. Several cohort and registry studies have reported that AKI defined by rise in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery associates with development of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events. However, it is unclear which patients will develop long-term adverse kidney events, adverse cardiovascular events, or both. In recent years blood and urine AKI biomarkers have been identified that reflect different aspects of AKI biology and that detect serum creatinine defined AKI earlier than rise in serum creatinine or detect subclinical AKI that is not revealed by traditional serum creatinine assessment. Clinical outcomes and biomarker research has focused mainly on detecting cardiac surgery- associated AKI itself, but not on predicting which patients are at greatest risk for long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after AKI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that perioperative blood and urine AKI biomarkers significantly associate with increased long-term (2 to 5 years) postoperative major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). MAKE is defined as the composite of dialysis, death, renal hospitalization, or ≥ 30 day postoperative eGFR decline >25% from preoperative baseline. MACE is defined as the composite of death or hospitalizations for heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, arrhythmia, or stroke. We propose a prospective observational cohort study of 610 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years following cardiac surgery. Based on preliminary data we will assess plasma NT-pro- B-type natriuretic peptide, plasma intact fibroblast growth factor 23, serum cystatin C, urine TIMP-2*IGFBP7, and urine Kidney Injury Molecule-1 AKI biomarkers preoperatively and at 5 postoperative time points. This proposal will address three specific aims: 1) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MAKE during long-term follow-up; 2) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MACE during long-term follow-up; and 3) To develop clinical prediction models for long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. In addition to traditional regression modeling, we will use machine learning that leverages detailed perioperative data including time-varying intraoperative and intensive care unit clinical data and blood and urine AKI biomarker data to create high performing prediction models. Our proposal is significant because knowing what blood and urine AKI biomarkers and clinical parameters accurately predict long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after cardiac surgery provides the foundation for clinical trials that will identify effective short and long-term interventions for patients at highest risk. Our proposal is innovative because clinical and biomarker data has not been leveraged in this way to predict long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because combining blood and urine acute kidney injury biomarkers and clinical data to identify cardiac surgical patients at highest risk for long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes will allow interventional studies to better individualize clinical management to prevent these outcomes. While acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is associated with increased long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (~25% incidence), it remains unclear which patients with postoperative acute kidney injury are at highest risk. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that can be applied to enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing illness and disability.",Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery,9930135,R01HL148448,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Anesthesiology', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Applications Grants', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain natriuretic peptide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Science', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Foxes', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nephrology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasma', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Transfusion', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'health record', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'post gamma-globulins', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rat KIM-1 protein']",NHLBI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,797215,0.1105766817456193
"Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), resulting from drug exposure, infection or autoimmune disease, is the cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in up to 20% of patients who undergo a kidney biopsy. Even though we currently have 2 clinical interventions available to treat patients with AIN (withdrawal of the offending drug and corticosteroids), 40-60% of patients with AIN go on to develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) even when appropriately treated. Kidney damage in AIN is believed to result from immune-mediated tubular injury that eventually leads to fibrosis and permanent kidney damage.  The recent dileniation of the immune underpinnings of multiple autoimmune diseases and cancers has led to the development of targeted therapies that exhibit improved efficacy and less toxicity compared to corticosteroids. Therefore, an analysis of the immune infiltrate and resulting resident cell (tubular and vascular) responses that provides pathogenic understanding of the specific immune events that initiate and propogate AIN should lead to development and/or repurposing of targeted therapies that are more effective at resolving AIN and preventing the progression to CKD, as well as potentially less toxic.  Data from several groups, including our own, suggest that CD4+ T-helper cells (particularly the TH2/TH9 subsets) are potential drivers of AIN. We have found that TH2/TH9 cytokines IL-5 and IL-9 and some cells of type 2 immunity, mast cells and eosinophils, are higher in the urine or kidneys of patients with AIN. Based on these data, it is our hypothesis that TH2/TH9 T-helper cells in the kidney itself play an important pathogenic role in promoting tubular or vascular injury in AIN. We will test this hypothesis by performing a quantitative evaluation of the kidney immune infiltrate and accompanying tubular and vascular response in humans with AIN. We will use existing kidney biopsies, adjudicated by 3 nephropathologists as exhibiting AIN, from two university health centers (Yale and Johns Hopkins), as discovery and validation cohorts for this study. To perform the quantitative analysis we will use an imaging technique called Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) that supports the simultaneous, spatially-preserved quantification of up to 42 antibodies on a single tissue section. We have an existing library of 27 validated kidney and immune antibodies and have developed a machine learning protocol to rapidly and accurately quantify and localize all cells in the human kidney identified using IMC.  We will first increase our validated antibody panel and optimize our IMC protocol for use in the study of AIN (SA 1). We will then use IMC to identify, quantify and localize the immune and resident cell responses in 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN control biopsies from Yale (discovery cohort), followed by 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN controls from JHU (validation cohort, SA 2). Finally, we will define the relationship between cellular determinants of AIN and recovery of kidney function as well as response to steroids (SA3). Our findings will not only lead to identification of novel druggable targets in AIN, but also lead to improving clinical histological diagnosis of AIN. Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN) is an important cause of kidney dysfunction, and can lead to chronic kidney disease in many patients. We know that AIN occurs as an immune response in the kidney to certain drugs or infections, but do not have a clear understanding of the cell sources of the inflammation or the tubular and vascular responses. This proposal is designed to define these immune events in human kidney biopsy samples left over after clinical diagnosis has been completed, and to determine how they relate to the development of chronic kidney disease.",Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis,10096452,R01DK126815,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Archives', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Delayed Hypersensitivity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Fibrosis', 'Formalin', 'Health', 'Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-5', 'Interleukin-9', 'Interstitial Nephritis', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Neighborhoods', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Renal function', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Steroids', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Preservation', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Tubular formation', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Withdrawal', 'adjudicate', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'eosinophil', 'exhaust', 'improved', 'injured', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney dysfunction', 'mast cell', 'multiphoton imaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'renal damage', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'vascular injury']",NIDDK,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,564483,0.19608089455975736
"Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records Project Summary A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate, Dr.Ozrazgat Baslanti, with the necessary protected time and additional training and resources to develop her skillset on quantitative methods and understanding of underlying mechanism of progression of kidney disease and facilitate her transition to an independent translational researcher in health care. The long-term career goal is to become an independent data scientist, with a focus on hospital care for acute disease and complications arising from that care. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of the analytical approach for identifying patients’ health trajectories during episode of acute hospitalization and quantifying the transitions in health states that can be applied to any acute illness. Our central hypothesis is that using kidney health as a paradigm for this approach we can determine individual states of change in kidney health during hospitalization using longitudinal, highly granular temporal data in electronic health records, determine transition probabilities to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease, and improve understanding of the underlying processes influencing these transitions. Current diagnosis and risk evaluation for acute kidney injury (AKI) are focused on determination of severity of AKI episode and an integrated framework for assessing renal recovery does not exist. There is a clear lack of research on estimating transition probabilities among different states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using longitudinal electronic health records data. The complexity of underlying processes influencing the transition probabilities from renal risk to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease requires application of advanced computational models in sufficiently large and granular datasets. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1- Expand and validate computable phenotypes of kidney health in large-scale medical data. Aim 2- Determine the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of changes in kidney health. Aim 3- Develop and validate probabilistic graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health and identify risk factors for progression. The proposed research is significant as we will have phenotyping algorithms of kidney health, validated in multi-center study, that can enhance their inter-institutional sharing and that enable to study epidemiology and outcomes of changes in kidney health. The approach is innovative because it implements technological advances in data science and statistics in innovative steps to develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm that determines computable phenotypes of changes in kidney health and graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using highly granular electronic health records. This will provide foundation for changes in the care of patients with AKI, through identification of those patients at risk of developing AKI and progressing to acute and chronic kidney disease. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and a diagnosis and prognostication tool for kidney health. Project Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complication among hospitalized patients and is central to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and increased mortality. Besides the severity of an initial episode of acute kidney injury, the timing and duration of renal recovery are required to characterize the natural history of this complex condition and its effect on overall kidney health. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health, since our research may provide diagnosis and prediction tools for changes in kidney health using electronic records data that contain wealth of clinical data that could be used to identify all dimensions of AKI episode as well as key determinants of undesired outcomes.",Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records,9891542,K01DK120784,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Network', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Preventive therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adjudication', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'computable phenotypes', 'data warehouse', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prognostic tool', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2020,130488,0.22484716963088647
"Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus Abstract Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current clinical laboratory markers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to optimize individual patient care creating a need to develop novel biomarkers for LN. To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,9925731,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2020,653985,0.07582722302831157
"Accurate quantification of kidney function with non-sedated motion-compensated pediatric MRI Project Summary: Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is an impairment of urine flow from the renal pelvis into the proximal ureter and is the most common cause of hydronephrosis in neonates. This disorder is detected in up to 7% of all maternal ultrasound scans, and an estimated 10% of these newborns have hydronephrosis, which, if left untreated, may result in early failure of functional renal development in these patients. Current methods of assessing kidney function in neonates and children are less than optimal, however. While the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3), yields some useful diagnostic information; it is invasive, slow, provides low resolution, does not offer anatomic detail, and delivers potentially harmful ionizing radiation. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need to develop a method for functional imaging of kidneys that is non-invasive, safe, accurate, reproducible and radiation-free. The primary objective of this exploratory, two-year study, therefore, is two-fold: first, to develop advanced methods of motion-compensated, high spatial and temporal resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the improved quantification of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), an important marker of renal function; and second, to demonstrate the superiority of this method over the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3). Our application in response to PAR-18-743 is specifically aimed at developing, and evaluating motion-robust, high spatiotemporal resolution dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) for quantifying GFR (MR-GFR) as well as creating new automated analysis software to enable the robust and reproducible assessment of differential renal function in newborns eliminating need for sedation, and in older children. Our method will overcome the technical challenges of current DCE-MRI techniques providing high temporal resolution to capture fast arterial input function dynamics required for accurate computation of GFR, compensate for unavoidable respiratory and bulk motion to reconstruct high quality images and will provide robust, fast, automated post processing techniques for accurate GFR computation. As a non-invasive, motion-robust, radiation-free imaging technique that can depict renal structures at much higher resolution, MR-GFR will offer, for the first time, a level of diagnostic information that is unattainable with MAG3. The critical importance of understanding the extent and severity of UPJO (and resulting hydronephrosis) cannot be understated; for in the absence of this information, children who stand to benefit from immediate surgery might be overlooked or delayed in receiving treatment; and those who might benefit from a more conservative approach (i.e., watching waiting) might receive an unnecessary surgical intervention. Indeed, this novel imaging approach is expected to substantially improve clinical decision-making. The successful completion of our aims will enable 1) assessment of renal function accurately; 2) predicting the likelihood of functional decline; and 3) determining whether surgery is indicated. DCE-MRI is expected to have rapid translational impact for several diseases effecting kidney function once it is introduced into clinical practice. Project Narrative: This project addresses the need to develop advanced methods of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess kidney function in newborns and in older children who have been diagnosed with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), an impairment of urine flow that is the most common cause of hydronephrosis (inability to void urine). Unfortunately, severe hydronephrosis, left untreated, can result in permanent damage to the child's kidneys and our novel method of assessing kidney function, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), promises to evaluate the extent of this disorder in a way that is highly accurate, non- invasive, safe, reliable, and radiation-free and will eliminate the need of repeated scans, sedation and anesthesia when imaging newborns with congenital hydronephrosis. Most importantly, this approach will enable the clinician to confidently and quickly refer children for corrective surgery based on imaging results; and likewise, recommend other children for more conservative “watchful-waiting”, effectively reducing the number of unnecessary surgeries.",Accurate quantification of kidney function with non-sedated motion-compensated pediatric MRI,9877232,R21DK123569,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age-Months', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drainage procedure', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Free Will', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gadolinium', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Hospitalization', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Infection', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Liquid substance', 'Lower urinary tract', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Nephrectomy', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nuclear', 'Obstruction', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pain', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pentetic Acid', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reference Standards', 'Renal function', 'Renal pelvis', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sedation procedure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Ureter', 'Ureteropelvic junction obstruction', 'Urine', 'Urology', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'care costs', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep neural network', 'functional decline', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney imaging', 'kinetic model', 'neonate', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'renal artery', 'respiratory', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'translational impact', 'urologic']",NIDDK,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,221250,0.08652431022866595
"Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization Project Summary: Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization A recent White House initiative titled Advancing American Kidney Health outlines the current administration's plans to increase the supply of kidneys in the US, along with other measures that attempt to correct the imbalance between supply and demand for kidneys. In alignment with this White House initiative, the principal investigator (PI) of this project will develop algorithms to assist Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) make donor disposition decisions with the goal of increasing the supply of transplantable organs. The PI will harness the vast amount of data collected by OPOs, and customize as well as develop new Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify good donors. These algorithms will reduce case coordinators workload and improve the accuracy of their decisions. The PI's objective is to quantity the impact of AI-assisted decision-making on increasing the supply of kidneys by ﬁnding missed opportunities on account of the current manual processes. Even a few more potential donors per OPO will help reduce the organ shortage problem when scaled to all 58 OPOs across the country.  This project will leverage unique data sets to generate and test hypotheses concerning which fac- tors aﬀect donor disposition decisions, and which information processing protocols produce greater referral-to-donor conversion rate. It will also customize classiﬁcation algorithms to assist case co- ordinators make donor disposition decisions. The focus will be on improving both the accuracy and speed of such decisions. As a follow up of this project, the PI will conduct a broader study involving at least ﬁve additional OPOs. The ﬁve OPOs will be selected to represent the diversity in size, population, and geography among the 58 OPOs across the country. Results of this and the follow-up study will be shared freely with all OPOs. The proposed research has the potential to increase the number of donors, free up staﬀ time, and lower OPO labor costs.  The potential impact of this project lies in the formulation and testing of hypotheses that can beneﬁt OPO decision-making and people on transplant wait list, customization of existing machine learning algorithms and computational techniques for sequential decision-making in a novel setting, and laying the groundwork for the development of new methods in the future.  The PI has the necessary disciplinary expertise, and management and leadership experience to succeed in the proposed eﬀorts. He has access to advanced computing resources and administrative help from the University of Texas. Finally, he has obtained the necessary IRB approval to proceed with this project. 1 Project Narrative: Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization The widespread use of electronic medical record systems by hospitals, and electronic capture of referrals data by the organ procurement organizations (OPOs) makes it possible to harness large amounts of data to augment human decision-making and ask whether this can increase the supply of organs, speciﬁcally kidneys. The PI in this project will focus on improving the speed and accuracy of case coordinators' donor-disposition decisions by developing and testing customized machine learning and sequential decision-making algorithms using data from two OPOs. These eﬀorts will help quantify the potential beneﬁt of leveraging OPO data to increase kidney supply and pave the way for a larger study focusing on multiple OPOs.",Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization,10042096,R03HS027671,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2020,41981,0.09033059575244676
"Anatomic biomarkers of chronic kidney disease progression among children Progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in childhood is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic bone disease, and death. Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), including posterior urethral valves, account for 50-60% of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children and are the most common cause of ESRD in this age group. In children with CAKUT, kidney injury is often already established at birth due to renal dysplasia. Some children, however, maintain preserved kidney function into adulthood while others progress to ESRD in childhood. Our ability to effectively implement therapies to slow CKD progression is limited by our lack of understanding of which patients are at greatest risk for CKD progression and therefore would be most likely to benefit from early intervention. Thus there is a need for biomarkers that can identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression. To identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression, we will develop novel computational methods to derive clinically informative biomarkers from ultrasound (US) imaging data using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and effectively integrate them with established clinical measures for early prediction of CKD progression. To achieve reliable and accurate kidney segmentation, Aim 1 develops an automatic kidney segmentation method by adopting fully CNNs, conditional random fields, and active contour models to simultaneously learn informative high-level image features and inter-voxel relationship under shape regularizations to improve the segmentation accuracy and robustness to imaging noise. To achieve improved prediction of CDK progression based on US imaging data, deep CNNs will be adopted to learn informative imaging features in a multi-instance learning framework to predict which children with CAKUT will develop CKD progression and their timing of progression in Aim 2. These techniques will be applied to a dataset of patients followed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, in order to derive individualized predictive indices of CKD progression. The proposed new techniques will allow us to early differentiate patients with distinct disease progression patterns.

"Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups ABSTRACT Although patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) present with shared clinical signs and symptoms (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema), there is dramatic variability in prognosis and response to therapy, frustrating patients, families and their clinicians. Even within the histopathologic categories used in the current diagnostic approach (e.g. minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), there is dramatic variability in disease progression and response to therapy, highlighting the underlying biological heterogeneity within the groups. Small studies with broad, clinical patient inclusion criteria have demonstrated that a subset of patients respond well to anti-TNF therapy, but accurate pre-treatment response of those individuals is not possible based on routine clinical parameters. This project will leverage the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort study, a multi-center prospective study of 600 patients with FSGS, MCD and MN with rich clinical data, kidney biopsy tissue and gene expression profiles. This study will leverage the kidney tissue gene expression data to identify a subgroup of patients with TNF-alpha pathway activation, assess associated clinical outcomes and identify non- molecular predictors of the subgroup. The aims are:  Aim 1: To identify a subgroup of Nephrotic Syndrome patients with homogeneous activation of the  TNF-alpha transcriptional pathway.  Aim 2: To compare molecular subgroups with conventional clinical-pathologic classification in  clinical outcome prediction.  Aim 3: To identify non-invasive markers (e.g. demographics, blood and urine markers), standard  pathology features and novel pathologic biopsy descriptors associated with the TNF-alpha subgroup. To accomplish this project, the applicant will pursue formal training in systems biology, genetic epidemiology and bioinformatics. She will be mentored by a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in systems biology, epidemiology and bioinformatics. The long term objective is to improve the clinical care of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome by improved understanding of the underlying biology, identifying novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for future validation in animal models and mechanistic-based interventional clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nephrotic Syndrome, caused by several rare kidney diseases, is characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, swelling and kidney failure. Patients affected by the syndrome suffer complications of the disease as well as the toxicity of the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat it, but their individual presentations, response to treatment and prognosis can vary markedly. This project aims to use gene expression levels from kidney biopsy tissue to identify the subgroup patients most likely to respond to TNF- alpha blocking medications, an approach which, if validated, may help to inform targeted therapy selections for these patients.",Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups,9926246,K08DK115891,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Edema', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Membranous Glomerulonephritis', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Publications', 'Renal glomerular disease', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Swelling', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'biological systems', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'kidney biopsy', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'predict clinical outcome', 'response', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2020,169560,0.11558879526888444
"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Total kidney volume (TKV) has become the main image-based biomarker for following ADPKD progression. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming and costly. This project will develop automated tools to increase measurement throughput, and explore new image-based biomarkers that will significantly add to the assessment of patient prognosis, and will have the ability to more quickly judge the effectiveness of interventions.",Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD,10011565,K01DK110136,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Consumption', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'FarGo', 'Fibrosis', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrology', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Tissue', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Spin Labels', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Writing', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'educational atmosphere', 'functional decline', 'human model', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'kidney vascular structure', 'knowledge base', 'novel imaging technology', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'prognostic value', 'radiological imaging', 'renal artery', 'research study', 'shear stress', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K01,2020,154915,0.07020329118204091
