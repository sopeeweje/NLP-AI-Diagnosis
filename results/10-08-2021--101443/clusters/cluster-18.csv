"Protein structure determination from low-resolution experimental data Project Abstract Determination of a protein’s three-dimensional structure is of critical importance in biology, providing insights to biological mechanisms and important targets for drug design. While high- resolution X-ray diffraction data provides an atomic view of cellular components, for many interesting and biologically relevant complexes, it may only be possible to obtain low-resolution structural information. Both cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, when applied to large, flexible molecular machines, often produce data of 3-6 Å resolution. Extracting detailed atomic information from this data, critical in understanding function, the effects of mutation, or in designing drugs is impossible due to the low number of observations and the large conformational space proteins may adopt. I propose to develop computational methods for extracting high-resolution atomic models from this low-resolution data, bridging the “resolution gap” with computational methods. My proposed research develops and extends our labs’ methods for automatically inferring atomic accuracy models, from these “near-atomic” resolution sources of experimental data. We develop novel conformational sampling methods, guided by experimental data, to infer atomic information both in cases where homologous high-resolution data is available, and where it is not. Additionally, we propose development of methods for estimating model uncertainty; these are critical in understanding to what degree structural conclusions may be made from a particular dataset. Finally, in pushing the resolution limit further, we develop general tools for biomolecular forcefield optimization. These machine-learning tools will allow development of a next-generation forcefield, critical in extending the resolution limit of data from which we can infer atomic details. The overall goal of the proposed research is robust and accessible methods to determine protein structures to atomic accuracy from only sparse experimental data. Combined, the three aims in this proposal will lead to dramatic improvements in our ability to infer atomic interactions from sparse experimental data. This will lead to determination of structures that will reveal key insights into how biomedically important protein complexes perform their function and what goes wrong in human disease.

"Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes Despite rapid progress in structural bioinformatics, a rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical framework is missing in our current toolbox for analysis, classification, and organization of individual as well as groups of biomolecules. We have recently developed such a framework based on the elastic shape analysis (ESA) for the comparison of protein and RNA structures. Under this framework, the formal geodesic distance for any two protein/RNA structures can be computed rapidly. Probability distributions can also be built for families of protein/RNA structures, and can be used to classify structures in a principled way through statistical hypothesis testing. In addition, sequence information can be naturally incorporated so that comparison of structures can be conducted in the joint sequence-structure space. We have also developed novel algorithms for matching and analyzing protein surfaces. We propose to significantly further develop these methodologies for important applications in structure biology, including studying chromosome structures by combining both 30 structure and sequence level information. The proposed research will make significant contributions to the following areas: (1) This proposal will fill an important gap in structure biology - the lack of a rigorous mathematical and statistical framework for biomolecular structure comparison; (2) Our proposed unifying framework will allow natural incorporation of sequence information for structure comparison; (3) Our approach can uncover distinct clusters at the deepest level of current classification scheme (i.e. SCOP family), enabling a finer classification of biomolecular structures. Preliminary results indicate that by using carefully measured structural similarity, we will obtain representative sets of proteins of higher quality than those by current sequence similarity based methods; (4) The probabilistic models designed for protein/RNA backbone structures and surfaces will capture the flexible nature of protein structures through the use of ensemble of conformations, while maintaining high computational efficiency. These models will also enable effective characterization of family-specific variations among proteins, an important task none of the existing methods work well; (5) Protein/RNA structures will be organized using network-based data structures using probabilistic approaches. This new organization will effectively integrates sequence, backbone structure, and surface information, facilitating discovery of novel insight; and (6) these new development will be rapidly generalized for studying chromosome structures. This proposed research will allow development of tools that will also be applicable in other areas of shape analysis, including medical image analysis, computer vision, and pattern recognition. Our work will help to increase the communication between the field of protein structure analysis and the field of shape analysis, and will stimulate more cross-over development in methodology and transform research activities in both fields. Analysis, classification and organization of biomolecules are fundamental tasks essential for understanding the sequence-structure-function relationships of biomolecules.

"MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is to develop MELD, a computational Bayesian accelerator that “melds” together molecular dynamics simulations with external knowledge. It is novel in harnessing information that has not been usable before – because it is too sparse, noisy, ambiguous, combinatoric, or too corrupted for traditional approaches. In contrast to the high-certainty restraints traditionally used in MD simulations, MELD leverages a much broader range of real-world high-uncertainty restraints. The first specific aim is to incorporate such information in protein structure determination, in several collaboration projects with experimentalists who perform solution x-ray scattering, ESR, and high-throughput alanine scanning structures of peptide protein complexes. The second aim is to also harness information about processes, trajectories, and dynamic routes to speed the identification of protein states. MELD promises to extend physics-based simulations for determining larger protein structures, for folding larger proteins, for binding more flexible ligands, and for exploring larger mechanistic actions, than current MD simulation methods can handle. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biomedical research and pharmaceutics depend on detailed understanding of the structures and motions of proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations provide the most detailed descriptions possible, however they cannot yet describe average to large sized protein structures or motions within a reasonable time frame. We propose to develop a new physics-based computational accelerator for Molecular Dynamics, called MELD, which incorporates many types of relevant external information that was too vague and difficult to compute to have been practically useful before.",MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference,9618886,R01GM125813,"['Affinity', 'Alanine', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Pharmacy (field)', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Virginia', 'base', 'blind', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'peptide structure', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'scale up', 'simulation']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2019,317007,0.13679261379419608
"High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important condensed phase probes of composition, structure and dynamics of biomolecules and bio-organic species. NMR observables such as chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings can be measured to very high accuracy, and are sensitive both to the functional groups that are present and to their detailed geometries and chemical environment. As such these NMR measurements could be used to develop protein structures with a quality equivalent to high resolution X-ray crystallography but in their native aqueous environments. The connection to structure, while true in principle, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to reveal in practice through direct assignment of the spectrum. Simulation methods that accurately predict spectral observables from structure are a key goal for spectral assignment. Such methods are even more crucial for the inverse problem of realizing high quality NMR structures of folded proteins from spectra, and as powerful restraints for determining the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Existing approaches to this problem typically rely on semi-empirical heuristics, and while they have achieved considerable success, they also reveal limitations that significantly degrade the quality of structural prediction. In this proposal, we will develop a new, first principles quantum mechanical (QM) based approach to simulation of NMR spectral observables for condensed phase biomolecules and bio-organics. Rapid prototyping of new QM methods will be enabled by the development of a distinctive in-silico NMR laboratory that applies finite magnetic fields and nuclear spins. From this capability, new methods for chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings will emerge that offer improved accuracy versus cost tradeoffs, and will be employed to populate databases that reflect protein relevant and energetically accessible environments. With such data, both artificial neural networks and Bayesian supervised learning approaches will determine a quantitative relationship between structure and computed NMR observable, and the resulting eQMCalculator will be tested on the refinement of folded proteins and creation of structural ensembles for IDPs. Project Title: High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy NMR shifts and splitting measurements for organic materials containing 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei can provide detailed descriptions of the structure of drug molecules, folded proteins and their complexes, as well as the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). However there are currently limitations of turning accurate NMR measurements into accurate structures that clearly hampers advances that could be made on connecting structure to function of proteins in their native aqueous environments. This proposal aims to significantly improve the ability to predict the chemical shifts and indirect spin-spin couplings to yield the spectrum associated with a given folded structure or IDP ensemble of structures, with very high accuracy, and with good computational efficiency.",High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,9633923,U01GM121667,"['Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Magnetism', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Phase', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Quantum Theory', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Solvents', 'Statistical Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'aqueous', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cost', 'database structure', 'drug structure', 'experimental study', 'functional group', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'magnetic field', 'personalized approach', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'response', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'vibration']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,U01,2019,294912,0.12351118538868323
"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Accurate description of protein structure and interactions is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics and drugs. However, there is a large gap between the number of available protein sequences and the number of proteins (complexes) with solved structures and accurate interaction description, which has to be filled by computational prediction. The long-term goal of this project is to apply statistical machine learning and optimization algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship by analyzing low- and high-throughput sequence, structure and functional data and to develop algorithms for structure and functional prediction. Our hypothesis is that by developing sophisticated algorithms to take advantage of the growing sequence and structure data, we can model sequence-structure relationship much more accurately and significantly improve structure and functional prediction, in particular for this proposal, residue (atomic) interaction strength prediction and remote homology detection. This project has produced a few CASP-winning, widely-used data-driven algorithms and web server (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) for monomer protein modeling. This renewal will not only further develop machine learning algorithms (especially Deep Learning and probabilistic graphical models) for monomer proteins, but also branch out to protein interactions (complexes). The specific aims are: (1) develop novel structure learning algorithms to predict inter-reside contacts and coevolved residues; (2) develop context-specific, coevolution-based, and distance-dependent statistical potentials using a new machine learning model called Deep Conditional (Markov) Neural Fields (DeepCNF); (3) develop Markov Random Fields (MRF) and DeepCNF methods for remote protein (interface/complex) homology detection and fold recognition to make use of long-range residue interaction predicted by the first two aims. This renewal will lead to further understanding and new models of protein sequence-structure-function relationship and yield publicly available software and servers for automated, accurate, quantitative analysis for a wide range of proteins and their interactions. The impact will be multiplied by tens of thousands of worldwide users employing the resulting software/servers to study a wide variety of proteins and interactions relevant to basic biological research and human diseases, in both low- and high-throughput experiments. Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. This proposal develops algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship and to predict protein structures and interactions.

"Integrated Prediction and Validation of Protein Structures ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of three-dimensional protein structure is indispensable in biomedical research. Protein structure and function are intimately linked, and thus structure facilitates drug discovery, aids investigations of protein-protein interactions, informs mutagenesis analysis, guides protein engineering and the design of new proteins, and provides a foundation for understanding the molecular basis of disease. However, the number of protein sequences available in the genomic era far exceeds the capacity of the main experimental structure determination techniques of X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, resulting in a substantial sequence- structure gap. We address this ever-widening gap by developing and disseminating novel protein structure modeling tools. This renewal project is a new collaboration between experts in computational modeling (Cheng) and experimental structural biology (Tanner). We plan to develop innovative, integrated machine learning (e.g., deep learning), data mining and statistical modeling methods to address major challenges in both template-based structure modeling and template-free (ab initio) structure modeling. We will apply these tools to enzymes in the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily, a group of enzymes that are involved in numerous important biological processes and implicated in many diseases due to mutations. The ALDH models will be experimentally validated using X-ray crystallography and biochemical assays. Furthermore, we will combine the modeling power of our structural Input-Output hidden Markov model with experimental small- angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to predict the tertiary structures of large multi-domain proteins. The integration of computational and experimental sciences in this project positions us uniquely in structure modeling space.

"Computational Design of Crystal Lattice Interactions to Determine Recalcitrant Protein Structures PROJECT SUMMARY Proteins are macromolecules that carry out innumerable biological functions ranging from intracellular signaling to immune response. The specific function of a protein is determined by its three-dimensional structure. Therefore, an essential step towards understanding protein function is elucidating protein structure. However, the premier method for structure determination, X-ray crystallography, can be limited by many potential factors including the quality of the protein crystal. The proposed research will investigate the effects of protein– protein interactions in the crystal lattice on crystal quality and resolution and develop a design approach to stabilize lattice interactions, which should result in higher-quality crystals.  First, the molecular determinants of high-quality protein crystal structures will be identified by (1) curating a set of representative structures from the Protein Data Bank, (2) extracting relevant features, such as interaction energy, buried solvent accessible surface area, interfacial packing quality, and residue usage, and (3) analyzing the features’ relationship to crystal resolution (a proxy for quality). Based on these findings, a design strategy and score function for ranking designs within the Rosetta framework will be developed.  Second, the design strategy will be applied to SNase, a model protein that is easy to purify and well- behaved in crystallization and diffraction experiments. The designed proteins will be crystallized and the crystal structures will be solved, testing for improved resolution. Analysis of the resultant crystal structures will drive development of the design strategy.  Third, the design strategy will be applied on a bacterial gyrase, an antibiotic-target protein for which there are several drug-bound structures at low resolution, lacking sufficient detail to reveal key antibiotic– gyrase interactions. Preliminary data suggests that the designed gyrase mutants will yield high-resolution structures, permitting a better understanding of antibiotic–gyrase interactions, with implications for drug design.  Should the method be successful, it will be immediately applicable to ~26,000 structures in the Protein Data Bank, and countless structures that have not been published due to lack of resolution. Re-engineered, high-resolution structures of these proteins could yield structural data on molecular interactions pertinent to disease, drug development, and basic understanding of protein function. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop methods to improve low-resolution crystal structures of proteins to high-resolution sufficient (1) to resolve key mechanistic features of enzyme function and disease, and (2) to design or screen drug molecules.

The proposed research will make significant contributions to the following areas: (1) This proposal will fill an important gap in structure biology - the lack of a rigorous mathematical and statistical framework for biomolecular structure comparison; (2) Our proposed unifying framework will allow natural incorporation of sequence information for structure comparison; (3) Our approach can uncover distinct clusters at the deepest level of current classification scheme (i.e. SCOP family), enabling a finer classification of biomolecular structures. Preliminary results indicate that by using carefully measured structural similarity, we will obtain representative sets of proteins of higher quality than those by current sequence similarity based methods; (4) The probabilistic models designed for protein/RNA backbone structures and surfaces will capture the flexible nature of protein structures through the use of ensemble of conformations, while maintaining high computational efficiency. These models will also enable effective characterization of family-specific variations among proteins, an important task none of the existing methods work well; (5) Protein/RNA structures will be organized using network-based data structures using probabilistic approaches. This new organization will effectively integrates sequence, backbone structure, and surface information, facilitating discovery of novel insight; and (6) these new development will be rapidly generalized for studying chromosome structures. This proposed research will allow development of tools that will also be applicable in other areas of shape analysis, including medical image analysis, computer vision, and pattern recognition. Our work will help to increase the communication between the field of protein structure analysis and the field of shape analysis, and will stimulate more cross-over development in methodology and transform research activities in both fields. Analysis, classification and organization of biomolecules are fundamental tasks essential for understanding the sequence-structure-function relationships of biomolecules.

"MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is to develop MELD, a computational Bayesian accelerator that “melds” together molecular dynamics simulations with external knowledge. It is novel in harnessing information that has not been usable before – because it is too sparse, noisy, ambiguous, combinatoric, or too corrupted for traditional approaches. In contrast to the high-certainty restraints traditionally used in MD simulations, MELD leverages a much broader range of real-world high-uncertainty restraints. The first specific aim is to incorporate such information in protein structure determination, in several collaboration projects with experimentalists who perform solution x-ray scattering, ESR, and high-throughput alanine scanning structures of peptide protein complexes. The second aim is to also harness information about processes, trajectories, and dynamic routes to speed the identification of protein states. MELD promises to extend physics-based simulations for determining larger protein structures, for folding larger proteins, for binding more flexible ligands, and for exploring larger mechanistic actions, than current MD simulation methods can handle. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biomedical research and pharmaceutics depend on detailed understanding of the structures and motions of proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations provide the most detailed descriptions possible, however they cannot yet describe average to large sized protein structures or motions within a reasonable time frame. We propose to develop a new physics-based computational accelerator for Molecular Dynamics, called MELD, which incorporates many types of relevant external information that was too vague and difficult to compute to have been practically useful before.",MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference,9422220,R01GM125813,"['Affinity', 'Alanine', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Pharmacy (field)', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Virginia', 'base', 'blind', 'computer based statistical methods', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'peptide structure', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'scale up', 'simulation']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2018,316515,0.13679261379419608
"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Accurate description of protein structure and interactions is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics and drugs. However, there is a large gap between the number of available protein sequences and the number of proteins (complexes) with solved structures and accurate interaction description, which has to be filled by computational prediction. The long-term goal of this project is to apply statistical machine learning and optimization algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship by analyzing low- and high-throughput sequence, structure and functional data and to develop algorithms for structure and functional prediction. Our hypothesis is that by developing sophisticated algorithms to take advantage of the growing sequence and structure data, we can model sequence-structure relationship much more accurately and significantly improve structure and functional prediction, in particular for this proposal, residue (atomic) interaction strength prediction and remote homology detection. This project has produced a few CASP-winning, widely-used data-driven algorithms and web server (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) for monomer protein modeling. This renewal will not only further develop machine learning algorithms (especially Deep Learning and probabilistic graphical models) for monomer proteins, but also branch out to protein interactions (complexes). The specific aims are: (1) develop novel structure learning algorithms to predict inter-reside contacts and coevolved residues; (2) develop context-specific, coevolution-based, and distance-dependent statistical potentials using a new machine learning model called Deep Conditional (Markov) Neural Fields (DeepCNF); (3) develop Markov Random Fields (MRF) and DeepCNF methods for remote protein (interface/complex) homology detection and fold recognition to make use of long-range residue interaction predicted by the first two aims. This renewal will lead to further understanding and new models of protein sequence-structure-function relationship and yield publicly available software and servers for automated, accurate, quantitative analysis for a wide range of proteins and their interactions.

"Protein structure determination from low-resolution experimental data Project Abstract Determination of a protein’s three-dimensional structure is of critical importance in biology, providing insights to biological mechanisms and important targets for drug design. While high- resolution X-ray diffraction data provides an atomic view of cellular components, for many interesting and biologically relevant complexes, it may only be possible to obtain low-resolution structural information. Both cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, when applied to large, flexible molecular machines, often produce data of 3-6 Å resolution. Extracting detailed atomic information from this data, critical in understanding function, the effects of mutation, or in designing drugs is impossible due to the low number of observations and the large conformational space proteins may adopt. I propose to develop computational methods for extracting high-resolution atomic models from this low-resolution data, bridging the “resolution gap” with computational methods. My proposed research develops and extends our labs’ methods for automatically inferring atomic accuracy models, from these “near-atomic” resolution sources of experimental data. We develop novel conformational sampling methods, guided by experimental data, to infer atomic information both in cases where homologous high-resolution data is available, and where it is not. Additionally, we propose development of methods for estimating model uncertainty; these are critical in understanding to what degree structural conclusions may be made from a particular dataset. Finally, in pushing the resolution limit further, we develop general tools for biomolecular forcefield optimization. These machine-learning tools will allow development of a next-generation forcefield, critical in extending the resolution limit of data from which we can infer atomic details. The overall goal of the proposed research is robust and accessible methods to determine protein structures to atomic accuracy from only sparse experimental data. Combined, the three aims in this proposal will lead to dramatic improvements in our ability to infer atomic interactions from sparse experimental data. This will lead to determination of structures that will reveal key insights into how biomedically important protein complexes perform their function and what goes wrong in human disease. Project Narrative This project develops computational tools for accurately determining protein structure from low- resolution experimental data.

"Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes Despite rapid progress in structural bioinformatics, a rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical framework is missing in our current toolbox for analysis, classification, and organization of individual as well as groups of biomolecules. We have recently developed such a framework based on the elastic shape analysis (ESA) for the comparison of protein and RNA structures. Under this framework, the formal geodesic distance for any two protein/RNA structures can be computed rapidly. Probability distributions can also be built for families of protein/RNA structures, and can be used to classify structures in a principled way through statistical hypothesis testing. In addition, sequence information can be naturally incorporated so that comparison of structures can be conducted in the joint sequence-structure space. We have also developed novel algorithms for matching and analyzing protein surfaces.

Furthermore, we will combine the modeling power of our structural Input-Output hidden Markov model with experimental small- angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to predict the tertiary structures of large multi-domain proteins.

"Data-driven analysis of protein structure, function, and regulation PROJECT SUMMARY Proteins are capable of performing a wide variety of complex molecular functions and play a central role in all biological processes. A detailed and quantitative understanding of the relationship between a protein's sequence and it's biochemical properties would have a profound impact across all areas of biology, medicine, and biotechnology. We are developing data-driven approaches for dissecting the molecular basis of protein function. Our general framework involves designing informative libraries of protein sequences, experimentally mapping the relationship between sequence and function, and extracting detailed functional information from large sequence-function data sets. This work leverages emerging technologies and methods in DNA sequencing and synthesis, microfluidic screening, large-scale statistical learning, and optimization. We will develop generalizable platforms that can be applied to study a wide variety of enzymes and membrane transport proteins.

"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research described in the current proposal has the long-range goals of enabling the prediction of protein-protein interactions and the application of this knowledge to problems of biomedical relevance. An additional long-term goal is the fuller integration of Structural and Systems Biology. Specific Aims include: a) The development of three-dimensional structure-based methods to predict, on a genome-wide scale, whether and how two proteins interact. b) The integration of structural information with other sources of evidence as to protein-protein interactions. c) The application of the methods being developed to important biomedical problems. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, cellular function is mediated by tens or even hundreds of thousands of protein-protein interactions yet these are generally hard to predict in advance or to measure accurately with high-throughput experimental techniques. A method that allows the computational prediction of such interactions would thus be of significant impact. Second, there are many more protein sequences than protein structures so it is necessary to find ways to amplify the information in protein databases if structure is to be fully integrated in genome scale research. The proposed research is intended to bridge this gap.  A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins. Since structure is better conserved than sequence, these alignments can reveal new information. A novel structure-based method is introduced which exploits homology models and remote geometric relationships to amplify structural information. The evidence that is obtained is then combined with non-structural sources of evidence using Bayesian networks to yield a probability of whether two proteins interact. An important element in the proposed research strategy is the recognition that structural modeling on a large scale is necessarily imprecise so that it is necessary to use low resolution ""scoring functions for a given model that do not depend sensitively on atomic detail. Bayesian methods then allow the extraction of a clear signal from the underlying noise.  The biological impact of the research will be enhanced through computational/experimental applications in areas where structural clues have the potential of discovering truly novel interactions. Validated predictions on adhesion proteins, nuclear hormone receptors and cytokine signaling proteins demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology. New applications to viral host interactions and to cancer signaling pathways are described. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health relatedness of the proposed research arises from the fact that a better understanding of protein- protein interactions opens the way to a better understanding of the biology underlying human disease.

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Accurate description of protein structure and interactions is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics and drugs. However, there is a large gap between the number of available protein sequences and the number of proteins (complexes) with solved structures and accurate interaction description, which has to be filled by computational prediction. The long-term goal of this project is to apply statistical machine learning and optimization algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship by analyzing low- and high-throughput sequence, structure and functional data and to develop algorithms for structure and functional prediction. Our hypothesis is that by developing sophisticated algorithms to take advantage of the growing sequence and structure data, we can model sequence-structure relationship much more accurately and significantly improve structure and functional prediction, in particular for this proposal, residue (atomic) interaction strength prediction and remote homology detection. This project has produced a few CASP-winning, widely-used data-driven algorithms and web server (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) for monomer protein modeling. This renewal will not only further develop machine learning algorithms (especially Deep Learning and probabilistic graphical models) for monomer proteins, but also branch out to protein interactions (complexes). The specific aims are: (1) develop novel structure learning algorithms to predict inter-reside contacts and coevolved residues; (2) develop context-specific, coevolution-based, and distance-dependent statistical potentials using a new machine learning model called Deep Conditional (Markov) Neural Fields (DeepCNF); (3) develop Markov Random Fields (MRF) and DeepCNF methods for remote protein (interface/complex) homology detection and fold recognition to make use of long-range residue interaction predicted by the first two aims. This renewal will lead to further understanding and new models of protein sequence-structure-function relationship and yield publicly available software and servers for automated, accurate, quantitative analysis for a wide range of proteins and their interactions. The impact will be multiplied by tens of thousands of worldwide users employing the resulting software/servers to study a wide variety of proteins and interactions relevant to basic biological research and human diseases, in both low- and high-throughput experiments. Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. This proposal develops algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship and to predict protein structures and interactions. The results will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as better understanding of disease processes, development of novel diagnostics and drugs, and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs.",New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction,9030836,R01GM089753,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Homologous Gene', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Occupations', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Preventive', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homologs', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Translations', 'Work', 'atomic interactions', 'base', 'biological research', 'deep field survey', 'human disease', 'improved', 'monomer', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'therapeutic development', 'tool']",NIGMS,TOYOTA TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE / CHICAGO,R01,2015,268175,0.17889661528839618
"Integrated Prediction and Validation of Protein Structures ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of three-dimensional protein structure is indispensable in biomedical research. Protein structure and function are intimately linked, and thus structure facilitates drug discovery, aids investigations of protein-protein interactions, informs mutagenesis analysis, guides protein engineering and the design of new proteins, and provides a foundation for understanding the molecular basis of disease. However, the number of protein sequences available in the genomic era far exceeds the capacity of the main experimental structure determination techniques of X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, resulting in a substantial sequence- structure gap. We address this ever-widening gap by developing and disseminating novel protein structure modeling tools. This renewal project is a new collaboration between experts in computational modeling (Cheng) and experimental structural biology (Tanner). We plan to develop innovative, integrated machine learning (e.g., deep learning), data mining and statistical modeling methods to address major challenges in both template-based structure modeling and template-free (ab initio) structure modeling. We will apply these tools to enzymes in the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily, a group of enzymes that are involved in numerous important biological processes and implicated in many diseases due to mutations.

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete description of protein structures is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life, and is also highly relevant medically in the development of therapeutics and drugs. The broad, long-term goal of the project is to develop machine learning methods for data-driven protein structure prediction through two independent but complementary strategies: 1) much more accurate template-based modeling for proteins with remote homologs in the Protein Data Bank and 2) better template-free modeling method for proteins without detectable templates and for improving template-based models. The specific aims are: Aim 1) to greatly improve template-based modeling by 1a) improving protein sequence-template alignment using a regression-tree-based nonlinear scoring function, especially when good sequence profiles are unavailable; and 1b) improving fold recognition using a machine learning method to combine both residue-level and atom-level features; Aim 2) to improve protein conformation sampling in a continuous space and thus template-free modeling by three independent but complementary approaches: 2a) modeling nonlinear sequence- structure relationship using Conditional (Markov) Random Fields (CRF) models; 2b) simultaneously sampling secondary and tertiary structure; and 2c) learning structure information from template. The core of the project is to develop various CRF models for data-driven protein structure prediction, by learning protein sequence-structure relationship from existing sequence/structure databases. The product of this research includes a regression-tree-based CRF model for accurate protein alignment, especially for proteins without close homologs in the PDB or without very good sequence profiles; a SVM model for protein fold recognition; a few CRF models for efficient protein conformation sampling in a continuous space; and a complete protein structure prediction software package. Also, it will produce a web server publicly available for various academic and biomedical users.

"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research described in the current proposal has the long-range goals of enabling the prediction of protein-protein interactions and the application of this knowledge to problems of biomedical relevance. An additional long-term goal is the fuller integration of Structural and Systems Biology. Specific Aims include: a) The development of three-dimensional structure-based methods to predict, on a genome-wide scale, whether and how two proteins interact. b) The integration of structural information with other sources of evidence as to protein-protein interactions. c) The application of the methods being developed to important biomedical problems. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, cellular function is mediated by tens or even hundreds of thousands of protein-protein interactions yet these are generally hard to predict in advance or to measure accurately with high-throughput experimental techniques. A method that allows the computational prediction of such interactions would thus be of significant impact. Second, there are many more protein sequences than protein structures so it is necessary to find ways to amplify the information in protein databases if structure is to be fully integrated in genome scale research. The proposed research is intended to bridge this gap.  A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins. Since structure is better conserved than sequence, these alignments can reveal new information. A novel structure-based method is introduced which exploits homology models and remote geometric relationships to amplify structural information. The evidence that is obtained is then combined with non-structural sources of evidence using Bayesian networks to yield a probability of whether two proteins interact. An important element in the proposed research strategy is the recognition that structural modeling on a large scale is necessarily imprecise so that it is necessary to use low resolution ""scoring functions for a given model that do not depend sensitively on atomic detail. Bayesian methods then allow the extraction of a clear signal from the underlying noise.  The biological impact of the research will be enhanced through computational/experimental applications in areas where structural clues have the potential of discovering truly novel interactions. Validated predictions on adhesion proteins, nuclear hormone receptors and cytokine signaling proteins demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology. New applications to viral host interactions and to cancer signaling pathways are described.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health relatedness of the proposed research arises from the fact that a better understanding of protein- protein interactions opens the way to a better understanding of the biology underlying human disease.

"Integrated Prediction of Protein Struture at 1D, 2D and 3D Levels    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational prediction of protein structure from the amino acid sequence is one of the most important and challenging problems in bioinformatics and computational biology. With the exponential growth of protein sequences without solved protein structures in the post-genomic era, accurate protein structure prediction methods and tools are in urgent need. Here, we propose to develop an integrated approach to advance protein structure prediction at the 1-dimensional (1D), 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) levels. At the 1D level, novel information such as domain evolution signals, alternative gene splicing sites, and 2D protein contact map will be used to predict protein domain boundaries from the sequences. At the 2D level, new methods such as residue contact propagation, machine learning boosting, linear programming, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations will be used to advance residue-residue contact prediction for a domain, or a protein. At the 3D level, 2D contact prediction, fold recognition via machine learning, and multi-template combination will be used to enhance both template-based and ab initio structure prediction. Finally, knowledge-based statistical machine learning methods and model combination algorithms will be developed to reliably evaluate and refine the quality of predicted protein structural models. One of several innovative aspects of this approach is to integrate 1D, 2D, and 3D predictions in order to improve each other through protein structural unit - domains. The 1D, 2D, and 3D protein structure prediction methods will be implemented as user-friendly software packages and web services released to the scientific community. These tools and web services will be useful for protein structure prediction, structure determination, functional analysis, protein engineering, protein mutagenesis analysis, and protein design.

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete description of protein structures is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life, and is also highly relevant medically in the development of therapeutics and drugs. The broad, long-term goal of the project is to develop machine learning methods for data-driven protein structure prediction through two independent but complementary strategies: 1) much more accurate template-based modeling for proteins with remote homologs in the Protein Data Bank and 2) better template-free modeling method for proteins without detectable templates and for improving template-based models. The specific aims are: Aim 1) to greatly improve template-based modeling by 1a) improving protein sequence-template alignment using a regression-tree-based nonlinear scoring function, especially when good sequence profiles are unavailable; and 1b) improving fold recognition using a machine learning method to combine both residue-level and atom-level features; Aim 2) to improve protein conformation sampling in a continuous space and thus template-free modeling by three independent but complementary approaches: 2a) modeling nonlinear sequence- structure relationship using Conditional (Markov) Random Fields (CRF) models; 2b) simultaneously sampling secondary and tertiary structure; and 2c) learning structure information from template. The core of the project is to develop various CRF models for data-driven protein structure prediction, by learning protein sequence-structure relationship from existing sequence/structure databases. The product of this research includes a regression-tree-based CRF model for accurate protein alignment, especially for proteins without close homologs in the PDB or without very good sequence profiles; a SVM model for protein fold recognition; a few CRF models for efficient protein conformation sampling in a continuous space; and a complete protein structure prediction software package. Also, it will produce a web server publicly available for various academic and biomedical users. Protein structure prediction will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as the development of novel diagnostics, better understanding of disease processes and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs.

"Improving Modeling by Learning from Details of High Accuracy Protein Structures     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The functions of proteins depend exquisitely on their structure, with details at the 0.1 ¿ scale influencing enzyme catalysis, disease-causing mutations, and drug recognition. For this reason, having detailed and accurate structures of proteins is a cornerstone of modern biomedical research, and the NIH funded the Protein Structure Initiative with the goal of obtaining models for every protein structure with an accuracy approaching that of a high-resolution crystal structure. Current technology for template-based modeling is powerful, but cannot yet deliver ""near-crystal-structure"" quality. Tests show that the best minimization routines still fall short of consistently producing protein models for close homologs that approach within ~1 ¿ rmsd of the 'native' structure as ultimately revealed by crystal structures. To help break through this 1 ¿ barrier, during the previous period of support we used ultrahigh-resolution structures to create a library of conformation- dependent ideal geometry functions for the protein backbone, and showed that its use improves the quality of protein crystal structures and holds promise to improve template-based model refinement. We also discovered that ultrahigh-resolution crystal structures are a rich source of details about protein structure that are not accurately attainable from structures in the ~1.5-2 ¿ resolution range and thus have not yet been fully accounted for in current energy functions. Here, our central hypothesis is that a major step forward in template-based modeling accuracy will come from identifying and explicitly taking into account detailed features of protein covalent geometry, conformation and non-covalent packing interactions that have not yet been characterized, and can now be gleaned from the study of highly accurate ultrahigh-resolution protein structures. The overall goal of our proposal is to mine such information so it can be used to improve the accuracy of predictive modeling. With many ultrahigh-resolution structures now available, the time is ripe to achieve this goal by pursuing three specific aims related to (1) extending the impact of the 'ideal geometry function' paradigm by creating, optimizing, and implementing conformation- dependent libraries accounting for peptide planarity, side chains, and cis-peptides, (2) mining ultrahigh- resolution crystal structures to glean information for next-generation empirical energy functions, and (3) analyzing ultrahigh-resolution protein structures solved in varying environments to produce a set of benchmark test cases and developing residue level assessment tools to use with these test cases to evaluate and hone template-based modeling refinement applications. This proposed work is low cost and low risk, and has a high likelihood of substantial impact as it provides basic information that can be widely incorporated into predictive and experimental modeling applications to improve their accuracy.

"Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the principles that control the machinery of biomolecular systems is a computational challenge in many cases due to the involvement of macromolecular structures composed of multiple subunits and cooperative interactions manifested by allosteric changes in conformations, which are beyond the range of atomic simulations. Our goal in a recently funded R33 has been to develop and utilize low resolution models for exploring the collective dynamics of such complex systems, and bridging between structure and function, based on the paradigm structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The elastic network models and methods we introduced to this aim have found utility in many applications and helped us gain insights into the intrinsic, structure- encoded ability of proteins to favor the reconfiguration of native structures between functional substates.

With the exponential growth of protein sequences without solved protein structures in the post-genomic era, accurate protein structure prediction methods and tools are in urgent need. Here, we propose to develop an integrated approach to advance protein structure prediction at the 1-dimensional (1D), 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) levels. At the 1D level, novel information such as domain evolution signals, alternative gene splicing sites, and 2D protein contact map will be used to predict protein domain boundaries from the sequences. At the 2D level, new methods such as residue contact propagation, machine learning boosting, linear programming, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations will be used to advance residue-residue contact prediction for a domain, or a protein. At the 3D level, 2D contact prediction, fold recognition via machine learning, and multi-template combination will be used to enhance both template-based and ab initio structure prediction.

"Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein structure prediction is one of the great challenges in structural biology. The ability to accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins would bring about significant scientific advances and would facilitate finding cures and treatments for many diseases. We propose a novel computational framework for protein structure prediction. The novelty of the framework lies in its approach to conformation space search. Conformation space search is considered to be the primary bottleneck towards consistent, high-resolution prediction. The proposed approach to conformation space search represents a major conceptual shift in protein structure prediction, made possible by combining insights and algorithms from robotics and machine learning with techniques from molecular biology in an innovative manner. The key innovation comes from the insight that target-specific information can effectively guide conformation space search towards biologically relevant regions. We propose to develop a framework for protein structure prediction that achieves biological accuracy and computational efficiency by guiding conformation space search using target-specific information. The proposed framework exploits two sources of target-specific information: 1) information about the characteristics of the target's energy landscape acquired continuously during search, and 2) spatial restraints about the target's structure obtained from NMR experiments. As search progresses, the continuous integration of these sources of information will tailor conformation space search to the particular characteristics of the target. This tailored conformation space exploration can overcome the current bottleneck, yielding highly accurate and efficient structure prediction. The ability to determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins, which represent the molecular machinery inside every cell, would greatly facilitate finding cures or treatments for many diseases. This research effort will develop of a novel, efficient, and biologically accurate computational approach to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins.           n/a",Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search,8111224,R01GM076706,"['Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Space Explorations', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'research study', 'restraint', 'structural biology', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2011,227860,0.17232930737767424
"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete description of protein structures is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life, and is also highly relevant medically in the development of therapeutics and drugs. The broad, long-term goal of the project is to develop machine learning methods for data-driven protein structure prediction through two independent but complementary strategies: 1) much more accurate template-based modeling for proteins with remote homologs in the Protein Data Bank and 2) better template-free modeling method for proteins without detectable templates and for improving template-based models. The specific aims are: Aim 1) to greatly improve template-based modeling by 1a) improving protein sequence-template alignment using a regression-tree-based nonlinear scoring function, especially when good sequence profiles are unavailable; and 1b) improving fold recognition using a machine learning method to combine both residue-level and atom-level features; Aim 2) to improve protein conformation sampling in a continuous space and thus template-free modeling by three independent but complementary approaches: 2a) modeling nonlinear sequence- structure relationship using Conditional (Markov) Random Fields (CRF) models; 2b) simultaneously sampling secondary and tertiary structure; and 2c) learning structure information from template. The core of the project is to develop various CRF models for data-driven protein structure prediction, by learning protein sequence-structure relationship from existing sequence/structure databases. The product of this research includes a regression-tree-based CRF model for accurate protein alignment, especially for proteins without close homologs in the PDB or without very good sequence profiles; a SVM model for protein fold recognition; a few CRF models for efficient protein conformation sampling in a continuous space; and a complete protein structure prediction software package. Also, it will produce a web server publicly available for various academic and biomedical users.

"Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A detailed and accurate understanding of the structure of proteins is one cornerstone of modern biomedical research, and an explicit goal of the NIH is to define the structure of all proteins either by accurate experimental determination or comparative model-building. The most successful structure prediction approaches employ empirical knowledge-based energy terms derived from features of known protein structures - most notably single-residue ???-distributions, backbone-dependent side chain rotamer preferences, and tight packing criteria. One known unrealistic feature of these prediction programs is the assumption of a fixed ideal geometry for the backbone. The driving hypothesis behind this proposal is that there exists a largely unappreciated but real, systematic, significant and pervasive variation in backbone bond angles and peptide planarity that occurs as a function of backbone torsion angles, and accounting properly for this variation will be required to achieve X-ray crystal structure quality for comparative models. The overall goal of this work is to generate accurate empirical values for this covalent variation that will lead to tangible improvements in the accuracy of structures produced by comparative modeling and de novo structure prediction as well as by X-ray crystallography. We propose to achieve this overall goal by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) to design, develop, and make available a flexibly-searchable database containing bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles for all structures known at better than 1.75 ¿ resolution (currently ~500,000 residues); 2) to use conventional query-based and modern machine learning approaches to derive accurate empirical information from the database about the systematic correlation of local conformation with variations in covalent geometry; and 3) to create a modular conformation-dependent expected covalent geometry library and to facilitate its incorporation into leading applications for comparative and crystallographic protein structure modeling. With the dramatically increased number of ultrahigh-resolution resolution crystal structures now known, the time is ripe for construction of this Protein Geometry Database that will provide facile access to a massive treasure trove of reliable and detailed empirical information about protein structure. To be done well, this work will require painstaking attention to detail and an intimate familiarity with the limitations of crystallographic refinement and the principles of protein structure. Dr. Karplus is well-suited to lead this work as he has a 20+-year track record of quality crystallographic structure determinations combined with contributions of more general insights into protein structure, among them being the pioneering characterization of the conformation-dependent variations in covalent geometry that serves as this project's foundation. Collaborations with world-leading groups in structure prediction, in crystallographic refinement and structure validation, and in knowledge-based library development ensure a rapid and effective translation of the gleaned information into improvements in protein modeling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proteins are responsible for carrying out most of the processes of life and their function depends exquisitely on their structure, even on the tiniest structural details. For this reason, determining accurate structures of proteins is a cornerstone of modern biomedical research. This work is aimed at leading to a universal improvement in the accuracy with which protein structure can be built.           n/a",Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins,8111114,R01GM083136,"['Accounting', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomedical Research', 'Catalysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Crystallography', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Homology Modeling', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'molecular mechanics', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics']",NIGMS,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,208186,0.23078387813502244

"Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY: Over 25,000 researchers in the US and over 50,000 in 120 other countries have exploited the PredictProtein (PP) Internet server to analyze proteins by homology-transfer and by eye novo predictions of protein structure and function. Here, we propose technical and scientific solutions that will improve the functionality of PP and its extension portal META-PP. Many technical changes will remain hidden to users and are required to increase the maintainability, scalability, and portability of these servers. New Graphical User Interfaces are one proposed solution that will visibly impact the service. The scientific solutions address two related tasks pertaining to the prediction of structure and function. The first is to predict the effect of mutations. We propose the development of novel machine learning-based methods to distinguish between mutations that affect structure, function, or have no apparent phenotype. Our final method will be applied to the screening of SNP data from our experimental colleagues at Columbia, as well as to the prediction of SNP effects in public databases. The second major task is the identification of natively unstructured regions and their functional classification. Proteins that do not adopt regular structures in isolation are increasingly becoming an important research area; they may provide a key to the evolution of complexity from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. We propose the development of a machine learning-based identification of features specific to this important class of molecules. We also plan to attack the problem from a very different angle by using predictions of interaction densities inside proteins. The resulting novel tools will allow a proteome-wide analysis of the role of these molecules. All methods will be made available through PP.      RELEVANCE: Information about protein structure adds an entire dimension to protein analysis and genome annotation. This addition is often essential to infer function even for natively unstructured proteins. The PredictProtein server is unique in its combination and exploitation of evolution, structure, and function; many thousands of theoretical, experimental, and clinical researches have benefited from this. The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to improve our ability to use the evolutionary record of amino acid substitutions, i.e. to ultimately understand the amino acid ""language"". The short-term goal is to address two tasks that are closely related to human diseases, namely the distinction between silent and important mutations and the mapping of unstructured proteins onto networks and diseases.          n/a",Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein,7842572,R01LM007329,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Eukaryota', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Induced Mutation', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Point Mutation', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'portability', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2010,327180,0.14346841579806976
"Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein structure prediction is one of the great challenges in structural biology. The ability to accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins would bring about significant scientific advances and would facilitate finding cures and treatments for many diseases. We propose a novel computational framework for protein structure prediction. The novelty of the framework lies in its approach to conformation space search. Conformation space search is considered to be the primary bottleneck towards consistent, high-resolution prediction. The proposed approach to conformation space search represents a major conceptual shift in protein structure prediction, made possible by combining insights and algorithms from robotics and machine learning with techniques from molecular biology in an innovative manner. The key innovation comes from the insight that target-specific information can effectively guide conformation space search towards biologically relevant regions. We propose to develop a framework for protein structure prediction that achieves biological accuracy and computational efficiency by guiding conformation space search using target-specific information. The proposed framework exploits two sources of target-specific information: 1) information about the characteristics of the target's energy landscape acquired continuously during search, and 2) spatial restraints about the target's structure obtained from NMR experiments. As search progresses, the continuous integration of these sources of information will tailor conformation space search to the particular characteristics of the target. This tailored conformation space exploration can overcome the current bottleneck, yielding highly accurate and efficient structure prediction. The ability to determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins, which represent the molecular machinery inside every cell, would greatly facilitate finding cures or treatments for many diseases. This research effort will develop of a novel, efficient, and biologically accurate computational approach to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins.           n/a",Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search,7826646,R01GM076706,"['Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Muscle Rigidity', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Space Explorations', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'research study', 'restraint', 'structural biology', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2010,230653,0.17232930737767424
"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete description of protein structures is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life, and is also highly relevant medically in the development of therapeutics and drugs. The broad, long-term goal of the project is to develop machine learning methods for data-driven protein structure prediction through two independent but complementary strategies: 1) much more accurate template-based modeling for proteins with remote homologs in the Protein Data Bank and 2) better template-free modeling method for proteins without detectable templates and for improving template-based models. The specific aims are: Aim 1) to greatly improve template-based modeling by 1a) improving protein sequence-template alignment using a regression-tree-based nonlinear scoring function, especially when good sequence profiles are unavailable; and 1b) improving fold recognition using a machine learning method to combine both residue-level and atom-level features; Aim 2) to improve protein conformation sampling in a continuous space and thus template-free modeling by three independent but complementary approaches: 2a) modeling nonlinear sequence- structure relationship using Conditional (Markov) Random Fields (CRF) models; 2b) simultaneously sampling secondary and tertiary structure; and 2c) learning structure information from template. The core of the project is to develop various CRF models for data-driven protein structure prediction, by learning protein sequence-structure relationship from existing sequence/structure databases. The product of this research includes a regression-tree-based CRF model for accurate protein alignment, especially for proteins without close homologs in the PDB or without very good sequence profiles; a SVM model for protein fold recognition; a few CRF models for efficient protein conformation sampling in a continuous space; and a complete protein structure prediction software package. Also, it will produce a web server publicly available for various academic and biomedical users.

"Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A detailed and accurate understanding of the structure of proteins is one cornerstone of modern biomedical research, and an explicit goal of the NIH is to define the structure of all proteins either by accurate experimental determination or comparative model-building. The most successful structure prediction approaches employ empirical knowledge-based energy terms derived from features of known protein structures - most notably single-residue ???-distributions, backbone-dependent side chain rotamer preferences, and tight packing criteria. One known unrealistic feature of these prediction programs is the assumption of a fixed ideal geometry for the backbone. The driving hypothesis behind this proposal is that there exists a largely unappreciated but real, systematic, significant and pervasive variation in backbone bond angles and peptide planarity that occurs as a function of backbone torsion angles, and accounting properly for this variation will be required to achieve X-ray crystal structure quality for comparative models. The overall goal of this work is to generate accurate empirical values for this covalent variation that will lead to tangible improvements in the accuracy of structures produced by comparative modeling and de novo structure prediction as well as by X-ray crystallography. We propose to achieve this overall goal by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) to design, develop, and make available a flexibly-searchable database containing bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles for all structures known at better than 1.75 ¿ resolution (currently ~500,000 residues); 2) to use conventional query-based and modern machine learning approaches to derive accurate empirical information from the database about the systematic correlation of local conformation with variations in covalent geometry; and 3) to create a modular conformation-dependent expected covalent geometry library and to facilitate its incorporation into leading applications for comparative and crystallographic protein structure modeling. With the dramatically increased number of ultrahigh-resolution resolution crystal structures now known, the time is ripe for construction of this Protein Geometry Database that will provide facile access to a massive treasure trove of reliable and detailed empirical information about protein structure. To be done well, this work will require painstaking attention to detail and an intimate familiarity with the limitations of crystallographic refinement and the principles of protein structure. Dr. Karplus is well-suited to lead this work as he has a 20+-year track record of quality crystallographic structure determinations combined with contributions of more general insights into protein structure, among them being the pioneering characterization of the conformation-dependent variations in covalent geometry that serves as this project's foundation. Collaborations with world-leading groups in structure prediction, in crystallographic refinement and structure validation, and in knowledge-based library development ensure a rapid and effective translation of the gleaned information into improvements in protein modeling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proteins are responsible for carrying out most of the processes of life and their function depends exquisitely on their structure, even on the tiniest structural details. For this reason, determining accurate structures of proteins is a cornerstone of modern biomedical research. This work is aimed at leading to a universal improvement in the accuracy with which protein structure can be built.           n/a",Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins,7905142,R01GM083136,"['Accounting', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomedical Research', 'Catalysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Crystallography', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Homology Modeling', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'molecular mechanics', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics']",NIGMS,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,210764,0.23078387813502244
"Optimization of Stuctures and Networks of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application has three major aims that exploit the use of mathematical programming tools for biophysically motivated problems. The first goal is the refinement of protein structures that are obtained from homology. Structures based on homology are rarely of atomic resolution; a resolution which is necessary for detailed modeling of protein function, and for the design of drug molecules. Based on mathematical programming approach a new class of energy functions, suitable for the refinement problem, will be designed. The second goal is to investigate a new type of network; the network of sequence flow between protein structures. We examine the process in which new sequences, generated by point mutations, remain in the current fold, or switch to other stable structures (we exclude sequences with no stable fold). The adjustments to the structure are accepted or rejected based on stability criterion. The net. work defines a master equation which makes it possible to investigate past (ancient) folds, and future structures that serve as attractors. The third aim examines the network of protein-protein (physical) interactions and will be examined with bioinformatics and biophysical approaches. Comparison will be made between the network of sequence flow and the network of protein-protein interactions to better understand the evolution of biological mechanisms and recognition.

"Mechanisms of Protein Structure Evolution    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The traditional view of protein evolution has been that all protein domains are descendents of distinct evolutionary lines, that there are a relatively small number of such lines (about 1000), and that these lines are all of relatively ancient origin. Two new bodies of evidence make that view untenable. First, analysis of sets of fully sequenced genomes shows that most protein families appear to be small, and narrowly distributed in phylogenetic space, apparently implying recent emergence. Second, analysis of the relationship between known protein structures shows that there are many more than a 1000 distinct folds, appearing to imply many more evolutionary lines. The large discrepancy between theory and fact has been clear for some time and a number of explanations have been put forward. But so far there has been no definitive study of alternatives. In this project we will systematically and quantitatively investigate four separate hypotheses, each of which may account for some share of the large number of protein folds and apparently young proteins: that these (1) are the result of generation of new open reading frames or frame shifted older ones; (2) are the outcome of extensive recombination of portions of older proteins; (3) are laterally transferred from unexplored parts of phylogenetic space; (4) are part of larger older families where there has been rapid sequence change, such that not all relatives are found. To investigate these hypotheses we will develop and extend a set of computational methods. These include methods of building protein families; reliably estimating the age of protein families, detecting lateral gene transfer effects; determining to what extent members of families are likely to have been detected with sequence methods; more quantitatively determining whether protein structures are evolutionarily related; searching for remote structure and sequence relationships; and analyzing a range of protein properties as a function of family age. We will also construct a web resource for distributing the results and soliciting extensive community annotation and discussion.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the structural and functional adaptive properties of protein molecules underpins many aspects of medicine, particularly the emergence of new viruses, drug design, and combating resistance to new therapeutics in infectious diseases.           Project Narrative Understanding the structural and functional adaptive properties of protein molecules underpins many aspects of medicine, particularly the emergence of new viruses, drug design, and combating resistance to new therapeutics in infectious diseases.",Mechanisms of Protein Structure Evolution,7933643,R01GM081511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Appearance', 'Bacteriophages', 'Calibration', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Generations', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metagenomics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Virus', 'base', 'combat', 'genome sequencing', 'member', 'novel therapeutics', 'numb protein', 'prokaryotic kingdom', 'protein folding', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'theories']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2010,296842,0.10249629165851847
"Comparative genomics of protein structure and function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work aims to develop methods to identify functional sites in protein structures and to characterize protein function on a genomic scale. The approach is predicated on the Evolutionary Trace method (ET) to locate functional sites in structures. Preliminary studies enabled us to automate the basic steps towards a complete, automated functional annotation pipeline, namely, functional site analysis with ET; extraction from ET analysis of SD-templates that describe composition and conformation of key residues involved in binding or catalytic function; the search in other structures for geometric matches to these 3D-templates; and the analysis of which of those matched are most biologically relevant. We now seek to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the annotation pipeline by optimizing the definition of 3-D templates, by adding new template features to better judge whether molecular mimicry underlies functional similarity; and by developing novel strategies that use multiple templates to identify function. The result will reveal which regions of proteins are most biologically relevant, and hence logical targets for protein engineering and drug design, and it will extend to three dimensions a functional annotation strategy traditionally based on one- dimensional pattern matching in protein sequences. In so doing, this work addresses a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in ""post-genomic biology"": linking massive and exponentially growing amounts of raw sequence and structure data to the molecular basis of biological function.           n/a",Comparative genomics of protein structure and function,7786185,R01GM079656,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Catalysis', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Design', 'Electrostatics', 'Enzymes', 'Failure', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'PAWR protein', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Solvents', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative genomics', 'computer studies', 'conformer', 'database structure', 'design', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'heuristics', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'mimetics', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2010,278531,0.13988228290279994
"Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the principles that control the machinery of biomolecular systems is a computational challenge in many cases due to the involvement of macromolecular structures composed of multiple subunits and cooperative interactions manifested by allosteric changes in conformations, which are beyond the range of atomic simulations. Our goal in a recently funded R33 has been to develop and utilize low resolution models for exploring the collective dynamics of such complex systems, and bridging between structure and function, based on the paradigm structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The elastic network models and methods we introduced to this aim have found utility in many applications and helped us gain insights into the intrinsic, structure- encoded ability of proteins to favor the reconfiguration of native structures between functional substates. In the present R01, we are proposing to build on our previous work, to further explore the structure -> dynamics -> function mapping of allosteric and/or multimeric proteins using physically-based and computationally efficient models in collaboration with the NCBC Simbios at Stanford U (PI: Altman). The Simbios group has already started to construct a new simulation package, Simbody, the utility of which is expected to be significantly enhanced by a collaborative work. Our specific aims are (1) to build models and methods for automated coarse-graining of complex structures at multiple levels of resolution and assessing their collective dynamics, toward using the resulting models (structure) and data (motions) in Simbody; (2) to complement the physics-based approach developed in Aim 1 by information-theoretic approaches toward delineating signal transduction pathways/mechanisms in allosteric systems, and establishing the connection between these pathways and structural dynamics, and (3) to gain insights into the machinery of molecular chaperones, using as prototypes the bacterial chaperonin GroEL-GroES and the DnaK chaperone system, in collaboration with the Gierasch lab currently doing NIH-supported experiments for understanding the allosteric dynamics of the DnaK system. An important outcome of this project will be the establishment of a methodology for simulating the machinery of biomolecular systems on the order of Megadaltons, which will be achieved in collaboration with the Schulten lab, in addition to our partnership with the Simbios team. Project Narrative  Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the dynamics or underlying molecular principles of these machines is a challenge due to the highly cooperative nature of interactions, which simultaneously involve multiple molecules. The aim of this project is twofold: to develop and implement computational models and methods to improve our understanding of the collective dynamics of proteins; and to elucidate the machinery of molecular chaperones - molecular systems that play an essential role in cellular physiology by assisting the folding and assembly/disassembly of proteins and directing them to transport and degradation pathways.

"Machine Learning and Visualization in Structural Biology    DESCRIPTION:       This project's main objective is to develop computerized tools that assist x-ray crystallographers in rapidly determining the three-dimensional structure of a protein. More specifically, this project addresses the following task: given a 3D electron-density map from crystallography and the sequence of the protein, find the most likely layout (i.e. ""trace"") of the protein sequence in 3D. The project will create both automated methods based on statistical machine-learning and computer-vision techniques, as well as visualization tools that support humans doing this layout. These two approaches complement each other and are synergistic.      This project's first specific aim is to develop and empirically evaluate algorithms that interpret crystallographic electron-density maps. The second specific aim is to incorporate structural-biology domain knowledge (secondary-structure prediction and potential-energy calculations) into the project's algorithms for interpreting density maps. The third specific aim is to tightly integrate partial model-construction with phase estimation updates to improve the recognition of 3D protein structures in x-ray reflection data; crystallographers will be able to intervene whenever they desire to help ""steer"" this iterative process. The final specific aim is to develop intuitive and effective modalities - including virtual reality and the use of speech/audio - for the efficient use of crystallographer's time in manual model fitting and validation.      Structural biology has wide relevance to biomedicine, since protein function generally follows from protein form (i.e., its structure). This project's techniques will speed-up the process of determining protein 3D structures, especially from low-quality (i.e., low-resolution) x-ray data, and will be applicable to other structural-biology tasks. Being able to accurately interpret low-resolution data promises to allow higher through put structure determination. The broader impact will include a better understanding of the power of modern theories and algorithms in machine learning and visualization in solving biological problems.         n/a",Machine Learning and Visualization in Structural Biology,7599114,R01LM008796,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupling', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Engineering', 'Error Sources', 'Evaluation', 'Freedom', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phase', 'Potential Energy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Right-On', 'Shapes', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data format', 'density', 'design', 'electron density', 'improved', 'method development', 'open source', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'structural biology', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'usability', 'virtual reality']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2009,306728,0.1507983533555413
"Algorithms for protein superfamily classification and function prediction The goal of this project is to develop new algorithms for protein function prediction. Recent rapid advancements in various technological developments produce biological data of unprecedented amount and complexity. Computational methods are becoming essential components in modern biomedical research. One of greatest challenges facing bioinformatician is the discovery of connections among different data sets and generating novel biological knowledge or hypotheses. Predicting the molecular function of novel proteins is ah urgent task for the post-genomics era. Especially, recent assessment of structural genomic efforts revealed a gap between experimental protein structure determination and the use ofthe structural knowledge for gaining understanding of biological function of the proteins at the molecular level. We will employ recent developments in discriminative machine learning approaches for constructing a residue-level classification system for function prediction from structure. Existing systems for functional prediction from structure either use global structural and sequence similarities over entire protein chain or use localized similarities such as putative functional sites. Our system will leverage the information from both global and local similarities, and identifies important residues and clusters of residues that are distinctive among different functional families. Our approach is based on and extend over an efficient optimization framework that we developed for protein superfamily classification. We expect that these methodological developments will not only improve the performance of state-of-the-art function prediction, but also help illuminating our understanding ofthe interplay of sequence and structure on defining functional variations among protein families. Beyond this major project, we will work on an additional project that extends the graph theoretical models for multiple sequence alignment we developed earlier to meet the challenge of domain annotation for large new sequence set. The advancement of medical research is partly based on our detailed understanding ofthe functions of genes and proteins. Our research will improve our understanding of protien evolution and function at the molecular level. Our computational approach will speed up the discovery of biological knowledge from large data sets generated by high-throughput methods.",Algorithms for protein superfamily classification and function prediction,7842935,R00RR024163,"['Algorithms', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Homologous Gene', 'Knowledge', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Theoretical model', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'design', 'improved', 'meetings', 'novel', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'structural genomics', 'tool']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R00,2009,249000,0.1272306367282275
"Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY: Over 25,000 researchers in the US and over 50,000 in 120 other countries have exploited the PredictProtein (PP) Internet server to analyze proteins by homology-transfer and by eye novo predictions of protein structure and function. Here, we propose technical and scientific solutions that will improve the functionality of PP and its extension portal META-PP. Many technical changes will remain hidden to users and are required to increase the maintainability, scalability, and portability of these servers. New Graphical User Interfaces are one proposed solution that will visibly impact the service. The scientific solutions address two related tasks pertaining to the prediction of structure and function. The first is to predict the effect of mutations. We propose the development of novel machine learning-based methods to distinguish between mutations that affect structure, function, or have no apparent phenotype. Our final method will be applied to the screening of SNP data from our experimental colleagues at Columbia, as well as to the prediction of SNP effects in public databases. The second major task is the identification of natively unstructured regions and their functional classification. Proteins that do not adopt regular structures in isolation are increasingly becoming an important research area; they may provide a key to the evolution of complexity from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. We propose the development of a machine learning-based identification of features specific to this important class of molecules. We also plan to attack the problem from a very different angle by using predictions of interaction densities inside proteins. The resulting novel tools will allow a proteome-wide analysis of the role of these molecules. All methods will be made available through PP.      RELEVANCE: Information about protein structure adds an entire dimension to protein analysis and genome annotation. This addition is often essential to infer function even for natively unstructured proteins. The PredictProtein server is unique in its combination and exploitation of evolution, structure, and function; many thousands of theoretical, experimental, and clinical researches have benefited from this. The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to improve our ability to use the evolutionary record of amino acid substitutions, i.e. to ultimately understand the amino acid ""language"". The short-term goal is to address two tasks that are closely related to human diseases, namely the distinction between silent and important mutations and the mapping of unstructured proteins onto networks and diseases.          n/a",Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein,7625220,R01LM007329,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Eukaryota', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Induced Mutation', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Point Mutation', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'portability', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,330166,0.14346841579806976
"Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein structure prediction is one of the great challenges in structural biology. The ability to accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins would bring about significant scientific advances and would facilitate finding cures and treatments for many diseases. We propose a novel computational framework for protein structure prediction. The novelty of the framework lies in its approach to conformation space search. Conformation space search is considered to be the primary bottleneck towards consistent, high-resolution prediction. The proposed approach to conformation space search represents a major conceptual shift in protein structure prediction, made possible by combining insights and algorithms from robotics and machine learning with techniques from molecular biology in an innovative manner. The key innovation comes from the insight that target-specific information can effectively guide conformation space search towards biologically relevant regions. We propose to develop a framework for protein structure prediction that achieves biological accuracy and computational efficiency by guiding conformation space search using target-specific information. The proposed framework exploits two sources of target-specific information: 1) information about the characteristics of the target's energy landscape acquired continuously during search, and 2) spatial restraints about the target's structure obtained from NMR experiments. As search progresses, the continuous integration of these sources of information will tailor conformation space search to the particular characteristics of the target. This tailored conformation space exploration can overcome the current bottleneck, yielding highly accurate and efficient structure prediction. The ability to determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins, which represent the molecular machinery inside every cell, would greatly facilitate finding cures or treatments for many diseases. This research effort will develop of a novel, efficient, and biologically accurate computational approach to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins.           n/a",Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search,7467275,R01GM076706,"['Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Muscle Rigidity', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Space Explorations', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'research study', 'restraint', 'structural biology', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2009,233457,0.17232930737767424
"Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A detailed and accurate understanding of the structure of proteins is one cornerstone of modern biomedical research, and an explicit goal of the NIH is to define the structure of all proteins either by accurate experimental determination or comparative model-building. The most successful structure prediction approaches employ empirical knowledge-based energy terms derived from features of known protein structures - most notably single-residue ???-distributions, backbone-dependent side chain rotamer preferences, and tight packing criteria. One known unrealistic feature of these prediction programs is the assumption of a fixed ideal geometry for the backbone. The driving hypothesis behind this proposal is that there exists a largely unappreciated but real, systematic, significant and pervasive variation in backbone bond angles and peptide planarity that occurs as a function of backbone torsion angles, and accounting properly for this variation will be required to achieve X-ray crystal structure quality for comparative models. The overall goal of this work is to generate accurate empirical values for this covalent variation that will lead to tangible improvements in the accuracy of structures produced by comparative modeling and de novo structure prediction as well as by X-ray crystallography. We propose to achieve this overall goal by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) to design, develop, and make available a flexibly-searchable database containing bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles for all structures known at better than 1.75 ¿ resolution (currently ~500,000 residues); 2) to use conventional query-based and modern machine learning approaches to derive accurate empirical information from the database about the systematic correlation of local conformation with variations in covalent geometry; and 3) to create a modular conformation-dependent expected covalent geometry library and to facilitate its incorporation into leading applications for comparative and crystallographic protein structure modeling. With the dramatically increased number of ultrahigh-resolution resolution crystal structures now known, the time is ripe for construction of this Protein Geometry Database that will provide facile access to a massive treasure trove of reliable and detailed empirical information about protein structure. To be done well, this work will require painstaking attention to detail and an intimate familiarity with the limitations of crystallographic refinement and the principles of protein structure. Dr. Karplus is well-suited to lead this work as he has a 20+-year track record of quality crystallographic structure determinations combined with contributions of more general insights into protein structure, among them being the pioneering characterization of the conformation-dependent variations in covalent geometry that serves as this project's foundation. Collaborations with world-leading groups in structure prediction, in crystallographic refinement and structure validation, and in knowledge-based library development ensure a rapid and effective translation of the gleaned information into improvements in protein modeling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proteins are responsible for carrying out most of the processes of life and their function depends exquisitely on their structure, even on the tiniest structural details. For this reason, determining accurate structures of proteins is a cornerstone of modern biomedical research. This work is aimed at leading to a universal improvement in the accuracy with which protein structure can be built.           n/a",Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins,7656854,R01GM083136,"['Accounting', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomedical Research', 'Catalysis', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Crystallography', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Homology Modeling', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'molecular mechanics', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics']",NIGMS,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,286440,0.23078387813502244

We will develop ways to include constraints mined from sub-atomic resolution protein structures using a new HIRES Database (to include structures with resolution < 0.85 A). These will include a structure fragment database, as well as short-range distance distributions. These data can be used to compare modeled structures against the collected data. Uses of the high resolution data will ilclude selecting higher quality fragments to replace poor quality segments in the models, for mining interaction potentials, and as a source of a variety of other high quality information regarding protein structures.

"Automated Distant Homology Modeling Meta-server The goal of this proposal is to facilitate post-genomic era research by creating a protein structure prediction meta-server for close and distant homology modeling (HM).The proposed meta-server will be a fully automated, fast, widely available, autonomous, multi-component system, aimed at significantly increasing the number of proteins that can be characterized in-silico using current methods. Currently, successful distant HM requires considerable human expertise, including the manual detection and selection of templates and of sequence-template alignments using various fold-recognition (FR) methods, the adjustment of alignments and the refinement, evaluation and selection of alternative models. We aim at automating this process, using state-of-the-art FR meta-prediction technology. We propose 5 specific aims: 1) Evaluate the performance of various top-of-the-line, autonomous FR methods in order to identify the most accurate ones; 2) Develop improved algorithms to generate more accurate FR hybrid models and to better select FR- generated sequence-template alignments; 3) Develop improved methodologies to integrate the information from the FR models and/or the selected alignments to obtain more accurate refined full-atom models; 4) Test, optimize and implement all external software in-house; and 5) Apply the meta-server to specific problems of biological, experimental interest. From the users' perspective this meta-system will facilitate accomplishing one of the goals of Structural Genomics projects, namely, to better exploit the structural information from the experimentally solved proteins in order to obtain relatively accurate computational models for the majority of the remaining proteins, including those at close and those at distant HMdistances.

"Optimization of Stuctures and Networks of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application has three major aims that exploit the use of mathematical programming tools for biophysically motivated problems. The first goal is the refinement of protein structures that are obtained from homology. Structures based on homology are rarely of atomic resolution; a resolution which is necessary for detailed modeling of protein function, and for the design of drug molecules. Based on mathematical programming approach a new class of energy functions, suitable for the refinement problem, will be designed. The second goal is to investigate a new type of network; the network of sequence flow between protein structures. We examine the process in which new sequences, generated by point mutations, remain in the current fold, or switch to other stable structures (we exclude sequences with no stable fold). The adjustments to the structure are accepted or rejected based on stability criterion. The net. work defines a master equation which makes it possible to investigate past (ancient) folds, and future structures that serve as attractors. The third aim examines the network of protein-protein (physical) interactions and will be examined with bioinformatics and biophysical approaches. Comparison will be made between the network of sequence flow and the network of protein-protein interactions to better understand the evolution of biological mechanisms and recognition.

"Mechanisms of Protein Structure Evolution    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The traditional view of protein evolution has been that all protein domains are descendents of distinct evolutionary lines, that there are a relatively small number of such lines (about 1000), and that these lines are all of relatively ancient origin. Two new bodies of evidence make that view untenable. First, analysis of sets of fully sequenced genomes shows that most protein families appear to be small, and narrowly distributed in phylogenetic space, apparently implying recent emergence. Second, analysis of the relationship between known protein structures shows that there are many more than a 1000 distinct folds, appearing to imply many more evolutionary lines. The large discrepancy between theory and fact has been clear for some time and a number of explanations have been put forward. But so far there has been no definitive study of alternatives. In this project we will systematically and quantitatively investigate four separate hypotheses, each of which may account for some share of the large number of protein folds and apparently young proteins: that these (1) are the result of generation of new open reading frames or frame shifted older ones; (2) are the outcome of extensive recombination of portions of older proteins; (3) are laterally transferred from unexplored parts of phylogenetic space; (4) are part of larger older families where there has been rapid sequence change, such that not all relatives are found. To investigate these hypotheses we will develop and extend a set of computational methods. These include methods of building protein families; reliably estimating the age of protein families, detecting lateral gene transfer effects; determining to what extent members of families are likely to have been detected with sequence methods; more quantitatively determining whether protein structures are evolutionarily related; searching for remote structure and sequence relationships; and analyzing a range of protein properties as a function of family age. We will also construct a web resource for distributing the results and soliciting extensive community annotation and discussion.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the structural and functional adaptive properties of protein molecules underpins many aspects of medicine, particularly the emergence of new viruses, drug design, and combating resistance to new therapeutics in infectious diseases.           Project Narrative Understanding the structural and functional adaptive properties of protein molecules underpins many aspects of medicine, particularly the emergence of new viruses, drug design, and combating resistance to new therapeutics in infectious diseases.",Mechanisms of Protein Structure Evolution,7583339,R01GM081511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Appearance', 'Bacteriophages', 'Calibration', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Generations', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metagenomics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Virus', 'base', 'combat', 'genome sequencing', 'member', 'novel therapeutics', 'numb protein', 'prokaryotic kingdom', 'protein folding', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MD BIOTECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE,R01,2009,110192,0.10249629165851847
"Comparative genomics of protein structure and function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work aims to develop methods to identify functional sites in protein structures and to characterize protein function on a genomic scale. The approach is predicated on the Evolutionary Trace method (ET) to locate functional sites in structures. Preliminary studies enabled us to automate the basic steps towards a complete, automated functional annotation pipeline, namely, functional site analysis with ET; extraction from ET analysis of SD-templates that describe composition and conformation of key residues involved in binding or catalytic function; the search in other structures for geometric matches to these 3D-templates; and the analysis of which of those matched are most biologically relevant.

"Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the principles that control the machinery of biomolecular systems is a computational challenge in many cases due to the involvement of macromolecular structures composed of multiple subunits and cooperative interactions manifested by allosteric changes in conformations, which are beyond the range of atomic simulations. Our goal in a recently funded R33 has been to develop and utilize low resolution models for exploring the collective dynamics of such complex systems, and bridging between structure and function, based on the paradigm structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The elastic network models and methods we introduced to this aim have found utility in many applications and helped us gain insights into the intrinsic, structure- encoded ability of proteins to favor the reconfiguration of native structures between functional substates. In the present R01, we are proposing to build on our previous work, to further explore the structure -> dynamics -> function mapping of allosteric and/or multimeric proteins using physically-based and computationally efficient models in collaboration with the NCBC Simbios at Stanford U (PI: Altman). The Simbios group has already started to construct a new simulation package, Simbody, the utility of which is expected to be significantly enhanced by a collaborative work. Our specific aims are (1) to build models and methods for automated coarse-graining of complex structures at multiple levels of resolution and assessing their collective dynamics, toward using the resulting models (structure) and data (motions) in Simbody; (2) to complement the physics-based approach developed in Aim 1 by information-theoretic approaches toward delineating signal transduction pathways/mechanisms in allosteric systems, and establishing the connection between these pathways and structural dynamics, and (3) to gain insights into the machinery of molecular chaperones, using as prototypes the bacterial chaperonin GroEL-GroES and the DnaK chaperone system, in collaboration with the Gierasch lab currently doing NIH-supported experiments for understanding the allosteric dynamics of the DnaK system. An important outcome of this project will be the establishment of a methodology for simulating the machinery of biomolecular systems on the order of Megadaltons, which will be achieved in collaboration with the Schulten lab, in addition to our partnership with the Simbios team. Project Narrative Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the dynamics or underlying molecular principles of these machines is a challenge due to the highly cooperative nature of interactions, which simultaneously involve multiple molecules. The aim of this project is twofold: to develop and implement computational models and methods to improve our understanding of the collective dynamics of proteins; and to elucidate the machinery of molecular chaperones - molecular systems that play an essential role in cellular physiology by assisting the folding and assembly/disassembly of proteins and directing them to transport and degradation pathways. These aims will be pursued in collaboration with the National Center for Biomedical Computing Simbios at Stanford U.          n/a",Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems,7556196,R01GM086238,"['Algorithms', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Cell physiology', 'Cereals', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Degradation Pathway', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hybrids', 'Information Sciences', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Machines', 'Molecular Structure', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Nature', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Statistical Mechanics', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chaperonin', 'computer framework', 'data modeling', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'intermolecular interaction', 'molecular dynamics', 'network models', 'novel', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'prototype', 'research study', 'simulation', 'structural genomics', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2009,327483,0.0908114276065361
"Machine Learning and Visualization in Structural Biology    DESCRIPTION:       This project's main objective is to develop computerized tools that assist x-ray crystallographers in rapidly determining the three-dimensional structure of a protein. More specifically, this project addresses the following task: given a 3D electron-density map from crystallography and the sequence of the protein, find the most likely layout (i.e. ""trace"") of the protein sequence in 3D. The project will create both automated methods based on statistical machine-learning and computer-vision techniques, as well as visualization tools that support humans doing this layout. These two approaches complement each other and are synergistic.      This project's first specific aim is to develop and empirically evaluate algorithms that interpret crystallographic electron-density maps. The second specific aim is to incorporate structural-biology domain knowledge (secondary-structure prediction and potential-energy calculations) into the project's algorithms for interpreting density maps. The third specific aim is to tightly integrate partial model-construction with phase estimation updates to improve the recognition of 3D protein structures in x-ray reflection data; crystallographers will be able to intervene whenever they desire to help ""steer"" this iterative process. The final specific aim is to develop intuitive and effective modalities - including virtual reality and the use of speech/audio - for the efficient use of crystallographer's time in manual model fitting and validation.      Structural biology has wide relevance to biomedicine, since protein function generally follows from protein form (i.e., its structure). This project's techniques will speed-up the process of determining protein 3D structures, especially from low-quality (i.e., low-resolution) x-ray data, and will be applicable to other structural-biology tasks. Being able to accurately interpret low-resolution data promises to allow higher through put structure determination. The broader impact will include a better understanding of the power of modern theories and algorithms in machine learning and visualization in solving biological problems.         n/a",Machine Learning and Visualization in Structural Biology,7391736,R01LM008796,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Coupling', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Engineering', 'Error Sources', 'Evaluation', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Freedom', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Object Attachment', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phase', 'Potential Energy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Right-On', 'Shapes', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'desire', 'electron density', 'improved', 'method development', 'open source', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'structural biology', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'usability', 'virtual reality']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2008,306970,0.1507983533555413
"Algorithms for protein superfamily classification and function prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  I am a postdoctoral scholar associated with Steven Brenner's lab at Berkeley, working on structural biology and computational genomics. My long-term vision is to develop new algorithms for inferring protein evolution and function from sequence and structure. Currently I am working on algorithms that can automatically classify a protein into its proper superfamily. The long-term goal of this project is to improve the accuracy of protein structure classification and function prediction.      The superfamily defines ancient protein homology. Protein superfamily classification remains a challenging task, even when 3D structure is available. Currently this task still requires experts' manual work. We believe that the classification of protein superfamilies relies on the integration of sequence information and structure information. We will employ recent breakthroughs in kernel-based machine learning approaches for combining different sources of information. We will also develop structure-based discriminative profile models for protein superfamilies. We expect these algorithmic developments will not only result in a practical tool for superfamily classification, but they will also improve our understanding of the interplay of sequence and structure on defining very remote homology.      We will extend our structure-based discriminative profile models for protein classification to function prediction. We will develop new methods for the identification of structure-sequence signatures of protein functioin. In addition, we will extend the graph theoretical models for multiple sequence alignment I developed during my Ph.D. study to meet the challenge of domain annotation for large new sequence set.      The advancement of medical research is partly based on our detailed understanding of the functions of genes and proteins. My research will improve our understanding of protein evolution and function at the molecular level.

"Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY: Over 25,000 researchers in the US and over 50,000 in 120 other countries have exploited the PredictProtein (PP) Internet server to analyze proteins by homology-transfer and by eye novo predictions of protein structure and function. Here, we propose technical and scientific solutions that will improve the functionality of PP and its extension portal META-PP. Many technical changes will remain hidden to users and are required to increase the maintainability, scalability, and portability of these servers. New Graphical User Interfaces are one proposed solution that will visibly impact the service. The scientific solutions address two related tasks pertaining to the prediction of structure and function. The first is to predict the effect of mutations. We propose the development of novel machine learning-based methods to distinguish between mutations that affect structure, function, or have no apparent phenotype. Our final method will be applied to the screening of SNP data from our experimental colleagues at Columbia, as well as to the prediction of SNP effects in public databases. The second major task is the identification of natively unstructured regions and their functional classification. Proteins that do not adopt regular structures in isolation are increasingly becoming an important research area; they may provide a key to the evolution of complexity from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. We propose the development of a machine learning-based identification of features specific to this important class of molecules. We also plan to attack the problem from a very different angle by using predictions of interaction densities inside proteins. The resulting novel tools will allow a proteome-wide analysis of the role of these molecules. All methods will be made available through PP.      RELEVANCE: Information about protein structure adds an entire dimension to protein analysis and genome annotation. This addition is often essential to infer function even for natively unstructured proteins. The PredictProtein server is unique in its combination and exploitation of evolution, structure, and function; many thousands of theoretical, experimental, and clinical researches have benefited from this. The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to improve our ability to use the evolutionary record of amino acid substitutions, i.e. to ultimately understand the amino acid ""language"". The short-term goal is to address two tasks that are closely related to human diseases, namely the distinction between silent and important mutations and the mapping of unstructured proteins onto networks and diseases.          n/a",Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein,7389563,R01LM007329,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Eukaryota', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Induced Mutation', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Numbers', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Point Mutation', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'portability', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2008,320418,0.14346841579806976
"Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A detailed and accurate understanding of the structure of proteins is one cornerstone of modern biomedical research, and an explicit goal of the NIH is to define the structure of all proteins either by accurate experimental determination or comparative model-building. The most successful structure prediction approaches employ empirical knowledge-based energy terms derived from features of known protein structures - most notably single-residue ???-distributions, backbone-dependent side chain rotamer preferences, and tight packing criteria. One known unrealistic feature of these prediction programs is the assumption of a fixed ideal geometry for the backbone. The driving hypothesis behind this proposal is that there exists a largely unappreciated but real, systematic, significant and pervasive variation in backbone bond angles and peptide planarity that occurs as a function of backbone torsion angles, and accounting properly for this variation will be required to achieve X-ray crystal structure quality for comparative models. The overall goal of this work is to generate accurate empirical values for this covalent variation that will lead to tangible improvements in the accuracy of structures produced by comparative modeling and de novo structure prediction as well as by X-ray crystallography. We propose to achieve this overall goal by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) to design, develop, and make available a flexibly-searchable database containing bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles for all structures known at better than 1.75 ¿ resolution (currently ~500,000 residues); 2) to use conventional query-based and modern machine learning approaches to derive accurate empirical information from the database about the systematic correlation of local conformation with variations in covalent geometry; and 3) to create a modular conformation-dependent expected covalent geometry library and to facilitate its incorporation into leading applications for comparative and crystallographic protein structure modeling. With the dramatically increased number of ultrahigh-resolution resolution crystal structures now known, the time is ripe for construction of this Protein Geometry Database that will provide facile access to a massive treasure trove of reliable and detailed empirical information about protein structure. To be done well, this work will require painstaking attention to detail and an intimate familiarity with the limitations of crystallographic refinement and the principles of protein structure. Dr. Karplus is well-suited to lead this work as he has a 20+-year track record of quality crystallographic structure determinations combined with contributions of more general insights into protein structure, among them being the pioneering characterization of the conformation-dependent variations in covalent geometry that serves as this project's foundation. Collaborations with world-leading groups in structure prediction, in crystallographic refinement and structure validation, and in knowledge-based library development ensure a rapid and effective translation of the gleaned information into improvements in protein modeling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proteins are responsible for carrying out most of the processes of life and their function depends exquisitely on their structure, even on the tiniest structural details. For this reason, determining accurate structures of proteins is a cornerstone of modern biomedical research. This work is aimed at leading to a universal improvement in the accuracy with which protein structure can be built.           n/a",Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins,7525973,R01GM083136,"['Accounting', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomedical Research', 'Catalysis', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Crystallography', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Homology Modeling', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Numbers', 'Object Attachment', 'Online Systems', 'Other Resources', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'falls', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'molecular mechanics', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics']",NIGMS,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,213756,0.23078387813502244
"High-Accuracy Protein Models Derived from Lower Resolution Data An outstanding international interdisciplinary team has been assembled that will bring a broad variety of expertise to bear on protein model building, bringing together researchers from chemistry, physics, computer science, mathematics, structural biology, and bioinformatics. The expertise ranges from quantum chemistry to machine learning, and from datamining to high performance computing. Input from collaborating NMR and crystallographers will be essential for validating the protein models. Improving abilities to model proteins can impact public health in important ways by enhancing our basic understanding of protein behavior and by facilitating a more efficient selection of protein targets for drug design. The overall goal is to improve a wide range of protein modeling approaches, both by developing new approaches, and by combining those previously been developed. The specific aims are to: 1) Improve existing comparative (homology) modeling and 2) Improve models obtained by fold-recognition and ab initio procedures to make them useful for molecular replacement. There will be some new methods development. Efforts are in four areas - databases, interaction potentials, conformational sampling, and optimization for combining approaches. We will develop ways to include constraints mined from sub-atomic resolution protein structures using a new HIRES Database (to include structures with resolution < 0.85 A). These will include a structure fragment database, as well as short-range distance distributions. These data can be used to compare modeled structures against the collected data. Uses of the high resolution data will ilclude selecting higher quality fragments to replace poor quality segments in the models, for mining interaction potentials, and as a source of a variety of other high quality information regarding protein structures. Better assessments of protein structural models will be developed, including the assessment of the quality of individual segments within a protein structure; the new metrics developed will be used for assessing the quality of computer-built models, crystal structures and NMR structures, and provide indicators of the expected quality of whole protein models as well as of its segments. New ways to sample protein motions will be pursued. Combining diverse methods will lead to significant gains in the computer modeling of protein structures. Extensive testing and validation will be carried out at each stage and in each part of the project to ensure large gains in model accuracy. n/a",High-Accuracy Protein Models Derived from Lower Resolution Data,7495009,R01GM081680,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'CASP6 gene', 'Carbon', 'Categories', 'Cellular biology', 'Cereals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Design', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'High Performance Computing', 'Homology Modeling', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Iowa', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Medal', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monsters', 'Motion', 'Numbers', 'Organism', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Polishes', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Torsion', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'member', 'method development', 'molecular mechanics', 'molecular modeling', 'network models', 'novel strategies', 'numb protein', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'quantum', 'quantum chemistry', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'restraint', 'scaffold', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,231555,0.18291941839274029
"Automated Distant Homology Modeling Meta-server The goal of this proposal is to facilitate post-genomic era research by creating a protein structure prediction meta-server for close and distant homology modeling (HM).The proposed meta-server will be a fully automated, fast, widely available, autonomous, multi-component system, aimed at significantly increasing the number of proteins that can be characterized in-silico using current methods. Currently, successful distant HM requires considerable human expertise, including the manual detection and selection of templates and of sequence-template alignments using various fold-recognition (FR) methods, the adjustment of alignments and the refinement, evaluation and selection of alternative models. We aim at automating this process, using state-of-the-art FR meta-prediction technology. We propose 5 specific aims: 1) Evaluate the performance of various top-of-the-line, autonomous FR methods in order to identify the most accurate ones; 2) Develop improved algorithms to generate more accurate FR hybrid models and to better select FR- generated sequence-template alignments; 3) Develop improved methodologies to integrate the information from the FR models and/or the selected alignments to obtain more accurate refined full-atom models; 4) Test, optimize and implement all external software in-house; and 5) Apply the meta-server to specific problems of biological, experimental interest. From the users' perspective this meta-system will facilitate accomplishing one of the goals of Structural Genomics projects, namely, to better exploit the structural information from the experimentally solved proteins in order to obtain relatively accurate computational models for the majority of the remaining proteins, including those at close and those at distant HMdistances.

"Optimization of Stuctures and Networks of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application has three major aims that exploit the use of mathematical programming tools for biophysically motivated problems. The first goal is the refinement of protein structures that are obtained from homology. Structures based on homology are rarely of atomic resolution; a resolution which is necessary for detailed modeling of protein function, and for the design of drug molecules. Based on mathematical programming approach a new class of energy functions, suitable for the refinement problem, will be designed. The second goal is to investigate a new type of network; the network of sequence flow between protein structures. We examine the process in which new sequences, generated by point mutations, remain in the current fold, or switch to other stable structures (we exclude sequences with no stable fold). The adjustments to the structure are accepted or rejected based on stability criterion. The net. work defines a master equation which makes it possible to investigate past (ancient) folds, and future structures that serve as attractors. The third aim examines the network of protein-protein (physical) interactions and will be examined with bioinformatics and biophysical approaches. Comparison will be made between the network of sequence flow and the network of protein-protein interactions to better understand the evolution of biological mechanisms and recognition.

"Comparative genomics of protein structure and function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work aims to develop methods to identify functional sites in protein structures and to characterize protein function on a genomic scale. The approach is predicated on the Evolutionary Trace method (ET) to locate functional sites in structures. Preliminary studies enabled us to automate the basic steps towards a complete, automated functional annotation pipeline, namely, functional site analysis with ET; extraction from ET analysis of SD-templates that describe composition and conformation of key residues involved in binding or catalytic function; the search in other structures for geometric matches to these 3D-templates; and the analysis of which of those matched are most biologically relevant. We now seek to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the annotation pipeline by optimizing the definition of 3-D templates, by adding new template features to better judge whether molecular mimicry underlies functional similarity; and by developing novel strategies that use multiple templates to identify function. The result will reveal which regions of proteins are most biologically relevant, and hence logical targets for protein engineering and drug design, and it will extend to three dimensions a functional annotation strategy traditionally based on one- dimensional pattern matching in protein sequences.

More specifically, this project addresses the following task: given a 3D electron-density map from crystallography and the sequence of the protein, find the most likely layout (i.e. ""trace"") of the protein sequence in 3D. The project will create both automated methods based on statistical machine-learning and computer-vision techniques, as well as visualization tools that support humans doing this layout. These two approaches complement each other and are synergistic.      This project's first specific aim is to develop and empirically evaluate algorithms that interpret crystallographic electron-density maps. The second specific aim is to incorporate structural-biology domain knowledge (secondary-structure prediction and potential-energy calculations) into the project's algorithms for interpreting density maps. The third specific aim is to tightly integrate partial model-construction with phase estimation updates to improve the recognition of 3D protein structures in x-ray reflection data; crystallographers will be able to intervene whenever they desire to help ""steer"" this iterative process. The final specific aim is to develop intuitive and effective modalities - including virtual reality and the use of speech/audio - for the efficient use of crystallographer's time in manual model fitting and validation.      Structural biology has wide relevance to biomedicine, since protein function generally follows from protein form (i.e., its structure). This project's techniques will speed-up the process of determining protein 3D structures, especially from low-quality (i.e., low-resolution) x-ray data, and will be applicable to other structural-biology tasks. Being able to accurately interpret low-resolution data promises to allow higher through put structure determination.

"Algorithms for protein superfamily classification and function prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  I am a postdoctoral scholar associated with Steven Brenner's lab at Berkeley, working on structural biology and computational genomics. My long-term vision is to develop new algorithms for inferring protein evolution and function from sequence and structure. Currently I am working on algorithms that can automatically classify a protein into its proper superfamily. The long-term goal of this project is to improve the accuracy of protein structure classification and function prediction.      The superfamily defines ancient protein homology. Protein superfamily classification remains a challenging task, even when 3D structure is available. Currently this task still requires experts' manual work. We believe that the classification of protein superfamilies relies on the integration of sequence information and structure information. We will employ recent breakthroughs in kernel-based machine learning approaches for combining different sources of information. We will also develop structure-based discriminative profile models for protein superfamilies. We expect these algorithmic developments will not only result in a practical tool for superfamily classification, but they will also improve our understanding of the interplay of sequence and structure on defining very remote homology.      We will extend our structure-based discriminative profile models for protein classification to function prediction. We will develop new methods for the identification of structure-sequence signatures of protein functioin. In addition, we will extend the graph theoretical models for multiple sequence alignment I developed during my Ph.D. study to meet the challenge of domain annotation for large new sequence set.      The advancement of medical research is partly based on our detailed understanding of the functions of genes and proteins. My research will improve our understanding of protein evolution and function at the molecular level.

"Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY: Over 25,000 researchers in the US and over 50,000 in 120 other countries have exploited the PredictProtein (PP) Internet server to analyze proteins by homology-transfer and by eye novo predictions of protein structure and function. Here, we propose technical and scientific solutions that will improve the functionality of PP and its extension portal META-PP. Many technical changes will remain hidden to users and are required to increase the maintainability, scalability, and portability of these servers. New Graphical User Interfaces are one proposed solution that will visibly impact the service. The scientific solutions address two related tasks pertaining to the prediction of structure and function. The first is to predict the effect of mutations. We propose the development of novel machine learning-based methods to distinguish between mutations that affect structure, function, or have no apparent phenotype. Our final method will be applied to the screening of SNP data from our experimental colleagues at Columbia, as well as to the prediction of SNP effects in public databases. The second major task is the identification of natively unstructured regions and their functional classification. Proteins that do not adopt regular structures in isolation are increasingly becoming an important research area; they may provide a key to the evolution of complexity from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. We propose the development of a machine learning-based identification of features specific to this important class of molecules. We also plan to attack the problem from a very different angle by using predictions of interaction densities inside proteins. The resulting novel tools will allow a proteome-wide analysis of the role of these molecules. All methods will be made available through PP.      RELEVANCE: Information about protein structure adds an entire dimension to protein analysis and genome annotation. This addition is often essential to infer function even for natively unstructured proteins. The PredictProtein server is unique in its combination and exploitation of evolution, structure, and function; many thousands of theoretical, experimental, and clinical researches have benefited from this. The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to improve our ability to use the evolutionary record of amino acid substitutions, i.e. to ultimately understand the amino acid ""language"". The short-term goal is to address two tasks that are closely related to human diseases, namely the distinction between silent and important mutations and the mapping of unstructured proteins onto networks and diseases.          n/a",Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein,7207482,R01LM007329,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Eukaryota', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Induced Mutation', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Numbers', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Point Mutation', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'portability', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,323192,0.14346841579806976
"Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein structure prediction is one of the great challenges in structural biology. The ability to accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins would bring about significant scientific advances and would facilitate finding cures and treatments for many diseases. We propose a novel computational framework for protein structure prediction. The novelty of the framework lies in its approach to conformation space search. Conformation space search is considered to be the primary bottleneck towards consistent, high-resolution prediction. The proposed approach to conformation space search represents a major conceptual shift in protein structure prediction, made possible by combining insights and algorithms from robotics and machine learning with techniques from molecular biology in an innovative manner. The key innovation comes from the insight that target-specific information can effectively guide conformation space search towards biologically relevant regions. We propose to develop a framework for protein structure prediction that achieves biological accuracy and computational efficiency by guiding conformation space search using target-specific information. The proposed framework exploits two sources of target-specific information: 1) information about the characteristics of the target's energy landscape acquired continuously during search, and 2) spatial restraints about the target's structure obtained from NMR experiments. As search progresses, the continuous integration of these sources of information will tailor conformation space search to the particular characteristics of the target. This tailored conformation space exploration can overcome the current bottleneck, yielding highly accurate and efficient structure prediction. The ability to determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins, which represent the molecular machinery inside every cell, would greatly facilitate finding cures or treatments for many diseases. This research effort will develop of a novel, efficient, and biologically accurate computational approach to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins.           n/a",Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search,7258945,R01GM076706,"['Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Muscle Rigidity', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Space Explorations', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'research study', 'restraint', 'structural biology', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2007,230753,0.17232930737767424
"Optimization of Folding and Threading Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Determining protein structure and function from genomic sequences and protein classification remains one of the most significant challenges in modern computational biology.  Significant enhancement to the capacity of algorithms to predict protein shapes from sequences is proposed, focusing on major bottlenecks; e.g., the folding energy and the ability of making approximate matches.  Algorithms to determine protein shapes from sequences have two major components: The first component (sampling) generates a set of plausible protein shapes; at least one of the sampled shapes is expected to be similar to the correct fold.  The second component scores the different structures and decides on the best model.  The radius of convergence of the energy function must be sufficiently large so that approximate matches will be detected as well (in threading approximate matches may include deletions and insertion).  It is therefore clear that poor scoring functions (or energies), which are unable to identify the correct fold, are likely to diminish the capacity of the folding algorithm.  At present, it is easy to generate a set of decoy (wrong) structures that will confuse existing energy functions.  Mathematical programming and machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machines) will design enhanced folding and threading potentials.  The training by these methods is automated and will lead to monotonic improvement in recognition as a function of the data size.  To more effectively cover protein space, the goal is to learn 100 million data points in a single consistent potential with (at most) 10,000 parameters.  The automated large scale learning is crucial at times in which the information on sequences and structures grows rapidly.

"High-Accuracy Protein Models Derived from Lower Resolution Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  An outstanding international interdisciplinary team has been assembled that will bring a broad variety of expertise to bear on protein model building, bringing together researchers from chemistry, physics, computer science, mathematics, structural biology, and bioinformatics. The expertise ranges from quantum chemistry to machine learning, and from data-mining to high performance computing. Input from collaborators in NMR and crystallography will be essential for validating the protein models. Improving abilities to model proteins can impact public health in important ways by enhancing our basic understanding of protein behavior and by facilitating a more efficient selection of protein targets for drug design.      The overall goal is to improve a wide range of protein modeling approaches, both by developing new approaches and by combining those previously been developed. The specific aims are to: (1) improve existing comparative (homology) modeling and (2) improve models obtained by fold recognition and ab initio procedures to make them useful for molecular replacement. There will be some new methods development. Efforts are in four areas--databases, interaction potentials, conformational sampling, and optimization for combining approaches. We will develop ways to include constraints mined from sub-atomic resolution protein structures using a new HIRES database (to include structures with resolution <0.85 A). These will include a structure fragment database, as well as short-range distance distributions. These data can be used to compare modeled structures against the collected data. Uses of the high resolution data will include selecting higher quality fragments to replace poor quality segments in the models, for mining interaction potentials, and as a source of a variety of other high quality information regarding protein structures.       Better assessments of protein structural models will be developed, including the assessment of the quality of individual segments within a protein structure; the new metrics developed will be used for assessing the quality of computer-built models, crystal structures and NMR structures, and provide indicators of the expected quality of whole protein models as well as of their segments. New ways to sample protein motions will be pursued. Combining diverse methods will lead to significant gains in the computer modeling of protein structures. Extensive testing and validation will be carried out at each stage and in each part of the project to ensure large gains in model accuracy.          n/a",High-Accuracy Protein Models Derived from Lower Resolution Data,7304272,R01GM081680,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'CASP6 gene', 'Carbon', 'Categories', 'Cellular biology', 'Cereals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Design', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'High Performance Computing', 'Homology Modeling', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Iowa', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Medal', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monsters', 'Motion', 'Numbers', 'Organism', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Polishes', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Torsion', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'member', 'method development', 'molecular mechanics', 'molecular modeling', 'network models', 'novel strategies', 'numb protein', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'quantum', 'quantum chemistry', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'restraint', 'scaffold', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,248049,0.18091843689253043
"Automated Distant Homology Modeling Meta-server    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to facilitate post-genomic era research by creating a protein structure prediction meta-server for close and distant homology modeling (HM). The proposed meta-server will be a fully automated, fast, widely available, autonomous, multi-component system, aimed at significantly increasing the number of proteins that can be characterized in-silico using current methods. Currently, successful distant HM requires considerable human expertise, including the manual detection and selection of templates and of sequence-template alignments using various fold-recognition (FR) methods, the adjustment of alignments and the refinement, evaluation and selection of alternative models. We aim at automating this process, using state-of-the-art FR meta-prediction technology. We propose 5 specific aims: 1) Evaluate the performance of various top-of-the-line, autonomous FR methods in order to identify the most accurate ones; 2) Develop improved algorithms to generate more accurate FR hybrid models and to better select FR- generated sequence-template alignments; 3) Develop improved methodologies to integrate the information from the FR models and/or the selected alignments to obtain more accurate refined full-atom models; 4) Test, optimize and implement all external software in-house; and 5) Apply the meta-server to specific problems of biological, experimental interest. From the users' perspective this meta-system will facilitate accomplishing one of the goals of Structural Genomics projects, namely, to better exploit the structural information from the experimentally solved proteins in order to obtain relatively accurate computational models for the majority of the remaining proteins, including those at close and those at distant HM distances.

"Comparative genomics of protein structure and function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work aims to develop methods to identify functional sites in protein structures and to characterize protein function on a genomic scale. The approach is predicated on the Evolutionary Trace method (ET) to locate functional sites in structures. Preliminary studies enabled us to automate the basic steps towards a complete, automated functional annotation pipeline, namely, functional site analysis with ET; extraction from ET analysis of SD-templates that describe composition and conformation of key residues involved in binding or catalytic function; the search in other structures for geometric matches to these 3D-templates; and the analysis of which of those matched are most biologically relevant. We now seek to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the annotation pipeline by optimizing the definition of 3-D templates, by adding new template features to better judge whether molecular mimicry underlies functional similarity; and by developing novel strategies that use multiple templates to identify function. The result will reveal which regions of proteins are most biologically relevant, and hence logical targets for protein engineering and drug design, and it will extend to three dimensions a functional annotation strategy traditionally based on one- dimensional pattern matching in protein sequences.

"Improve predictions of structure/function by Protein DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   PredictProtein (PP) was the first Internet server for protein structure prediction when it went online  in 1992 at EMBL. Ever since it has also been the most widely used structure prediction server. Since 1999, PredictProtein runs without financial public support at Columbia University. Limited  CPU resources, prevent us from applying the best current methods; limited human resources  prevent us from making the results more readily available to molecular biologists. PP differs from most other resources in two ways. Firstly, it tries merging a variety of tools into one single report.   Secondly, a number of methods are unique to PP, e.g. the PHD and PROF methods for predictions of secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and transmembrane helices.

"Bayesian Statistics and Algorithms for Homology Modeling   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To improve human health, a goal of the          human genome project is to translate the genome sequence into an understanding       of human biology. An important step in this process is knowledge of the              structure of human proteins and the effects of sequence polymorphisms on             structure and function. Currently, the structures of only 1000 human proteins        are known, but the structures of up to one third or so of human proteins can be      modeled based on the structures of homologous proteins in the Protein Data           Bank.

"Optimization of Folding and Threading Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Determining protein structure and function from genomic sequences and protein classification remains one of the most significant challenges in modern computational biology.  Significant enhancement to the capacity of algorithms to predict protein shapes from sequences is proposed, focusing on major bottlenecks; e.g., the folding energy and the ability of making approximate matches.  Algorithms to determine protein shapes from sequences have two major components: The first component (sampling) generates a set of plausible protein shapes; at least one of the sampled shapes is expected to be similar to the correct fold.  The second component scores the different structures and decides on the best model.  The radius of convergence of the energy function must be sufficiently large so that approximate matches will be detected as well (in threading approximate matches may include deletions and insertion).  It is therefore clear that poor scoring functions (or energies), which are unable to identify the correct fold, are likely to diminish the capacity of the folding algorithm.  At present, it is easy to generate a set of decoy (wrong) structures that will confuse existing energy functions.  Mathematical programming and machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machines) will design enhanced folding and threading potentials.  The training by these methods is automated and will lead to monotonic improvement in recognition as a function of the data size.  To more effectively cover protein space, the goal is to learn 100 million data points in a single consistent potential with (at most) 10,000 parameters.  The automated large scale learning is crucial at times in which the information on sequences and structures grows rapidly.

"Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein structure prediction is one of the great challenges in structural biology. The ability to accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins would bring about significant scientific advances and would facilitate finding cures and treatments for many diseases. We propose a novel computational framework for protein structure prediction. The novelty of the framework lies in its approach to conformation space search. Conformation space search is considered to be the primary bottleneck towards consistent, high-resolution prediction. The proposed approach to conformation space search represents a major conceptual shift in protein structure prediction, made possible by combining insights and algorithms from robotics and machine learning with techniques from molecular biology in an innovative manner. The key innovation comes from the insight that target-specific information can effectively guide conformation space search towards biologically relevant regions. We propose to develop a framework for protein structure prediction that achieves biological accuracy and computational efficiency by guiding conformation space search using target-specific information. The proposed framework exploits two sources of target-specific information: 1) information about the characteristics of the target's energy landscape acquired continuously during search, and 2) spatial restraints about the target's structure obtained from NMR experiments. As search progresses, the continuous integration of these sources of information will tailor conformation space search to the particular characteristics of the target. This tailored conformation space exploration can overcome the current bottleneck, yielding highly accurate and efficient structure prediction. The ability to determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins, which represent the molecular machinery inside every cell, would greatly facilitate finding cures or treatments for many diseases. This research effort will develop of a novel, efficient, and biologically accurate computational approach to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins.           n/a",Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search,7139225,R01GM076706,"['bioinformatics', 'chemical models', 'chemical structure', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'conformation', 'mathematical model', 'molecular biology information system', 'nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure function', 'structural biology', 'three dimensional imaging /topography']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2006,238087,0.17232930737767424

"PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central challenge in bioinformatics today is developing computational methods for predicting a protein's structure, function, and biologically relevant partners at the whole-genome level. The first two problems are well-studied, but research on determining partners for given protein sequences is just beginning. The long-term goal is to create an automated system for predicting protein-protein interactions at the whole-genome level. This proposal focuses on the coiled coil motif, whose regular and repeating structure makes it an ideal model for computational detection. Also, advances in predicting coiled coil formation have important biological and medical consequences, since the coiled coil is widespread in sequence databases (3-5%), appearing in proteins that participate in transcription, oncogenesis, cell structure, and cell fusion events. The proposed method combines experimental data, coiled coil sequence information, and statistical information from protein sequences and 3-D structures to determine partner specificity between individual helices. The method is general enough to be extended to other protein domains and thus predict other protein-protein interactions and extract functional information.   n/a",PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES,6908827,F31GM066377,"['artificial intelligence', 'computer simulation', 'mathematical model', 'model design /development', 'molecular biology information system', 'predoctoral investigator', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein sequence', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F31,2004,18979,0.12250480367289913
"EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM FOR PROTEIN STRUCTURE PREDICTION The goal of this project is to develop a computer algorithm that accurately predicts the tertiary fold of a protein given only its amino acid sequence and sparse experimental constraints or an imperfect secondary structure prediction. It will use an evolutionary optimization algorithm, a detailed atomic representation, and a proprietary method for deriving a protein energy function. The specific aims of Phase II are: (1) improve the representation of the problem; (2) improve the optimization algorithm; (3) parameterize a more accurate protein energy function; and (4) validate the prototype algorithm and energy function on a large sample of known protein structures and in blind structure prediction experiments. In Phase III the algorithm will be developed into commercial software products for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.  The long-term goal is to help satisfy the rapidly growing demand for the accurate prediction of protein structures from sequence information. This demand arises not only from the exponential growth of the database of sequences, but also from the need to understand the structure and function of newly discovered gene products known to be involved in human disease.

"NMR TECHNOLOGY FOR STRUCTURAL GENOMICS OF BREAST CANCER Genomics research is providing unprecedented access to expression vectors for thousands of proteins and it is critical to develop faster structure-determination technology to discover their cellular roles. Solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful and widely used method to determine accurate protein structures, but is also time consuming. Progress in understanding eukaryotic mechanisms of replication, transcription and translation depends critically on gaining faster access to structures of domains and proteins identified in human and other genome projects. We propose new technology for fast protein structure determination by solution state NMR. We will develop and demonstrate this technology on the 127 residue bromodomain from yeast Sth1p. Bromodomain has been chosen for its relevance to the regulation of acetylation states of histones in eukaryotic DNA. The BrD stucture will yield insights into its roles in transcription activation and repression protein complexes and should help to clarify the role of acetylation regulation in carcinogenesis. We will transfer this technology to demonstrate high throughput determination of multiple structures associated with breast cancer gene sequences in collaboration with the newly established Harvard Structural Genomics of Cancer Initiative.

Improving membrane predictions has become particularly urgent, since the recently solved high-resolution structures revealed that all existing methods were over-estimated. We hope that a combination of existing and new methods and a refinement of the respective alignments used will considerably improve prediction accuracy. To predict beta-membrane proteins, we want to explore a combination of novel prediction methods based on neural networks and similar systems with a Markovian-like model that implements the observed grammar in these proteins. As a particular example for using structural information to improve the reliability of inferring function, we propose to investigate the conservation of enzymatic activity.         n/a",Predictions of structure/function by PredictProtein,6610635,R01LM007329,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' enzyme activity', ' informatics', ' information systems', ' membrane proteins', ' protein signal sequence', ' protein structure', ' protein structure function']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2003,342656,0.11992534324350146
"PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central challenge in bioinformatics today is developing computational methods for predicting a protein's structure, function, and biologically relevant partners at the whole-genome level. The first two problems are well-studied, but research on determining partners for given protein sequences is just beginning. The long-term goal is to create an automated system for predicting protein-protein interactions at the whole-genome level. This proposal focuses on the coiled coil motif, whose regular and repeating structure makes it an ideal model for computational detection. Also, advances in predicting coiled coil formation have important biological and medical consequences, since the coiled coil is widespread in sequence databases (3-5%), appearing in proteins that participate in transcription, oncogenesis, cell structure, and cell fusion events. The proposed method combines experimental data, coiled coil sequence information, and statistical information from protein sequences and 3-D structures to determine partner specificity between individual helices. The method is general enough to be extended to other protein domains and thus predict other protein-protein interactions and extract functional information.   n/a",PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES,6607720,F31GM066377,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer simulation', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' molecular biology information system', ' predoctoral investigator', ' protein protein interaction', ' protein sequence', ' statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F31,2003,40616,0.12250480367289913
"Bayesian Statistics and Algorithms for Homology Modeling   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To improve human health, a goal of the          human genome project is to translate the genome sequence into an understanding       of human biology. An important step in this process is knowledge of the              structure of human proteins and the effects of sequence polymorphisms on             structure and function. Currently, the structures of only 1000 human proteins        are known, but the structures of up to one third or so of human proteins can be      modeled based on the structures of homologous proteins in the Protein Data           Bank. This fraction will increase rapidly due to structural genomics efforts.        Unfortunately, general principles of what works in homology modeling and what        does not have remained elusive. The reasons for this are several: 1)                 insufficient benchmarking of most prediction methods; 2) reliance on                 out-of-date statistical analysis of protein structures, performed without modem      methods of statistics: 3) most modeling methods assume a relatively high level       of sequence identity (>35 percent) between template structure and sequence to        be modeled, when most proteins of unknown structure are only distantly related       to proteins of known structure. The PI proposes benchmarking, new statistical        analysis, and new algorithms for each of the three major aspects of homology         modeling: alignment, building backbone coordinates for insertiondeletion             regions, and sidechain placement. The primary tools will be Bayesian                 statistical analysis, including hierarchical models and non-parametric methods       based on the Dirichlet process. The increase in size of the sequence and             structure databases makes the new statistical analysis timely, both because of       the increased power the new data provide, and the numerous applications              afforded by more sequences and structures.                                                                                                                                n/a",Bayesian Statistics and Algorithms for Homology Modeling,6622146,R01HG002302,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted sequence analysis', ' computer simulation', ' functional /structural genomics', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' molecular biology information system', ' molecular dynamics', ' protein sequence', ' protein structure function', ' statistics /biometry', ' transposon /insertion element']",NHGRI,INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R01,2003,252000,0.19563406016242207
"COMPUTER ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION OF PROTEIN STRUCTURE The amino acid sequence of a protein uniquely determines its tertiary structure.  Deciphering this relationship, the protein folding problem has become increasingly important to molecular biologists.  With the dramatic progress of the genome initiatives within the public and private sector and the push for a structural genomics initiative in the post-genomic era, the need for computational strategies to relate protein sequence to protein structure become even more profound.  This proposal describes new directions in our effort to improve the accuracy of protein secondary structure and to use these results and others to improve the results of threading algorithms that map new sequences onto existing structures.  We continue to be impressed by the information inherent in a family of protein sequences, especially when viewed from an evolutionary perspective.  A study of the ligand binding domain and the corresponding ligands of intranuclear hormone receptors is planned.  This effort will link computation, molecular biology and synthetic chemistry efforts to better understand this pharmacologically exciting group of molecules.  In addition, an evolutionary trace strategy is described that could lead to the identification of pairs of covarying residues within a family of aligned sequences.  Success in this arena would have important implications for threading algorithms.

"FUNCTION DIVERGENCE IN PROTEIN FAMILIES The goal of the proposed research is to study functional similarities            and differences between proteins with broadly similar structures, but            no recognizable sequence similarity. Automated structure comparison              programs, together with a new generation of fold prediction algorithms,          provide us with many examples of proteins that do, or are likely to,             belong to the same structural class.  At the same time, such broad               structural similarity may or may not be connected to any functional              similarity.  A database of protein structure and function will be built,         allowing a search for groups of proteins with certain structural and             functional features.  Such groups will then be analyzed to identify              structurally and functionally important regions in the sequence and to           match them with levels of structural and functional similarity/                  divergence.

"BIOINFORMATICS, DISORDERED PROTEINS, AND FUNCTION A major objective of bioinformatics is to predict protein structure/function from sequence; the most successful current methods use sequence homology.  These current homology-based methods explicitly or implicitly assume the paradigm sequence yields structure yields function.  Since protein function depends on flexibility, movement, or even lack of structure (disorder) in some cases, combining various motion predictions with structure predictions should improve prediction of function.  Algorithms for predicting flexibility from sequence and local disorder have been developed, as have algorithms to predict sequences that snitch between two structured states.  Sequence complexity might also be an indirect measure of mobility and still other measures could be discovered by the study of known examples.  We propose to determine the interplay of homology-based predictions that use sequence information only with explicit representations of both structure information and motion information as determined from amino acid sequence.  Structural information will be represented by helix, sheet, etc., predictions, and by hydrophobic moment calculations.  Motion information will be represented by flexibility prediction, switch sequence prediction, order / disorder prediction, sequence complexity, and new measures if any are discovered in the course of this work.  Since different functions would involve motional parameters to different extents, the plan is to apply this combined approach on a sequence family basis.  Novel comparisons, called Attribute Profiles, are proposed for the representation of structure and motion information.  Sets of Gribskov/Eisenberg 1D Profiles and associated Attribute Profiles will be combined into single predictions using neural network data models.  Prediction outcomes will be compared with experimental observations and evaluated using the jackknife method.  If successful, this work will improve prediction of protein function from amino acid sequence, which is important given the significant numbers of protein sequences with undetermined functions coming out of the various genome projects.  Motion and disorder are important pieces that need to be added to the characterization of protein structure/function.  For example, taxol has been shown recently to bind to a disordered loop in Bcl-2.  Alzheimer disease, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, Parkinson disease and infectious agents such as Staphylococcal aureus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, and (perhaps) HIV depend critically on disordered regions of protein.

"EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM FOR PROTEIN STRUCTURE PREDICTION The goal of this project is to develop a computer algorithm that accurately predicts the tertiary fold of a protein given only its amino acid sequence and sparse experimental constraints or an imperfect secondary structure prediction. It will use an evolutionary optimization algorithm, a detailed atomic representation, and a proprietary method for deriving a protein energy function. The specific aims of Phase II are: (1) improve the representation of the problem; (2) improve the optimization algorithm; (3) parameterize a more accurate protein energy function; and (4) validate the prototype algorithm and energy function on a large sample of known protein structures and in blind structure prediction experiments. In Phase III the algorithm will be developed into commercial software products for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.  The long-term goal is to help satisfy the rapidly growing demand for the accurate prediction of protein structures from sequence information. This demand arises not only from the exponential growth of the database of sequences, but also from the need to understand the structure and function of newly discovered gene products known to be involved in human disease.

"Structure based prediction of protein modifications  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genomics revolution has uncovered tens of thousands of proteins, nonetheless full exploitation of organismal genome projects will not occur without innovations in proteomics and structural biology. The agencies meeting this challenge, such as the seven NIH protein structure consortia , have targeted 10,000 new protein structures to be solved by 2010. We propose to use this powerfully enabling structural dataset as the basis for a new type of bioinformatic tool which models and compares the surfaces of proteins, instead of their sequence or backbone path, by analogy to sequence comparison methods. An algorithm that searches a protein's sw-lace features for post-translational modification and binding sites will offer a large step forward. The ability to model protein binding sites will allow investigators to predict how they interact, how regulatory networks are organized, and what determines the order of metabolic pathways--each a fundamental goal of much research. Cognia is well positioned to undertake this effort as we are currently building databases and tools designed to identify drug targets and biotherapeutic candidates for use in both basic research and pharmaceutical-biotech discovery. Our use of predictive tools to analyze, organize, and synthesize the content of databases lends direction to this proposal, and its near-term focus will involve the analysis of post-translational modifications such as the ubiquitylation and SUMOylation accomplished by E3 enzymes during the cell cycle. We anticipate that algorithms developed under this proposal will have many applications, including the ability to (I) predict novel binding interactions of structurally defined proteins (ii) identify structural homologs of proteins not apparent by sequence or backbone similarity searches (iii) define an enzyme's potential substrates, (iv) define structural features of binding sites. In Phase I, we will gather the requisite data and structures and carry out a pilot definition of an E3's consensus binding site.

"BIOINFORMATICS, DISORDERED PROTEINS, AND FUNCTION A major objective of bioinformatics is to predict protein structure/function from sequence; the most successful current methods use sequence homology.  These current homology-based methods explicitly or implicitly assume the paradigm sequence yields structure yields function.  Since protein function depends on flexibility, movement, or even lack of structure (disorder) in some cases, combining various motion predictions with structure predictions should improve prediction of function.  Algorithms for predicting flexibility from sequence and local disorder have been developed, as have algorithms to predict sequences that snitch between two structured states.  Sequence complexity might also be an indirect measure of mobility and still other measures could be discovered by the study of known examples.  We propose to determine the interplay of homology-based predictions that use sequence information only with explicit representations of both structure information and motion information as determined from amino acid sequence.  Structural information will be represented by helix, sheet, etc., predictions, and by hydrophobic moment calculations.  Motion information will be represented by flexibility prediction, switch sequence prediction, order / disorder prediction, sequence complexity, and new measures if any are discovered in the course of this work.  Since different functions would involve motional parameters to different extents, the plan is to apply this combined approach on a sequence family basis.  Novel comparisons, called Attribute Profiles, are proposed for the representation of structure and motion information.

"EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM FOR PROTEIN STRUCTURE PREDICTION The goal of this project is to develop a computer algorithm that accurately predicts the tertiary fold of a protein given only its amino acid sequence and sparse experimental constraints or an imperfect secondary structure prediction. It will use an evolutionary optimization algorithm, a detailed atomic representation, and a proprietary method for deriving a protein energy function. The specific aims of Phase II are: (1) improve the representation of the problem; (2) improve the optimization algorithm; (3) parameterize a more accurate protein energy function; and (4) validate the prototype algorithm and energy function on a large sample of known protein structures and in blind structure prediction experiments. In Phase III the algorithm will be developed into commercial software products for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.  The long-term goal is to help satisfy the rapidly growing demand for the accurate prediction of protein structures from sequence information. This demand arises not only from the exponential growth of the database of sequences, but also from the need to understand the structure and function of newly discovered gene products known to be involved in human disease.

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction Proteins play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Accurate description of protein structure is an important step towards understanding of biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics and drugs. Although experimental structure determination has been greatly improved, there is still a very large gap between the number of available protein sequences and that of solved protein structures, which can only be filled by computational prediction. The long-term goal of this project is to apply machine learning and optimization algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship by analyzing sequence, structure and functional data and to develop data-driven computational methods and tools for structure and functional prediction. We believe that by developing sophisticated algorithms to extract knowledge from the increasing sequence and structure data, we can model protein sequence-structure relationship very accurately and improve structure and functional prediction greatly. This project has already produced a few CASP-winning, widely-used data- driven algorithms and web servers (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) for protein structure modeling. This renewal will further develop machine learning (especially deep learning) algorithms for protein structure modeling without good templates. The specific aims are: (1) developing deep learning (DL) algorithms for the prediction of protein contact and distance matrix; (2) developing distance-based algorithms for fast and accurate ab initio folding of proteins without templates; (3) developing DL algorithms for template-based modeling with only weakly similar templates. This renewal will lead to further understanding and new models of protein sequence-structure relationship and yield publicly available resources for automated, accurate, quantitative analysis for a wide range of proteins. The impact will be multiplied by tens of thousands of worldwide users employing our web servers to study a wide variety of proteins relevant to basic biological research and human diseases, in both low- and high-throughput experiments. Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. This proposal develops algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure relationship and to predict protein structures.

"Building protein structure models for intermediate resolution cryo-electron microscopy maps Project Summary Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an emerging technique in structural biology, which is capable of determining three-dimensional (3D) structures of biological macromolecules. Compared to conventional structural biology techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and NMR, a major advantage of cryo-EM is its ability to solve large macromolecular assemblies. Moreover, recent technical breakthroughs in cryo-EM have enabled determination of 3D structures at nearly atomic-level resolutions. Cryo-EM will undoubtedly become a method of central importance in structural biology in the next decade. With the rapid accumulation of cryo-EM structure data, it has become crucial to develop computational methods that can effectively build and extract 3D structures of biological macromolecules from EM maps. The goal of this project is to develop computational methods for modeling both global and local structures and for interpreting 3D structures embedded in EM maps of around 4 Å to medium-resolution. Recently, we have developed a new de novo protein structure modeling method, MAINMAST, which can model protein structures from an EM density map without using existing template or fragment structures on the map. Based on the successful development of MAINMAST, we further extend the capability of MAINMAST toward more accurate modeling and for multiple-chain modeling. In addition, we will also develop novel modeling methods for medium-resolution EM maps, which combine a coarse-grained protein structure modeling technique, methods in protein structure prediction, and a low- resolution image processing approach with deep learning, a state-of-the-art powerful machine learning method. The proposed project capitalizes on the tremendous efforts and progress made in structural determination with cryo-EM by developing computational tools that allow researchers to perform efficient and reliable structure analyses for 3D EM density maps. The project will greatly facilitate investigation into the molecular mechanisms of macromolecule function by providing an efficient means of 3D structure modeling.

"Distance-based ab initio protein structure prediction Project Summary Predicting the three-dimensional structures of proteins without using known structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as templates (ab initio) remains a grand challenge of computational biology. Whereas template-based modeling is now a mature field, ab initio modeling is a comparatively nascent one, especially for large proteins with complex topologies and multiple domains. The need for advances in ab initio modeling is evident. A lot of protein sequences do not have (recognizable) templates in the PDB, and the pace of experimental structure determination is incommensurate with the scale of the problem. Herein, we propose a new approach to ab initio modeling that consists of novel deep learning architectures to predict inter- residue distances and domain boundaries as well as robust, iterative optimization methods to construct tertiary structures from the predicted distances. This project builds on the success of our current R01, particularly the outstanding performance of the Cheng group in the 2018 worldwide protein structure prediction experiment – CASP13 – where our MULTICOM suite ranked among the top three tertiary structure predictors, alongside Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold. The methods will be implemented as open-source tools for the emerging field of distance-based ab initio protein structure modeling. We will apply the methods to study protein homo-oligomers and self-assemblies, based on our novel discovery that the quaternary structure contacts within homo-oligomers can be predicted by deep learning methods from the co-evolutionary signals embedded in multiple sequence alignments of protein monomers. Furthermore, we will apply the methods to predict the folds, functional sites, superfamilies, and protein-protein interactions of proteins that contain “essential Domains of Unknown Function” (eDUFs), a group of evolutionarily conserved, essential proteins that represents an important uncharted region of protein function/fold space. The predictions for a diverse and representative subset of eDUFs will be experimentally validated through a unique collaboration with the structural biology group of Dr. Tanner. Project Narrative Three-dimensional protein structure information is indispensable in modern biomedical research, but experimental techniques will only resolve a small fraction of known proteins due to the considerable cost.

"High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important condensed phase probes of composition, structure and dynamics of biomolecules and bio-organic species. NMR observables such as chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings can be measured to very high accuracy. Because they are sensitive to the biological functional groups, detailed geometries, and chemical environments, they allow for prediction of solution phase protein structures or to identify or verify the structure of chemical compounds in the crystalline phase. The connection to structure, while true in principle, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to reveal in practice through direct assignment of the spectrum. Simulation methods that accurately predict spectral observables from structure are a key goal for NMR spectral assignment. Such methods are even more crucial for the inverse problem of realizing high quality NMR structures of folded proteins from spectra, and as powerful restraints for determining the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Existing approaches to this problem typically rely on semi-empirical heuristics, and while they have achieved considerable success, they also reveal limitations that significantly degrade the quality of structural prediction. In this equipment supplement we are proposing to acquire a dedicated compute cluster for high throughput calculations of wavefunction-based QM methods we have developed for chemical shifts that offer improved accuracy over DFT. This will be employed to populate databases that reflect protein and small molecule drug relevant for machine learning methods we have developed under NIH support. With such data, machine learning and deep networks will determine a quantitative relationship between structure and computed NMR observable, and the resulting data science driven methods will be tested on the refinement of folded proteins and small molecule drug prediction. NMR shifts and splitting measurements for organic materials containing 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei can provide detailed descriptions of the structure of drug molecules, folded proteins and their complexes, as well as the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). However there are currently limitations of turning accurate NMR measurements into accurate structures that clearly hampers advances that could be made on connecting structure to function of proteins in their native aqueous environments. This supplemental equipment proposal aims to use machine learning on QM data through the purchase of a high-throughput GPU/CPU cluster, and will significantly improve the ability to predict the chemical shifts and indirect spin-spin couplings to yield the spectrum associated with a given folded structure or drug crystal, with very high accuracy, and with good computational efficiency.",High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,10145510,U01GM121667,"['Biological', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Proteins', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'crystallinity', 'drug structure', 'functional group', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'success']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,U01,2020,150000,0.12891050559763056
"Data-driven Computational Modeling and Refinement of Protein Structures on Genomic Scales PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: A key remaining gap in our understanding of biological systems at the molecular level is how to structurally annotate the “dark” protein families—the portion of protein families unsolved by experimental structure determination techniques and inaccessible to homology modeling. Nearly a quarter of protein families are currently dark, where molecular conformation is completely unknown and this gap is likely to expand further with the rapid accumulation of new protein sequences without annotated structures. The key challenge is now how to bridge this gap to gain a comprehensive understanding of biology and disease, thereby paving the way to structure-based drug design at genomic scale. Computational protein modeling plays a key role in this effort due to its scalability and genome-wide applicability. My laboratory focuses on the development and application of novel data-driven computational modeling and refinement methods to increase accuracy and coverage of protein structure prediction on genomic scale irrespective of homology. Future research focuses on improving homology-free protein folding using multiscale de novo modeling driven by deep learning-based inter-residue interactions, enhancing low-homology threading or fold recognition by formulating new algorithms for remote template identification despite low evolutionary relatedness, and developing methods for high-resolution restrained structure refinement guided by generalized ensemble search for driving computational models to near-experimental accuracy. Proteome-wide computational modeling and refinement effort will be conducted, leveraging our unique access to large-scale supercomputing infrastructure, to build high-confidence models covering the dark protein families, which will be organized in a database for public access. This comprehensive database of structural annotations will shed light on the structures, functions, and interactions of the dark proteome, with broad implications in drug discovery and human health. Software and web servers will be freely disseminated to help worldwide community of biomedical researchers to apply these methods to their specific research problems, thus multiplying the impact of computational modeling on basic research in biology and medicine. My research program will involve close collaborations with other NIGMS-supported investigators, create training opportunities for the next generation of researchers including members from underrepresented groups, and foster future research advances in structural bioinformatics and computational biology. PROJECT NARRATIVE: A comprehensive atomic-level annotation of protein structures is essential for understanding the molecular basis of complex diseases and facilitating structure-based drug design. Lack of structural annotation of a major fraction protein universe, the so-called dark families, is a key gap in our understanding of molecular biology and diseases. This research bridges the gap by developing and applying data-driven computational modeling and refinement methods on genomic scale to predict high-quality structures covering the dark proteome, thus accelerating drug discovery leading to improved human health.",Data-driven Computational Modeling and Refinement of Protein Structures on Genomic Scales,10029150,R35GM138146,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Disease', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Play', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'Techniques', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'base', 'biological systems', 'database structure', 'deep learning', 'drug discovery', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'member', 'next generation', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein folding', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'training opportunity', 'web server']",NIGMS,AUBURN UNIVERSITY AT AUBURN,R35,2020,362119,0.13297590466753845
"Protein structure determination from low-resolution experimental data Project Abstract Determination of a protein’s three-dimensional structure is of critical importance in biology, providing insights to biological mechanisms and important targets for drug design. While high- resolution X-ray diffraction data provides an atomic view of cellular components, for many interesting and biologically relevant complexes, it may only be possible to obtain low-resolution structural information. Both cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, when applied to large, flexible molecular machines, often produce data of 3-6 Å resolution. Extracting detailed atomic information from this data, critical in understanding function, the effects of mutation, or in designing drugs is impossible due to the low number of observations and the large conformational space proteins may adopt. I propose to develop computational methods for extracting high-resolution atomic models from this low-resolution data, bridging the “resolution gap” with computational methods. My proposed research develops and extends our labs’ methods for automatically inferring atomic accuracy models, from these “near-atomic” resolution sources of experimental data. We develop novel conformational sampling methods, guided by experimental data, to infer atomic information both in cases where homologous high-resolution data is available, and where it is not. Additionally, we propose development of methods for estimating model uncertainty; these are critical in understanding to what degree structural conclusions may be made from a particular dataset. Finally, in pushing the resolution limit further, we develop general tools for biomolecular forcefield optimization. These machine-learning tools will allow development of a next-generation forcefield, critical in extending the resolution limit of data from which we can infer atomic details. The overall goal of the proposed research is robust and accessible methods to determine protein structures to atomic accuracy from only sparse experimental data. Combined, the three aims in this proposal will lead to dramatic improvements in our ability to infer atomic interactions from sparse experimental data. This will lead to determination of structures that will reveal key insights into how biomedically important protein complexes perform their function and what goes wrong in human disease.

"Towards Accurate Protein Structure Predictions with SAXS Technology (TAPESTRY) Project Summary There is an unmet need in medicine and basic sciences for accurate atomic structures of proteins. This need surpasses the capabilities of traditional high-resolution experimental methods. With machine learning advances, structure prediction algorithms are poised to provide atomic models for these areas in the near future. Yet, the gaps in prediction algorithms limit accuracy and reliability, particularly for large multi-domain proteins, protein complexes, and flexible proteins. Our proposal, Towards Accurate protein structure Predictions with SAXS TechnologY (TAPESTRY), will create technology to increase reliability and improve accuracy of protein structure predictions through experimental validation, particularly for difficult proteins. TAPESTRY is innovative by combining our strengths in high-throughput synchrotron SAXS (Small Angle X-ray Scattering) data collection and analysis with the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP), which assesses structure predictions against “gold standard”, not-yet-released crystal structures every two years. Through CASP, we take advantage of the collective protein folding knowledge of the global community of structure prediction scientists. Our approach is strategic. We provide SAXS data for CASP, giving prediction scientists access to experimental data. We develop analytical and experimental tools, designed for prediction scientists to overcome current gaps that limit the use of SAXS data. We test these tools against our TAPESTRY databases of standard proteins, with corresponding crystal structures, SAXS data, and predicted models. Finally, we evaluate the robustness of our technology through CASP and obtain an unbiased assessment of our tools and the state of the field. As a first step, we target well-folded proteins (Aim 1) and proteins with disordered tails (Aim 2) in this proposal. The feasibility of our technology proposal is supported by our current data and proofs-in-concepts, our beamline capabilities, and proven experience in SAXS analysis. We show that experimental SAXS data, which contains distance information that can act as restraints in protein structure prediction algorithms, match crystal structures of well-folded proteins and score predictions based on topological accuracy. We show cases in CASP13 (2018) when SAXS data improved the fold of predicted models. SAXS data collection is rapid (10 seconds), does not require labeling or crystallization, and is available at no cost to the scientific community. We have proven experience in developing informative and effective SAXS analytical tools. Our long-term goal is to enable biomedical researchers to input an amino acid sequence and rapidly obtain an experimentally validated and accurate atomic model(s) that reflects the protein conformation(s) in solution. If TAPESTRY is successful, the increased availability of such atomic models will have strong and broad potential to advance biomedical research and impact all areas of biology in which proteins are involved. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atomic structures are critical for medical science from understanding how proteins function to drug design. Structure prediction algorithms could provide atomic models for these purposes in the near future.

"Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes Despite rapid progress in structural bioinformatics, a rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical framework is missing in our current toolbox for analysis, classification, and organization of individual as well as groups of biomolecules. We have recently developed such a framework based on the elastic shape analysis (ESA) for the comparison of protein and RNA structures. Under this framework, the formal geodesic distance for any two protein/RNA structures can be computed rapidly. Probability distributions can also be built for families of protein/RNA structures, and can be used to classify structures in a principled way through statistical hypothesis testing. In addition, sequence information can be naturally incorporated so that comparison of structures can be conducted in the joint sequence-structure space. We have also developed novel algorithms for matching and analyzing protein surfaces. We propose to significantly further develop these methodologies for important applications in structure biology, including studying chromosome structures by combining both 30 structure and sequence level information. The proposed research will make significant contributions to the following areas: (1) This proposal will fill an important gap in structure biology - the lack of a rigorous mathematical and statistical framework for biomolecular structure comparison; (2) Our proposed unifying framework will allow natural incorporation of sequence information for structure comparison; (3) Our approach can uncover distinct clusters at the deepest level of current classification scheme (i.e. SCOP family), enabling a finer classification of biomolecular structures. Preliminary results indicate that by using carefully measured structural similarity, we will obtain representative sets of proteins of higher quality than those by current sequence similarity based methods; (4) The probabilistic models designed for protein/RNA backbone structures and surfaces will capture the flexible nature of protein structures through the use of ensemble of conformations, while maintaining high computational efficiency. These models will also enable effective characterization of family-specific variations among proteins, an important task none of the existing methods work well; (5) Protein/RNA structures will be organized using network-based data structures using probabilistic approaches. This new organization will effectively integrates sequence, backbone structure, and surface information, facilitating discovery of novel insight; and (6) these new development will be rapidly generalized for studying chromosome structures. This proposed research will allow development of tools that will also be applicable in other areas of shape analysis, including medical image analysis, computer vision, and pattern recognition. Our work will help to increase the communication between the field of protein structure analysis and the field of shape analysis, and will stimulate more cross-over development in methodology and transform research activities in both fields. Analysis, classification and organization of biomolecules are fundamental tasks essential for understanding the sequence-structure-function relationships of biomolecules. In this project, we aim to develop rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical frameworks for such tasks and apply them to study proteins, RNAs and chromosomes.",Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes,9963294,R01GM126558,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family Planning', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Grain', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Sampling', 'Set protein', 'Side', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'database structure', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'genome annotation', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'protein distribution', 'protein structure', 'shape analysis', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'tool development']",NIGMS,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,308756,0.17989491442436978
"Advanced approaches to protein structure prediction Abstract The success of genome sequencing over the last four decades has resulted in a rapidly increasing gap between the number of known protein sequences and the number of known protein structures and functions. Because protein sequence on its own cannot tell us what each molecule does in cells, the large-scale absence of protein structure and function information severely hinders the progress of contemporary biological and medical studies. These gaps in understanding strongly call for efficient computational approaches for automated, yet highly accurate protein structure prediction and function annotation. The PI’s lab has a successful track record in developing and disseminating high-quality structural bioinformatics methods which have been widely used by the global community. In this project, the lab seeks to develop new advanced methods for both tertiary and quaternary protein structure prediction. Built on the tools and databases previously developed in the PI’s lab, new deep neural-network based techniques will be extended to residue-level intra- and inter-chain contact- and distance-map predictions. These predictions will then be used to constrain the conformational searching space of threading-based fragment assembly simulations, with the aim to significantly improve the accuracy and success rate of structure modeling of monomeric proteins and protein-protein interactions (PPIs), especially for the difficult targets that lack homologous templates in the Protein Data Bank. Next, the structure and PPI network information will be used to help elucidate multiple levels of biological and biomedical functions for protein molecules, including mutation-induced changes in protein stability and human disease predictions. The long- term goals of this project are to significantly improve the state of the art of protein structure prediction and to narrow the gap between the abundance of protein sequence information and the dearth of protein structure and function data, thus significantly enhancing the usefulness and impact of structural bioinformatics. Success in this project will also help reveal the general principles governing the fundamental relations across sequence, structure and function of protein molecules. Relevance Researchers in contemporary drug industry need to use the knowledge of 3-dimensional structure of protein molecules for designing synthetic compounds to fight against human diseases. But many pharmaceutically important proteins do not have experimentally solved structures. This project seeks to develop advanced computer methods for high-quality protein structure prediction that can be used to function annotation and compound screening; these should have an important and general impact on drug discovery and human health.",Advanced approaches to protein structure prediction,9932039,R35GM136422,"['ART protein', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Drug Industry', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Induced Mutation', 'Information Networks', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Network-based', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Proteins', 'Quaternary Protein Structure', 'Research Personnel', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'base', 'data warehouse', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'fight against', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R35,2020,431776,0.22470162311366657
"MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is to develop MELD, a computational Bayesian accelerator that “melds” together molecular dynamics simulations with external knowledge. It is novel in harnessing information that has not been usable before – because it is too sparse, noisy, ambiguous, combinatoric, or too corrupted for traditional approaches. In contrast to the high-certainty restraints traditionally used in MD simulations, MELD leverages a much broader range of real-world high-uncertainty restraints. The first specific aim is to incorporate such information in protein structure determination, in several collaboration projects with experimentalists who perform solution x-ray scattering, ESR, and high-throughput alanine scanning structures of peptide protein complexes. The second aim is to also harness information about processes, trajectories, and dynamic routes to speed the identification of protein states. MELD promises to extend physics-based simulations for determining larger protein structures, for folding larger proteins, for binding more flexible ligands, and for exploring larger mechanistic actions, than current MD simulation methods can handle. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biomedical research and pharmaceutics depend on detailed understanding of the structures and motions of proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations provide the most detailed descriptions possible, however they cannot yet describe average to large sized protein structures or motions within a reasonable time frame. We propose to develop a new physics-based computational accelerator for Molecular Dynamics, called MELD, which incorporates many types of relevant external information that was too vague and difficult to compute to have been practically useful before.",MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference,9848587,R01GM125813,"['Affinity', 'Alanine', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Pharmacy (field)', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Virginia', 'base', 'blind', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'peptide structure', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'scale up', 'simulation']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2020,317007,0.13679261379419608
"High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important condensed phase probes of composition, structure and dynamics of biomolecules and bio-organic species. NMR observables such as chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings can be measured to very high accuracy, and are sensitive both to the functional groups that are present and to their detailed geometries and chemical environment. As such these NMR measurements could be used to develop protein structures with a quality equivalent to high resolution X-ray crystallography but in their native aqueous environments. The connection to structure, while true in principle, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to reveal in practice through direct assignment of the spectrum. Simulation methods that accurately predict spectral observables from structure are a key goal for spectral assignment. Such methods are even more crucial for the inverse problem of realizing high quality NMR structures of folded proteins from spectra, and as powerful restraints for determining the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Existing approaches to this problem typically rely on semi-empirical heuristics, and while they have achieved considerable success, they also reveal limitations that significantly degrade the quality of structural prediction. In this proposal, we will develop a new, first principles quantum mechanical (QM) based approach to simulation of NMR spectral observables for condensed phase biomolecules and bio-organics. Rapid prototyping of new QM methods will be enabled by the development of a distinctive in-silico NMR laboratory that applies finite magnetic fields and nuclear spins. From this capability, new methods for chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings will emerge that offer improved accuracy versus cost tradeoffs, and will be employed to populate databases that reflect protein relevant and energetically accessible environments. With such data, both artificial neural networks and Bayesian supervised learning approaches will determine a quantitative relationship between structure and computed NMR observable, and the resulting eQMCalculator will be tested on the refinement of folded proteins and creation of structural ensembles for IDPs. Project Title: High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy NMR shifts and splitting measurements for organic materials containing 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei can provide detailed descriptions of the structure of drug molecules, folded proteins and their complexes, as well as the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). However there are currently limitations of turning accurate NMR measurements into accurate structures that clearly hampers advances that could be made on connecting structure to function of proteins in their native aqueous environments. This proposal aims to significantly improve the ability to predict the chemical shifts and indirect spin-spin couplings to yield the spectrum associated with a given folded structure or IDP ensemble of structures, with very high accuracy, and with good computational efficiency.",High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,9875487,U01GM121667,"['Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Magnetism', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Phase', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Quantum Theory', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Solvents', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'aqueous', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cost', 'database structure', 'drug structure', 'experimental study', 'functional group', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'in silico', 'learning strategy', 'magnetic field', 'personalized approach', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'response', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'structured data', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'vibration']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,U01,2020,297077,0.12351118538868323
