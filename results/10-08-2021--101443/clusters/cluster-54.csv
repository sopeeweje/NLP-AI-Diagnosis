"TOPIC 389 - INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING Besides surgery, radiotherapy is the most effective treatment modality for localized prostate cancer. The success of radiotherapy stems from the exploit of a therapeutic window in tumor response and normal tissue tolerance which maximizes the chance of sterilizing the tumor while sparing the surrounding normal tissue from severe damage. This requires an accurate and individualized radiation dose distribution generated from the examination of the patient’s medical images. Radiation therapy is technically complex and labor intensive. Intensive human supervision and intervention are needed throughout the path of patient care.   Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are adept at automating workflows and tasks—in this case the development of cancer treatment plans. We believe that this machine learning has incredible potential to address inherent problems in the existing treatment planning workflow. Our approach will mitigate the current issues with treatment planning, integrate seamlessly with day-to-day operations, and will serve as a treatment solution that benefits patients in a way that limits their risk and extends their lives.   The goal of this project is to develop a start-to-end prostate cancer treatment planning system. We will work with three expert radiation oncology teams to archive existing patient data for use in training of artificial intelligence algorithms. These algorithms will enable high quality plans to be generated with ease. At the completion of Phase I, we will have a prototype interface that will allow users to create treatment plans and segmentation using artificial intelligence algorithms. Additionally, users will be able to evaluate these plans against other expert plans and against the training data. n/a",TOPIC 389 - INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING,10027492,5N91019C00053,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cancer Patient', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Pythons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'data reduction', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'response', 'stem', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'web interface']",NCI,"RADIASOFT, LLC",N43,2019,300000,-0.04504816609816857
"SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics  The current best practice guidelines for treating depression call for close monitoring of patients, and periodically adjusting treatment as needed. This project will advance personalized depression treatment by developing an innovative system, DepWatch, that leverages mobile health technologies and machine learning tools to provide clinicians objective, accurate, and timely assessment of depression symptoms to assist with their clinical decision making process. Specifically, DepWatch collects sensory data passively from smartphones and wristbands, without any user interaction, and uses simple user-friendly interfaces to collect ecological momentary assessments (EMA), medication adherence and safety related data from patients. The collected data will be fed to machine learning models to be developed in the project to provide weekly assessment of patient symptom levels and predict the trajectory of treatment response over time. The assessment and prediction results are then presented using a graphic interface to clinicians to help them make critical treatment decisions. Our project comprises two studies. Phase I collects sensory data and other data (e.g., clinical data, EMA, tolerability and safety data) from 250 adult participants with unstable depression symptomatology. The data thus collected will be used to develop and validate assessment and prediction models, which will be incorporated into DepWatch system. In Phase II, three clinicians will use DepWatch to support their clinical decision making process; a total of 50 participants under treatment by the three participating clinicians will be recruited for the study. A number of innovative machine learning techniques will be developed. These include a set of new learning formulations to construct matrix-based longitudinal predictive models, and determine the temporal contingency and the most influential features, and deep learning based data imputation methods that can handle both problems of sporadic missing data as well as missing data in an entire view. In addition, multi-task feature learning models and feature selection techniques will be expanded and refined for this challenging setting of large-scale heterogeneous data. The project is highly relevant to public and global health because it will provide a significant step forward in providing effective and patient-centric care in treating depression. It will help personalize depression treatment by identifying patients who are failing treatments early and will assist providers to take necessary actions before patients drop out of treatment.",SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics ,9758034,R01MH119678,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Drops', 'Early treatment', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Family', 'Formulation', 'Health Technology', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Sensory', 'Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'global health', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'medication safety', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2019,292411,0.04669904470650621
"Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY About 2/3 of cancer patients in US receive radiation therapy either alone or in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc. Treatment planning, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, is analogous to the design of a blueprint for building construction. If a treatment plan is poorly designed, the desired treatment outcome cannot be achieved, no matter how well other components of radiation therapy are performed. In the current clinical workflow, a treatment planner works towards a good quality plan in a trial-and-error fashion. Many rounds of consultation between the planner and physician are needed to reach a plan of physician's satisfaction, because physician's preference for a particular patient can hardly be quantified and precisely conveyed to the planner. Consequently, planning time can be up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor and can vary significantly due to varying levels of physician and planner's skills and physician-planner cooperation, etc., which substantially deteriorates treatment outcomes. For example, head and neck (H&N) cancer patients treated with suboptimal plans present 20% lower 2-year overall survival and 24% higher 2-year local-regional failure. Prolonged overall treatment process due to treatment planning reduces local-regional control rate by 12–14% per week. Furthermore, as patient's anatomy can rapidly change within the planning time, the optimally designed plan becomes inappropriate for the changed anatomy. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has made colossal advancements. We believe that AI technologies have a great potential to revolutionize treatment planning. Treatment planning consists of two major aspects: commonality and individuality. By exploiting the commonality through deep supervised learning, we can develop a treatment plan as good as those for previously treated similar patients. The individuality can be actualized by learning physician's special considerations for a particular patient using deep reinforcement learning. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated feasibility of these ideas. We hypothesize that an AI-based intelligent treatment planning system can consistently produce high-quality treatment plans with extremely high efficiency. This hypothesis will be tested using H&N cancer patients as a test bed via two aims. Aim 1, System development. Develop two deep-learning models to realize the proposed treatment planning workflow and incorporate them into a clinical environment. Aim 2, System validation. Acquire and analyze planning data before and after system implementation. The innovation of this project is the use and customization of the state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve a clinically important problem. These technologies would revolutionize treatment planning process, leading to the efficient generation of consistently high quality plans, irrespective of human skills, experiences, and communications, etc. Besides the significance demonstrated for the H&N cancer patients, the system can be easily extended to other tumor sites, yielding more substantial impacts. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal and varying quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes. This project will use and customize the state-of- the-art artificial intelligence techniques to develop an intelligent treatment planning system that is capable of efficiently and consistently generating high quality plans.",Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy,9712062,R01CA237269,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Beds', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conceptions', 'Consultations', 'Curiosities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Due Process', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Generations', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individuality', 'Intelligence', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'design', 'experience', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'negative affect', 'optimal treatments', 'population based', 'preference', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,584676,0.05079818597518798
"An Automated Patient Chart Error Detection System for Radiation Therapy Project Summary/Abstract Every year, approximately 1,200 severe mistreatments happen in radiation therapy. Radiation therapy lawsuits rank in the top third of all medical specialties with an average of $313,000 per claim settled or litigated. The current method for detecting treatment errors is by a weekly patient chart check, where each treatment record is manually reviewed on a weekly basis. This labor-intensive and inefficient method prevents us from detecting the treatment error at an early stage. Here we propose a novel software system, ChartAlert, for automating patient chart checking. ChartAlert is a prospective real-time adaptive electronic checking system that can be configured to support different clinical workflows and perform “smart” check using artificial intelligence. It supports two major treatment databases (Elekta MOSAIQ and Varian ARIA) in radiotherapy. In Phase I project, we have successfully developed ChartAlert for MOSAIQ prototype that is under clinical testing in two treatment centers. Our preliminary results demonstrated the significant improvement of effectiveness in patient chart checking and the flexibility of supporting different workflows. In this Phase II proposal, we will continue the ChartAlert development. We will demonstrate the feasibility of the ChartAlert approach and its advantages over the standard manual checking method. We will develop a prospective checking module, develop the ARIA data translation module for ChartAlert for ARIA, design and implement an AI-based “smart” check module, and verify the proposed system at the partner sites. Successful completion of these aims will demonstrate the feasibility and commercial potential of the ChartAlert approach. Ultimately, this work will result in an intelligent patient chart checking software, which will increase patient chart check efficiency, save staff time, improve cancer patient treatment safety, and preventing potential lawsuits. Project Narrative Treatment errors in radiation oncology occur at a rate of 2% per patient, and radiation therapy lawsuits rank in the top third of all medical specialties with regard to claims made, claims paid, and damages. Current methods of detecting treatment errors are manual and inefficient. There is a critical need for efficient treatment error detection in order to improve patient safety and save cost. We propose to develop a scalable and comprehensive software system (ChartAlert) for automated patient chart error detection in radiation therapy. ChartAlert can be extended to other types of patient charts to check treatment and prescription consistency and improve patient safety.",An Automated Patient Chart Error Detection System for Radiation Therapy,9845105,R42CA195819,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Innovation Corps', 'Insurance', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Methods', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Records', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Framework', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'base', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'maltreatment', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'research clinical testing', 'software development', 'software systems', 'success', 'treatment center', 'treatment planning', 'treatment site', 'tumor']",NCI,"INFONDRIAN, LLC",R42,2019,894987,0.033743851511285367
"Toward Precision Medicine for Substance Use Disorders with Co-Occurring PTSD - A Machine Learning Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over 20 years of empirical data document the individual and societal costs of co-occurring substance use disorders (SUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although evidence-based treatments are available for SUD+PTSD, the lack of methods or guidelines for personalized treatment recommendations represents a critical barrier to progress in the field. Secondary analyses of existing treatment research datasets have the promise to identify cost-effective and noninvasive variables that represent predictors, moderators, mediators, mechanisms of action, and secondary effects in a way that can be easily replicated in research and expanded to the real world. Importantly, extant datasets provide an opportunity to develop and test innovative analytic approaches that leverage technological advances in computing power to: 1) develop precision medicine algorithms that can prognosticate and prescribe at the patient-level, 2) generate new hypotheses to guide future research on treatment development and dissemination, and 3) innovate existing methods that can be applied to solve related problems in the field. Accordingly, the proposed project will apply machine learning methodologies to the largest existing NIDA-funded multi-site clinical trial for SUD+PTSD in order to: Aim 1: Develop algorithms that can identify the probability of treatment response on both SUD and PTSD outcomes based on routinely collected intake data. Aim 2: Identify key variables associated with a significant increase or decrease in the treatment response probability. Aim 3: Assess the feasibility of providing data-driven, personalized prescriptions that fit patients to the treatment most likely to benefit them based on their individual profile. The proposed machine learning analyses will be developed by the applicant at the Anxiety and Health Behaviors Laboratory of The University of Texas at Austin, and evaluated at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), which houses the fastest academic supercomputer in the United States of America, and one of the most powerful systems in the world. Importantly, the algorithms (once developed) can be easily disseminated and do not require powerful hardware to execute. Therefore, the combination of advanced machine learning analyses and high-performance computing has the promise to provide methods and findings that can be expanded across extant datasets and future research projects to facilitate scientific discovery in the field of personalized medicine for addiction that: 1) goes beyond comparing mean response across treatments, and 2) that is otherwise not possible with traditional statistical methods. If successful, the project will support a strategy that represents a paradigm shift from one-size-fits-all recommendations derived from treatment comparisons in clinical trials, to a data-driven, precision medicine approach that prognosticates and prescribes at the patient level. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will apply machine learning methodologies to the largest existing NIDA-funded multi-site clinical trial for substance use disorders (SUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). If the project is successful, it will be the first to: 1) develop algorithms that can identify the probability of treatment response on both SUD and PTSD outcomes based on routinely collected intake data, 2) identify key variables associated with a significant increase or decrease in the probability for treatment response, and 3) assess the feasibility of providing data-driven prescriptions that fit patients to the treatment most likely to benefit them based on their individual profile.",Toward Precision Medicine for Substance Use Disorders with Co-Occurring PTSD - A Machine Learning Approach,9809511,R36DA049122,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Anxiety', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intake', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Probability', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'addiction', 'analytical method', 'anxiety treatment', 'austin', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'profiles in patients', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'simulation', 'societal costs', 'suicidal risk', 'supercomputer', 'symposium', 'therapy development', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R36,2019,49534,0.03940622881309418
"Using Causal Inference and Machine Learning Methods to Predict Cognitive Behavioral Treatment Response PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many patients with anxiety and fear disorders (AFDs) report minimal benefits when treated with an evidence- based psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]) or pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants; benzodiazepines). Conversely, some AFD patients are likely to benefit from virtually any treatment (e.g., supportive therapy). Using data collected in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), there has been limited progress determining how to use pre-treatment characteristics to match AFD patients to the treatment that is most likely to provide benefit. As a result, NIMH has forwarded Strategic Objectives focused on identifying treatment moderators and developing tools that predict differential treatment response. The broad goal of this proposed secondary data analysis is to apply causal inference and machine learning methods to prospective observational data to predict differential treatment response among patients with AFDs. The sample (n = 1,528) is from a longstanding NIMH-funded study of AFD patients who received: (a) CBT with concurrent pharmacotherapy, (b) CBT without pharmacotherapy, or (c) treatment as usual (TAU). Targeted maximum likelihood estimation (a causal inference method) and super learning (an ensemble machine learning method) will be used to accomplish the proposed Aims. Aim 1 will estimate the (overall) average effects of the three treatment types. Aim 2 will estimate “optimal treatment rules” to determine if differential treatment response can be meaningfully predicted based on a patient's multidimensional profile of pre-treatment symptoms. Aim 3 will estimate “optimal treatment rules” to determine if differential treatment response can be meaningfully predicted using all available pre-treatment covariates. The proposed study is highly innovative and could significantly impact the growing literature focused on predicting differential treatment effects and personalizing treatment for patients with AFDs. Although treatment effects estimates obtained using observational data and causal inference methods (i.e., adjusted for nonrandom treatment selection) are similar to those estimated in RCTs, this would be the first study to apply such methods to AFD patient data. This study will also be the first to use ensemble machine learning to develop composite moderators for AFDs (i.e., optimal treatment rules). In comparison, prior attempts to develop composite moderators have relied on less flexible model-building procedures prone to overfitting and unable to capture complex predictor-outcome associations (e.g., interactions among predictors; nonlinear associations). In achieving the proposed Aims, the current study would be a catalyst for future research using causal inference and machine learning to study predictors of differential treatment response among AFD patients. Results will be used to justify future research aimed at expanding and validating the models in larger observational samples and pragmatic RCTs (e.g., optimal treatment rules for specific medications/doses; timing of pharmacotherapy relative to CBT; second-wave CBT versus acceptance-based CBT). PROJECT NARRATIVE Some patients with anxiety and fear disorders may benefit only from certain evidence-based treatments, while others may benefit from virtually any treatment (e.g., talk therapy). The current study will use casual inference and machine learning methods to develop predictive models that identify the treatment(s) most likely to benefit a particular patient. The models developed in this study will serve as an important initial step toward efficient and personalized treatment for patients with anxiety and fear disorders.",Using Causal Inference and Machine Learning Methods to Predict Cognitive Behavioral Treatment Response,9724776,R21MH119492,"['Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Assessment tool', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life Stress', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Onset of illness', 'Outpatients', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Procedures', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Severities', 'Supportive care', 'Symptoms', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'anxiety treatment', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'excessive anxiety', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'model building', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'sociodemographics', 'stress reactivity', 'symptom treatment', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment disparity', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'virtual']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2019,265477,0.08431550559889499
"Mechanistic Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to combine empirical data with mechanistic physiologic knowledge to produce personalized, quantitative predictions that can lead to improved treatments. In normal practice, physicians reason by analogy from generic physiologic principles, but the technology exists to exploit even imperfect physiologic models make treatment personalized and quantitatively grounded in physiology, and to improve learning from empirical data. We will apply data assimilation (DA), mechanistic mathematical modeling, machine learning, and control theory, which have revolutionized space travel, weather forecasting, transportation and flight, and manufacturing. Data assimilation and control theory have seen very limited use in medicine, usually applied in data-rich circumstances like continuous glucose monitoring or packemakers. Our previous work demonstrated use of data assimilation with glucose-insulin models to predict glucose in the outpatient type 2 diabetes setting. We will extend data assimilation and control theory using, for example, a constrained ensemble Kalman filter and an offline Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, to better handle sparse, short training sets on rapidly changing patients, and we will apply it in the setting of glucose management in the intensive care unit (ICU). Moreover, we will develop DA for phenotyping applications by exploiting the parameter estimation capabilities of DA. Data assimilation can be used to estimate measureable and unmeasureable physiologic states and parameters, and we will use these estimates to create higher definition phenotypes. While we are focusing on glucose management in the ICU, we will develop methods that are likely to generalize, beginning the effort to develop DA in the context of healthcare more broadly. The work we propose is a necessary step toward being able to use mechanism-driven DA to test, validate and optimize personalized short-term treatment strategies, long-term health forecasts, and mechanistic physiologic understanding. We will carry out the following aims: AIM 1—forecast—extend the DA methodology to allow forecasting, personalization, model evaluation, and model selection in the ICU context, relating treatment input to physiologic outcome; AIM 2—phenotype—extend the DA framework to state and parameter estimation to allow for mechanism-based phenotyping, careful uncertainty quantification, and inference of difficult or impossible-to-measure physiology; AIM 3—control—extend the DA to include a controller that begins with desired clinical outcomes, e.g., glucose range, and estimates the inputs, e.g., insulin or nutrition, required to achieve the outcomes. Narrative The goal of this project is to develop better ways to combine data about individual patients with knowledge about physiology to create personalized forecasts and recommendations about a patient's health. We specifically address the management of glucose in the intensive care unit, an area of high importance that could benefit from improved forecasts and recommendations.",Mechanistic Machine Learning,9767278,R01LM012734,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Assimilations', 'Carbohydrates', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Depressed mood', 'Early Intervention', 'Eating', 'Endocrine Physiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fingers', 'Food', 'Future', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatic', 'Hour', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minor Planets', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Power Plants', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Renal function', 'Running', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'Validity of Results', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'control theory', 'fly', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose production', 'health record', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'insulin secretion', 'interstitial', 'mathematical model', 'nutrition', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized learning', 'personalized medicine', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'reduced food intake', 'space travel', 'treatment strategy']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2019,660597,0.017130419608977005
"Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone and the Adaptive Treatment for Cocaine Dependence trials, sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for alcohol or/and cocaine dependent patients. One of the main challenges in these trials is the high rate of noncompliance to the assigned treatments. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal ATS is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Existing methods in analyzing SMART data are limited to intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. That is the treatment effect at each stage is estimated based on the treatment group to which an individual was randomized at that stage regardless of whether the individual complied with their assigned treatment. One major concern is that the relationship between the experimental manipulation and the outcome may be confounded by treatment noncompliance. We develop methodologies that can be used to adjust for noncompliance in analyzing data collected in SMARTs. Specifically, we extend the principal strata framework and Bayesian Copulas to multi-stage randomized trials setting and propose novel procedures that estimate the mean outcome under different ATSs. We also propose a novel Bayesian machine learning approach that can be used to construct deeply tailored (i.e., individualized) treatment strategies that take into account patients' demographic factors, measures of mental health and alcohol use, obsessive-compulsive drinking and alcohol craving scales, physical composite scores. Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available open-source software leveraging the R and Python languages that implements our methods. This will provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal ATSs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for analysis of sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) data in the presence of partial compliance. The methods developed in this project will improve the usefulness, interpretability and generalizability of the results obtained by SMARTs and help mental health and substance use disorder scientists to develop more potent adaptive treatment strategies to guide the individualization of mental health and substance use disorder treatments.","Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance",9734801,R01DA048764,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian learning', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol craving', 'arm', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'non-compliance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient response', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'virtual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2019,422197,0.01469827668242322
"Automatic Thoracic Organ Segmentation Tool for Radiation Treatment Planning of Cancers in Thoracic Region ABSTRACT As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention. Cancers in the thoracic region, which include lung, esophageal, thymus, mesothelioma and breast cancers, are among the most pervasive and deadly cancers. The protection of normal thoracic organs including lungs, heart, esophagus and spinal cord is critical in reducing long term toxicity in such cancers. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to such organs-at-risk (OARs), they are required to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans during radiation treatment planning to get an accurate dosage distribution. Despite tremendous effort into the development of semi- or fully-automatic segmentation solutions, current automated segmentation software, mostly using the atlas-based methods, has not yet reached the level of accuracy and robustness required for clinical usage. Therefore, in current practice, significant manual efforts are still required in the OAR segmentation process. Manual contouring suffers from inter- and intra-observer variability as well as institutional variability where different sites adopt distinct contouring atlases and labeling criteria and thus leads to inaccuracy and variability in OAR segmentation. When OARs are very close to the treatment target, segmentation errors as small as a few millimeters can have a statistically significant impact on dosimetry distribution and outcome. In addition, it is also costly and time consuming as it can take 1-2 hours of a clinicians’ time to segment major thoracic organs due to the large number of axial slices required. The associated human efforts would significantly increase if adaptive radiation therapy (ART) is used as OARs from two or more simulation CT scans need to be segmented to adjust treatment plans. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning methods has revolutionized many computer-vision areas and the adoption of deep learning in medical applications has shown great success. Based on a deep-learning-based algorithm we developed that achieved better-than-human performance and ranked 1st in 2017 American Association of Physicist in Medicine Thoracic Auto-segmentation Challenge, a thoracic OAR auto-segmentation product will be developed in this project with the two aims: 1) improve and validate the deep-learning-based automatic thoracic organ segmentation algorithm on a larger clinical data set, and 2) incorporate this algorithm into a preliminary product that fits into the clinical workflow. With this product, the segmentation accuracy can be improved, leading to more robust treatment plans in protecting normal organs and improved long term patient outcome. Furthermore, the time and cost of radiation treatment planning can be greatly reduced, contributing to a more affordable cancer treatment and reduced healthcare burden. NARRATIVE As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to such organs-at-risk (OARs), they are required to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans. A deep-learning-based thoracic OAR auto-segmentation product developed in this project can improve the segmentation accuracy and reduce the time and cost of radiation treatment planning as compared with the current manual process, leading to improved long term patient outcome and reduced cancer treatment cost.",Automatic Thoracic Organ Segmentation Tool for Radiation Treatment Planning of Cancers in Thoracic Region,9776272,R43EB027523,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chest', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Esophageal', 'Esophagus', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Kentucky', 'Label', 'Lung', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mesothelioma', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Spinal Cord', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Thymus Gland', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'dosage', 'dosimetry', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'millimeter', 'novel', 'prototype', 'satisfaction', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIBIB,"CARINA MEDICAL, LLC",R43,2019,299288,0.0006002787471652007
"Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics The complex environment of modern radiation therapy (RT) comprises data from a rich combination of patient- specific information including: demographics, physical characteristics of high-energy dose, features subsequent to repeated application of image-guidance (radiomics), and biological markers (genomics, proteomics, etc.), generated before and/or over a treatment period that can span few days to several weeks. Rapid growth of these available and untapped “pan-Omics” data, invites ample opportunities for Big data analytics to deliver on the promise of personalized medicine in RT. This particularly true in promising but high-risk RT procedures such as stereotactic body RT (SBRT), which have witnessed tremendous expansion due to clinical successes in early disease stages and socio-economic benefits of shortened high dose treatments. This has led to the desire to exploit these treatments into more advanced stages of cancer, however, the unknown risks associated with increased toxicities hamper its potential. Therefore, robust clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) capable of exploring the complex pan-Omics interaction landscape with the goal of exploiting known principles of treatment response before and during the course of fractionated RT are urgently needed. The long-term goal of this project is to overcome barriers related to prediction uncertainties and human-computer interactions, which are currently limiting the ability to make personalized clinical decisions for real-time response-based adaptation in radiotherapy from available data. To meet this need and overcome current challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team including: clinicians, medical physicists, data scientists, and human factor experts. Specifically, we will develop and quantitively evaluate: (1) graph-based supervised machine learning algorithms for robust prediction outcomes before and during RT; (2) deep reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize treatment adaptation; and (3) a user-centered software prototype for RT decision support, with the broader goal of building a comprehensive real-time framework for outcome modeling and response-based adaption in RT. We hypothesize that the use of advanced machine learning techniques and user-centered tools will unlock the potentials to move from current population-based approaches limited by subjective experiences and heuristic rules into robust, patient-specific, user-friendly CDSSs. This approach and its corresponding software tool will be tested within two clinical RT sites of lung and liver cancers, to demonstrate its versatility and highlight pertinent human-computer factors and cancer specific issues. Impact statement: Patient-specific big data are now available before and/or during RT courses, offering new and untapped opportunities for personalized treatment. This study will overcome current shortcomings of population-based approaches and data underuse in current RT practice by investigating and developing an intelligent, computer-aided, user-centered, personalized CDSS and test its performance in rewarding but high- risk RT scenarios. The approach is also applicable to other modern cancer regimens. With the wide variety of treatment prescription options in radiation therapy, physicians and patients need to weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment; these treatments are delivered over multiple treatment sessions where additional patient-specific data become available. Clinical decision support can play a pivotal role in deliberations related to response-based adaptation of treatment. Therefore, we are exploring and benchmarking large-scale adaptive machine learning methods for building a robust decision support system tool in terms of efficacy, human-computer factors, and the ability to handle large data uncertainties for clinical practice in the complex but promising environment of high dose radiation treatment of lung and liver cancers as case studies.",Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics,9816658,R01CA233487,"['Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Network', 'Bedside Testings', 'Benchmarking', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose Fractionation', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hostage', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reaction Time', 'Regimen', 'Regrets', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computer human interaction', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'demographics', 'experience', 'heuristics', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'irradiation', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'radiation risk', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'side effect', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment duration', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,451307,0.040855791555405044
"An artificial intelligence-driven distributed stereotactic radiosurgery strategy for multiple brain metastases management PROJECT SUMMARY Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive decline and design strategies to preserve patients’ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care. To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI- based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality, patients’ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow. In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The project’s innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI tools’ performance through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with multiple brain metastases, a cancer which has spread to multiple places in the brain, have poor survival or quality of life after single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy. We will develop and study a new treatment strategy for multiple brain metastases using spatial and temporal fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery by frameless GammaKnife.

"Statistical and Machine Learning Methods for Integrating Clinical and Multimodal Imaging Data to Select Optimal Antidepressant Treatment Summary: The public health burden of major depressive disorder (MDD) is immense and current approaches for selecting antidepressant treatment have had limited success. By some estimates, fewer than one in three MDD patients will respond to their prescribed antidepressant and the quest for a treatment that will work is typically characterized by a lengthy course of trial-and-error. The need to identify patient characteristics (biomarkers) that can be used to objectively select personalized antidepressant treatment is clear. Accordingly, large clinical studies like the NIMH-funded Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) study have collected massive amounts of baseline measures including those from various neuroimaging sources in the hope that some can be used to guide antidepressant treatment selection. These data bring with them many statistical challenges that have yet to be effectively addressed. These challenges include (1) dealing with high-dimensionality, (2) handling data missingness, and (3) determining how best to simultaneously model relationships between measures from multiple imaging modalities and the response of interest. The goal of this project is to acquire the essential training and experience to make significant progress in this area by addressing each of these challenges. Aim 1 of this project will employ state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning algorithms and targeted estimation to identify moderators of antidepressant treatment effect using scalar clinical, demographic, and summary neuroimaging data from clinical trials of antidepressant treatments, including EMBARC. Strategies for handling missing data in this context will also be investigated and guidelines on best practices will be proposed. Aim 2 will extend the methods used in Aim 1 and develop user-friendly software to directly incorporate high- dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data into treatment decision rules. Included in this aim will be an investigation into best practices for handling missing high-dimensional imaging data in the context of estimating treatment decision rules. Aim 3 will employ the novel methods developed in Aim 2 and the estimated treatment decision rules will be evaluated and compared with those developed in Aim 1. I have put together a training program that directly supports the completion of these research aims. It includes instruction, mentoring, and hands-on-experience (1) in psychopathology and the neural basis for psychiatric disorders and treatment for those disorders; (2) in the use of neuroimaging data to understand depression and response to antidepressant treatment; (3) in the use of modern algorithms to store, process, manipulate, and analyze big biomedical data like those arising in multimodal neuroimaging studies. This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the training, time, and resources to be able to make substantial progress in addressing this important problem and will provide the skills and experience that will be crucial in my transition to an independent investigator. Public Health Relevance Statement: This proposal seeks to advance precision medicine through the development of new statistical methods that integrate clinical, demographic, and high-dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data to estimate treatment decision rules. The proposed research and training are laid out in the context of depression but the statistical tools to be developed will be general enough for constructing treatment decision rules for a wide array of diseases using a variety of data types. These statistical tools have the potential to reduce the burden of diseases like depression by providing personalized treatment that has the best chance for success.",Statistical and Machine Learning Methods for Integrating Clinical and Multimodal Imaging Data to Select Optimal Antidepressant Treatment,9785626,K01MH113850,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroencephalography', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Instruction', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sertraline', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'Writing', 'big biomedical data', 'biosignature', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'data reduction', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging modality', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,158696,0.06631404389688374
"Personalized Statin Treatment Plan to Optimize Clinical Outcomes Using Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY An estimated 47% of Americans 65 years of age and older take statins, which are highly effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and reducing all-cause mortality. Unfortunately, ~50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain these critical benefits because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation. There, Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with ASCVD. In clinical practice, statin-associated symptoms (SAS) often result in dose reduction or discontinuation of these life-saving medications. Currently, physicians employ reactive strategies to manage SAS concerns after they manifest, such as offering an alternative statin treatment plan (e.g., reducing dosage or changing medication) or a `statin holiday'. However, with numerous statin treatment strategies available and no means of optimizing their match to a given patient, physician decision-making is based on minimal patient data elements. Moreover, using a single patient's data to identify the optimal statin regimen and treatment plan is inadequate to ensure that the harms of statin use are minimized and the benefits are maximized. A decision- support system, by contrast, can use a vast number of variables from a large number of patients (“big data”) to match an optimal statin treatment plan to an individual patient prospectively. We propose to use complex patient information to develop and test an effective predictive model and tool, the personalized statin treatment plan (PSTP) platform, which could be used by physicians to optimize personalized statin treatment to minimize harms (SAS and statin discontinuation) while at the same time maximizing benefits (LDL reduction). The proposed study leverages data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (which includes more than 20 years of insurance claims and electronic health records data from more than 150 million patients across the United States), as well as clinical trial simulations, for model development, validation, and evaluation. We will address the following specific aims: 1) Develop and validate a deep-learning model to predict both SAS and statin discontinuation using linked insurance claims and EHR data; 2) Develop and validate the PSTP platform to identify statin treatment plans that optimize both LDL reduction (benefit) and SAS and statin discontinuation (harm) for a given patient profile; and 3) Evaluate the PSTP relative to current and guideline-driven practices using CTS to assess clinical benefits and harms. The proposed study will produce a precision-medicine tool to empower physicians to make proactive clinical decisions regarding statin treatment planning (i.e., selecting the statin drug and dosage optimized for a particular patient to maximize LDL reduction and minimize statin discontinuation and SAS) before any statin is prescribed. The implementation of such a tool would substantially improve public health by reducing statin discontinuation and sub-optimal clinical outcomes inherent in current reactive statin-prescribing strategies based on non-personalized statin treatment plans. PROJECT NARRATIVE About 50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain critical benefits in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and reducing all-cause mortality because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation largely due to statin-associated symptoms.

"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders.

"Therapeutic Approaches to Dysarthria:  Acoustic and Perceptual Correlates ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 90% of the 1.5 million Americans living with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and 50% of the 500,000 Americans living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) will experience dysarthria. Dysarthria has devastating consequences for life quality and participation in society due to its effects on employment, leisure activities and social relationships. Knowledge of therapy techniques for maximizing perceived speech adequacy, as indexed by the gold standard perceptual construct of intelligibility is thus of vital importance. Owing to the scarcity of impartial comparative studies, the choice of one technique over others is often based on trial and error or reflects clinician bias, both of which are at odds with evidence-based practice. This project has sought to address this critical gap in knowledge regarding the comparative merits of dysarthria treatment techniques since its inception. Toward this end, published studies from the past funding cycle compared the acoustic and perceptual merits of three common, global dysarthria treatment techniques including 1) rate manipulation, 2) an increased vocal intensity and 3) clear speech in MS and PD as well as age and sex matched neurotypical talkers. Global treatment techniques by their very nature elicit co-occurring acoustic changes (e.g., duration, segmental articulation). Because an explanatory, acoustically-based model of intelligibility is lacking, the acoustic change(s) causing or explainin the improved perceptual outcomes of global treatment techniques are unknown. Determining the acoustic variables explaining intelligibility variation in dysarthria would not only tremendousy advance theoretical understanding of intelligibility but also would strengthen the scientific basis for treatment. Treatment focused on those acoustic variables explanatory for improved intelligibility may further accelerate progress in therapy. Importantly, research from the previous funding cycle suggests the promise of speech analysis-resynthesis for identifying segmental and suprasegmental acoustic variables explanatory for intelligibility in dysarthria. Building upon this work, the overarching goal of the continuation is to contribute towards development of an acoustically-based explanatory model of intelligibility. Our approach 1) employs established perceptual procedures and acoustic measures, 2) uses an innovative analysis-resynthesis technique that permits conclusions concerning the explanatory relationship between acoustic changes accompanying dysarthria therapy techniques and intelligibility, and 3) leverages methods from machine learning to build a predictive model of intelligibility from acoustics. The impact of this work is in its contribution to 1) advancing conceptual understanding of intelligibility, 2) strengthening the scientific basis for treatment, and 3) optimizing clinical implementation of dysarthria therapy techniques. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is directly relevant to the mission of NIDCD due to its focus on investigating the therapeutic techniques for maximizing intelligibility in dysarthra secondary to Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis. By advancing conceptual understanding of intelligibility, this research will strengthen the scientific basis for dysarthria treatments and will optimize their clinical implementation.",Therapeutic Approaches to Dysarthria:  Acoustic and Perceptual Correlates,9766229,R01DC004689,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Articulation', 'Comparative Study', 'Development', 'Dysarthria', 'Employment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Idiopathic Parkinson Disease', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Leisure Activities', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clear speech', 'clinical implementation', 'comparative', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment program']",NIDCD,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2019,517281,-0.0014407719690646195
"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival.

"High-Resolution Inference for Correlates of Vaccine Protection Project Summary/Abstract Statisticians play in a key role in quantifying the uncertainty in ﬁndings from clinical trials, observational studies, and other data sources, thereby enabling rational decision making based on the ﬁndings and protecting against the human tendency to see signal in noise. Ideally the validity of the uncertainty quantiﬁcation, also known as statistical inference, will be agnostic in the sense that it avoids reliance on implausible assumptions, thereby improving the interpretability and credibility of the resulting ﬁnd- ings. There has been much progress over the last several decades in obtaining agnostic inference of population-level quantities, such as (i) the percent reduction in infection in vaccinees compared to place- bos or (ii) the average treatment effect if the entire population receives treatment versus control. There has been relatively little progress, on the other hand, in obtaining agnostic inference of higher-resolution quantities, such as (i) the percent reduction in the probability of infection in vaccinees compared to place- bos, conditional on a continuous measure of immune response or (ii) the average treatment effect for an individual based on a high-dimensional set of observed covariates. These high-resolution quantities are function-valued in the sense that they are respectively deﬁned as functions of immune response and subject covariates. While inference for high-resolution quantities can be obtained when one is willing to commit to strong assumptions on the observed data distribution, these methods are plagued by the same deﬁciencies of poor interpretability and damaged credibility faced by non-agnostic inferential procedures for population-valued quantities. In contrast to the limited progress on obtaining inference for more reﬁned quantities, there has been considerable progress towards obtaining inference-free point estimates of (i) the percent reduction in infection probability conditional on immune response markers and (ii) the average treatment effect conditional on covariates. This progress has come from several ﬁelds, including statistics, machine learning, and computer science. This proposal outlines a uniﬁed methodology for obtaining inference for high-resolution quantities, where the proposal draws inspiration from a framework developed for population-level quantities, namely targeted minimum loss-based estimation, but features highly original developments that enable inference for higher-resolution, function-valued quantities. This work has the potential to make a major impact on the identiﬁcation of individual-level variables that correlate with vaccine efﬁcacy, including in identifying individuals who will be harmed by the only licensed dengue vaccine and in identify vaccine-induced immune responses that correlate with prevention in two ongoing HIV vaccine efﬁcacy trials. The potential for broad impacts to other areas of biomedical research, including precision medicine, are also described. Project Narrative The statistics and machine learning communities have made remarkable progress in developing highly ﬂexible data mining procedures that, for example, enable (i) the identiﬁcation of potentially protective vaccine-induced immune responses and (ii) the prediction of the optimal treatment for a given individual. Despite this progress, there has been little progress in quantifying the uncertainty in the output of these ﬂexible procedures without making implausible assumptions on the mechanism that generated the data, where the likely failure of these assumptions renders it difﬁcult to make (i) informed vaccine development decisions based on the identiﬁed immune response or (ii) treatment decisions based on the predicted optimal treatment. The proposed work develops a uniﬁed methodology for quantifying the uncertainty in estimates obtained using these data mining techniques, thereby enabling informed decision making.",High-Resolution Inference for Correlates of Vaccine Protection,9774603,DP2LM013340,"['Area', 'Biomedical Research', 'Breathing', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Dengue Vaccine', 'Development', 'Failure', 'HIV vaccine', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Observational Study', 'Output', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Uncertainty', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'efficacy trial', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'immune function', 'improved', 'learning community', 'optimal treatments', 'precision medicine', 'response biomarker', 'statistics', 'treatment effect', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine efficacy']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP2,2019,2332500,-0.004191598549032664
"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment.

"Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) white matter is an emerging new treatment strategy for treatment resistant depression (TRD) with published studies demonstrating sustained long-term antidepressant effects in 40-60% of implanted patients. Converging evidence from positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion tractography (DTI) strongly suggests that DBS mediates its clinical benefits by direct modulation of the SCC--a key hub in an aberrant neural circuit. Despite encouraging sustained long-term effects in this notoriously difficult to treat patient population, randomized controls trials of SCC DBS and other DBS targets for TRD are now on hold as initial results failed to meet predefined clinical endpoints. While this proposal cannot address those failures directly, a clear necessary next step for effective future testing and eventual dissemination of this treatment is the need to develop brain-based biomarkers to guide lead placement and to titrate stimulation parameters during ongoing care. In the absence of such biomarkers to guide DBS use, there will continue to be variability in the implementation of clinical procedures during testing, leading to ambiguous and possibly misleading trial outcomes, and subsequent abandonment of a potentially useful treatment. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop and test objective methods for reliable device configuration in individuals by optimizing DBS-SCC treatment with respect to human functional anatomy and key electrophysiological variables. We will leverage the capabilities of a novel bi-directional neuromodulation system (Medtronic RC+S) that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation to define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery. Ongoing measurements of SCC local field potentials (LFPs) will be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potential studies (ERP) performed as part of an experimental clinical trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS for TRD to identify an oscillatory signal that (1) is sensitive to changes in frequency and current parameters at the tractography defined optimal target and (2) tracks with depression state over time. Connectome-based and machine learning approaches will be used to define the most robust network biomarker and its response characteristics. Once defined, the control policy will be tested in a second phase feasibility study where parameters for initial stimulation will be selected based on the depression brain state biomarker and adjustments made to correct drift from the predefined target signal. If successful, the data- driven model and control strategy will enable objective, rational clinical programming of DBS stimulation for depression and provide a new model and approach for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment. ! ! . NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to refine and optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter for patients with treatment resistant depression. Using a newly available bi- directional neuromodulation system that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation, this study will define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery providing a new evidence-based strategy for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment. !",Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression,9929246,UH3NS103550,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Diffusion', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Failure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stream', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'antidepressant effect', 'base', 'clinical implementation', 'connectome', 'control trial', 'evidence base', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'response', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'white matter']",NINDS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,UH3,2019,165527,0.03417873687856515
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,9625118,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomarker performance', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2019,162123,0.0002953031899878654
"Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages PROJECT ABSTRACT Health insurance has been at the forefront of US public policy debate throughout the last decade. For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965. Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be a controversial definition. Some decisions about what Medicare should cover have engendered intense debate, underscoring the importance of the program’s coverage decisions for millions of patients and doctors. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. Yet, despite the importance of decisions about the scope of insurance coverage in and outside of Medicare, we know little about how the scope of coverage (as opposed to patient cost-sharing), affects treatment choices, clinical practice, and health outcomes for the elderly. The research outlined in this proposal aims to start filling this gap. The project investigates how the presence or lack of insurance coverage for specific procedural or pharmacologic therapies affects treatment decisions and health outcomes for the elderly with Alzheimer’s Disease and related Dementias (ADRD). This is a population that may be particularly vulnerable to changes and limits in insurance coverage, as the patients may have limited decision-making capacity and may be disproportionately exposed to treatments that are deemed experimental and lacking effectiveness to clear the “reasonable and necessary” threshold. Aim 1 of the project is to estimate the average effect of coverage decisions across prescription drugs and outpatient procedures on treatment decisions and health outcomes of elderly Medicare enrollees with ADRD. Aim 2 is to predict and characterize the subgroups of ADRD patients that are most likely to be affected by decisions that restrict the scope of insurance coverage using machine learning methods. The proposed empirical method is to use quasi- experimental variation that arises from natural experiments of abrupt changes in insurance coverage within different parts of the Medicare program. The analysis takes advantage of variation in the scope of formularies across Medicare Part D plans, as well as the variation in local coverage decisions for physician services and outpatient procedures under Medicare Part B. These sources of variation coupled with methods for quasi- experimental estimation of treatment effects and machine learning methods for heterogeneity analyses, allow estimating the response of treatment decisions and health of the elderly with ADRD across different drugs, procedures, and subgroups of ADRD patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965 - Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but nevertheless incomplete as by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be hard to define. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. In this project I investigate how changes in coverage for prescription drugs, physician office visits, and outpatient procedures affect the treatment received by elderly patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD), who often face coverage limitations due to experimental nature of many ADRD treatments, and yet may be most vulnerable to unintended consequences of any coverage restrictions.",Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages,9742306,K01AG059843,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Anxiety', 'Barbiturates', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Comorbidity', 'Cost Sharing', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family Physicians', 'Formularies', 'Fracture', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Geriatrics', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part B', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Natural experiment', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic procedure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universal Coverage', 'Variant', 'aging population', 'alternative treatment', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'decision-making capacity', 'design', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,126700,0.027036643188515404
"Integrative Learning to Combine Evidence for Personalized Treatment Strategies. Project Summary:  Mental disorders represent immense healthcare burdens. Intense efforts and resources have been devoted to developing pharmacological and behavioral treatments for mental disorders, but no universally effective treatments are available. Considerable heterogeneity exists in treatment response among individuals with mental disorders, in part because an individual patient's psychosocial characteristics and/or biomarkers are not accounted for when selecting among available treatment options. Barriers to implement personalized treatments in clinical psychiatry include a lack of evidence-based, clinically interpretable, individualized treatment rules (ITRs), a lack of power to detect treatment modifiers from a single study, and a lack of reproducibility for treatment rules estimated from single studies. We propose analytic solutions to tackle these barriers. Specifically, we will provide integrative machine learning methods to build powerful, yet interpretable, individualized treatment strategies that can be easily applied in clinical practice. We will integrate evidence of ITRs identified in multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to increase robustness and reproducibility. In Aim 1, we will provide piece-wise linear decision trees that are  transparent, interpretable, and that have guaranteed performance. Our decision trees will simultaneously identify the optimal treatment for a given patient (qualitative interaction) and subgroups of patients with large benefit  (quantitative interaction). In Aim 2, we propose a novel integrative analysis to synthesize evidence across trials and provide an integrative ITR that improves efficiency and reproducibility. Our method does not require all studies to collect common sets of variables and thus allows evidence to be combined from ITRs identified in recent RCTs that collected emerging biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging measures) with earlier RCTs that focused on clinical and  behavioral markers. In response to the National Institute of Mental Health Strategic Plan on Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to center mental health research around “dimensional psychological constructs” shared across disorders, the methods will be applied to a wide range of RCTs that recruited patients with major depressive disorder and other co-morbid mental disorders. This strategy allows examination of ITRs for constructs shared across disorders and will increase generalizability. We will apply our methods to various RCTs, including data available from the  National Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Illness. This research will bridge approaches for personalized medicine and integrative analysis in an effort to better understand the complex interplay between biomarkers and clinical manifestations in the context of selecting the best treatments for patients with mental disorders. Project Narrative:  Treatment responses for mental disorders are inadequate and considerable heterogeneity is observed, in part because an individual patient's clinical, psychosocial, and/or biological markers are not accounted for when select- ing treatments among available options.

"Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 16,870 deaths per year in the United States with 79,030 new bladder cancer cases diagnosed in 2017. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. We have successfully developed a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. A quantitative image analysis tool for bladder cancer (QIBC) that quantifies the bladder gross tumor volume (GTV) and image characteristics is an important component of CDSS-T. Advanced machine learning techniques are used to merge the GTV and radiomic biomarkers into an effective predictive model. The goal of this project is to validate the effectiveness of CDSS-T as an aid to the radiologists and the oncologists in assessment of bladder cancer change as a result of treatment through pilot clinical trials. We will (1) perform a preparatory clinical trial with the clinicians at UM, which will simulate the real prospective clinical trial with high quality retrospective data, (2) deploy the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the three collaborating clinical sites, (3) use the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the different clinical sites in the prospective pilot clinical trial (standard clinical workflow) utilizing the decision support in parallel to the standard clinical patient care, and (4) analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the clinicians' performance in the pilot clinical trial and assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. We hypothesize that this innovative approach can improve clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation and assessment of treatment response. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to evaluate the performance of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on cases not previously used, new to the system, for both the prediction accuracy and the automatic standalone functionality, refine and optimize the design of the user interface based on clinicians' feedback after their hands-on experience with the system to ensure its practicality and robustness, familiarize clinicians with the performance of the CDSS-T tools and the interpretation of the CDSS-T outputs as a part of user training for the prospective pilot clinical trial, (2) to optimize the QIBC and CDSS-T tools for the clinical workflow at the different clinical sites based on the site clinicians' feedback in order to operate efficiently and in a standalone mode by clinicians, (3) to record the clinicians' predicted outcomes without and with the use of the tools during the pilot clinical trials, estimate the accuracy of assessing response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the current clinical treatment paradigm by comparing the estimated response to the histopathologically determined response after radical cystectomy, and (4) to statistically analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the performance of the clinicians in the pilot clinical trial and statistically assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. PROJECT NARRATIVE We have previously developed a computer decision support system for (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. If successfully deployed and utilized, CDSS-T will be a useful tool to aid clinicians in improving the accuracy and reproducibility of tumor treatment response assessment. Improving the reliability in assessment of treatment response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying patients who do not respond to preserve their physical condition, thus allowing them to seek alternative treatment, which may reduce morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients suffering from bladder cancer. In addition, the multi-site pilot clinical trial will provide an excellent opportunity to experience the process of bringing laboratory research from bench to bedside, which will serve as a valuable guide for future development of clinically practical tools for various diseases.",Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer,9624294,U01CA232931,"['Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratory Research', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Cystectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,653319,-0.002540236720990401
"Predicting Patient Outcome in Multiple Sclerosis using a Quantitative Radiomic Approach Project Summary: Multiple sclerosis (MS), a leading cause of disability in young and middle-aged adults, is a highly heterogeneous disease, with wide variations in clinical presentation, disease course and response to treatment. In order to personalize care in MS, it is important to harness its clinical heterogeneity and the diversity of its underlying pathology, and to develop models able to predict individual behavior of patients. Brain magnetic resonance images (MRI), acquired routinely in MS patients, contain information that reflects underlying pathophysiology, which may be brought into light through quantitative analyses. Radiomics, a technique well developed in oncology, converts routine medical images into mineable high-dimensional data that can be modeled to support clinical decision-making. The central hypothesis of the proposed project is that radiomic analysis, combined with careful feature selection and accurate modeling, can predict patient outcome and response to therapy using standard-of-care MRI in MS. Our hypothesis will be tested by leveraging existing 3-year imaging and clinical data from the CombiRx trial, a multi-center, phase-III investigation of combination therapy in 1008 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients. We will first determine the potential for non-invasive radiomic biomarkers of disease severity in RRMS. Towards this goal, we will extract radiomic features of MS lesions from FLAIR, pre and postcontrast T1-weighted MR images using an open-source radiomic pipeline. Through appropriate feature selection, we will identify an independent radiomic feature set able to characterize individual phenotype on MRI in a selection cohort. We will then evaluate the selected features cross-sectionally to determine their efficacy in characterizing disease severity, leveraging training and validation subsets. The performance of our radiomic approach will be compared to traditional models using clinical and standard imaging markers such as lesion volume. In the second stage of this proposal, we will explore the performance of radiomic-based models to predict long-term outcome and treatment response in MS. We will build models to predict disease activity free status (DAFS) at 3 years using selected baseline radiomic features, and identify treatment response phenotypes. We will investigate and compare the performance of various machine-learning models in an unbiased manner. Finally, we will assess the effect of each therapeutic regimen on radiomic features by comparing on-treatment changes across treatment arms. This may provide evidence for treatment-specific monitoring parameters.   Project Narrative:    Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and disabling disorder of the central nervous system affecting over 1  million  individuals  in  the  United  States.  Unambiguous  and  robust  clinical  prediction  of  individual  outcome  and  treatment  response  is  deeply  needed  to  provide  personalized  medicine  to  MS  patients,  reduce disability, and minimize the burden of MS on individuals and society. Radiomics has the potential  to contribute to decision-­‐support systems in MS, by transforming routinely acquired magnetic resonance  images into mineable high-­‐dimensional data.   ",Predicting Patient Outcome in Multiple Sclerosis using a Quantitative Radiomic Approach,9824996,R03NS109715,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis', 'Risk', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'digital', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'middle age', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'novel', 'oncology', 'open source', 'patient response', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'response', 'routine practice', 'standard of care', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2019,88953,0.02332024502723503
"Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support PROJECT SUMMARY Treatments for mental health conditions such as unipolar depression provide modest average benefit but have wide variation between individuals and within individuals over time. Evidence-based customized treatment protocols would improve the mental health care of many people by providing treatment recommendations for individuals that take into account potential variation because of personal characteristics such as current health status, symptoms, and response to earlier treatment. Generating customized treatment protocols requires large amounts of data, such as from networks of health systems that can link electronic health records from millions of individuals. Current statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols are limited in three important ways.  First, current approaches rely on scientists to select the patient characteristics to use to customize treatments instead of using data to find the patient characteristics that will lead to improved, customized care. Second, customized treatment protocols discovered with current statistical methods assume no unobserved differences between individuals who receive various treatment options. Third, investigators do not have ways to know if the available data contain enough information to discover and compare customized treatment protocols precisely enough to make clinical decisions. We will address these three limitations by developing new statistical tools for discovering customized treatment protocols using electronic health records data. Our research team has expertise and experience in statistics, epidemiology, and mental health care. We will integrate methods that have been successfully used in other settings to improve statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols and address these three important limitations.  We will extend machine learning tools for selecting important pieces of information to the time-varying data structure required for discovering customized treatment protocols. We will build approaches that use available knowledge about the size of unobserved differences between groups of people who received different treatments to assess how those differences change study results. By building on the math used to estimate the sample sizes needed for precision in randomized trials with complex designs, we will develop new formulas for determining how many people with a particular condition and who took a particular drug are needed in a health system to provide enough accurate information to discover customized treatment protocols.  Using data from the electronic health records of more than 15,000 patients, we will discover customized treatment protocols for depression. By improving statistical tools and addressing current limitations, our customized treatment protocols will have immediate impact for people living with unipolar depression. The statistical tools we develop will also be useful for discovering customized treatment protocols for people with a wide variety of mental health conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE People living with mental health conditions and their health care providers often lack evidence for making choices about numerous treatment options and they do not have evidence-based, customized treatment plans. This project will develop customized treatment plans for unipolar depression and methods to generate these plans using data from electronic health care records. This work will address current limitations in statistical methods for selecting patient characteristics for customizing treatment, assessing bias from differences between people who take different medications, and calculating how many people are needed to accurately compare customized treatment plans using data from electronic health records.",Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support,9731644,R01MH114873,"['13 year old', 'Address', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sequential Treatment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical implementation', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'novel', 'practice setting', 'precision medicine', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,374957,0.06020190366639218
"Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality, clinical impairment, and comorbid psychopathology. Although evidence-based treatments for EDs have been established, the treatment gap is wide. Indeed, <20% of individuals with EDs receive treatment. We need a novel solution not only to identify individuals with EDs but also to encourage mental health services use and address treatment barriers. I have established a strong working relationship with the National EDs Association (NEDA), the U.S.'s leading non-profit for EDs, to offer our group's online, evidence-based EDs screen on the NEDA website. Over one year, the NEDA screen was completed >200,000 times. Among screen respondents, the vast majority screen positive for an ED, but of those, most are not in treatment, and only a small percentage click to learn more about one of the options for seeking intervention presented in the screening feedback. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” that is optimized to increase mental health services use among individuals with EDs through such features as: 1) providing a personalized recommendation for seeking intervention; 2) engaging the user in motivational interviewing to overcome barriers to care; and 3) repeated check-ins with the user to encourage follow-up with care. This research agenda aligns with NIMH's focus on services research and interest in technology-driven approaches to promote engagement with care. I will conduct two studies. First, I will utilize a user-centered design approach to create a prototype chatbot and conduct usability testing with adults with EDs to inform chatbot refinements (Aim 1). Second, I will conduct a randomized optimization trial with adults who have completed screening on the NEDA website and screen positive for an ED but are not in treatment to determine chatbot feasibility and to generate data on the effect of the chatbot on motivation for treatment post-initial chatbot use and motivation for treatment and mental health services use at 1- and 3-month follow-ups (Aims 2 & 3). This trial will employ the Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework, using a 23 full factorial design, to randomly assign participants to a combination of the three proposed intervention components (n=8 conditions) to isolate the active ingredients. These aims support my training plan in which I will receive expert mentorship and training in: services research and implementation science (Training Goal 1); user-centered design and usability testing, as well as exposure to machine learning (Training Goal 2); novel trial designs (Training Goal 3); and advanced statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal trial and digital innovation data (Training Goal 4). My expert mentorship team, along with the environment of Washington University, will ensure my success. Results from the proposed study will be used to optimize the chatbot, which I will then test in a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will equip me with the skills to become a leader in addressing the research-practice and treatment gaps for EDs, with a focus on digital innovations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses, but less than 20% of individuals receive treatment. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” for increasing mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders, with study data being used to optimize the chatbot for a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will not only result in the development of a highly scalable solution for facilitating mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders that has potential for widespread dissemination through partnership with the National Eating Disorders Association, but it will also result in an independent research program that addresses critical gaps in the treatment of eating disorders, with a focus on digital innovation solutions.","Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders",9806002,K08MH120341,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exposure to', 'Facebook', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Participant', 'Partnership Practice', 'Psychopathology', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Services', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'chatbot', 'computer program', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health service use', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'service delivery', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'success', 'trial design', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'web site']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2019,179096,-0.005633563288909888
"Optimal dynamic treatment strategies for controlling alcohol use: novel methods for selecting and incorporating effect modifiers Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone (ExTENd) trial, a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for those who are non-responsive to initial Naltrexone. One of the main challenges in this trial is the presence of the many variables available for consideration when making treatment decisions at each stage of the trial. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the ExTENd trial data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of a dynamic treatment regime (DTR) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal DTR is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Q-learning can be used with data from both SMARTs and observational studies to estimate an optimal DTR. However, like other model-based approaches, model misspecification can seriously affect the results and lead to the identification of suboptimal DTRs. The potential for misspecification increases with the number of variables that may influence treatment decisions through, e.g., incorrect assumptions on the relationship of variables to the outcome and the inclusion (exclusion) of unimportant (important) variables. These features represent the main analytical challenges for the ExTENd trial. We propose a new approach to Q-learning that leverages machine learning approaches to reduce the chances of misspecifying the relationship between the expected outcome and a given set of variables. We also develop a variable selection technique specifically designed for Q-learning that enables investigators to select the important variables from a long list of possibilities (e.g., genetic and demographic information, medical history over time) when estimating an optimal DTR. In both settings, we will develop new methods for conducting valid inferences (e.g., confidence intervals and p-values), including when there exist patients for whom treatment is neither beneficial nor harmful at a given decision stage (i.e., when an important technical assumption, “uniqueness”, is violated). Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available software in the R language that implements our methods. This will allow re-analysis of the ExTENd trial data with a goal of constructing a DTR that improves upon the current rescue treatment strategy for those non-responsive to initial Naltrexone. It will also provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal DTRs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for estimating the optimal treatment regime in substance use disorder. We will develop a variable selection technique that enables investigators to select important variables for the decision- making process among a long list of variables (e.g., patient’s genetic information, demographic characteristics, and medical history over time). We will also leverage statistical machine learning approaches to improve the quality of the constructed optimal treatment regimes while providing valid statistical inference.",Optimal dynamic treatment strategies for controlling alcohol use: novel methods for selecting and incorporating effect modifiers,9721702,R21AA027571,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcoholism', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dose', 'Exclusion', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical History', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'falls', 'genetic information', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'overtreatment', 'personalized medicine', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'response', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'virtual']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R21,2019,237402,0.051233316278291516
"Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) white matter is an emerging new treatment strategy for treatment resistant depression (TRD) with published studies demonstrating sustained long-term antidepressant effects in 40-60% of implanted patients. Converging evidence from positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion tractography (DTI) strongly suggests that DBS mediates its clinical benefits by direct modulation of the SCC--a key hub in an aberrant neural circuit. Despite encouraging sustained long-term effects in this notoriously difficult to treat patient population, randomized controls trials of SCC DBS and other DBS targets for TRD are now on hold as initial results failed to meet predefined clinical endpoints. While this proposal cannot address those failures directly, a clear necessary next step for effective future testing and eventual dissemination of this treatment is the need to develop brain-based biomarkers to guide lead placement and to titrate stimulation parameters during ongoing care. In the absence of such biomarkers to guide DBS use, there will continue to be variability in the implementation of clinical procedures during testing, leading to ambiguous and possibly misleading trial outcomes, and subsequent abandonment of a potentially useful treatment. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop and test objective methods for reliable device configuration in individuals by optimizing DBS-SCC treatment with respect to human functional anatomy and key electrophysiological variables. We will leverage the capabilities of a novel bi-directional neuromodulation system (Medtronic RC+S) that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation to define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery. Ongoing measurements of SCC local field potentials (LFPs) will be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potential studies (ERP) performed as part of an experimental clinical trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS for TRD to identify an oscillatory signal that (1) is sensitive to changes in frequency and current parameters at the tractography defined optimal target and (2) tracks with depression state over time. Connectome-based and machine learning approaches will be used to define the most robust network biomarker and its response characteristics. Once defined, the control policy will be tested in a second phase feasibility study where parameters for initial stimulation will be selected based on the depression brain state biomarker and adjustments made to correct drift from the predefined target signal. If successful, the data- driven model and control strategy will enable objective, rational clinical programming of DBS stimulation for depression and provide a new model and approach for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment. . NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to refine and optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter for patients with treatment resistant depression. Using a newly available bi- directional neuromodulation system that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation, this study will define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery providing a new evidence-based strategy for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment.",Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression,9743002,UH3NS103550,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffusion', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Failure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Resistance', 'Scalp structure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'antidepressant effect', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'connectome', 'control trial', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'implantation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open label', 'patient population', 'response', 'support tools', 'targeted biomarker', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'white matter']",NINDS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,UH3,2019,1262523,0.03417873687856515
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,9776969,R44AI145505,"['Adopted', 'Advocate', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Expression Profiling', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologist', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain health', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'drug efficacy', 'effective therapy', 'experimental group', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'preservation', 'response', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2019,149824,0.038867605699213624
"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary/Abstract  Current medical treatment guidelines largely rely on data from randomized controlled trials that study  average effects, which may be inadequate for making individualized decisions for real-world patients. Large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) data provide unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized treatment strategies and generate evidence relevant to real-world patients. However, there are inherent challenges in the use of EHRs, including non-experimental nature of data collection processes, heterogeneous data types with complex dependencies, irregular measurement patterns, multiple dynamic treatment sequences, and the need to balance risk and benefit of treatments. Using two high-quality EHR databases, Columbia University Medical Center's clinical data warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care database, and focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D), this proposal will develop novel and scalable statistical learning approaches that overcome these challenges to discover optimal personalized treatment strategies for T2D from real-world patients. Specifically, under Aim 1, we will develop a unified framework to learn latent temporal processes for feature extraction and dynamic patient records representation. Our approach will accommodate large-scale variables of mixed types (continuous, binary, counts) measured at irregular intervals. They extract lower-dimensional components to reflect patients' dynamic health status, account for informative healthcare documentation processes, and characterize similarities between patients. Under Aim 2, we will develop fast and efficient multi-category machine learning methods, in order to evaluate treatment propensities and adaptively learn optimal dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) among the extensive number of treatment options observed in the EHRs. The methods will provide  sequential decisions that determine the best treatment sequence for a T2D patient given his/her EHRs. Under Aim 3, we will develop statistical learning methods to assist multi-faceted treatment decision-making, which balances risks versus benefits when evaluating a DTR. Our approach will ensure maximizing benefit to the greatest extent while controlling all risk outcomes under the safety margins. For all aims, we will develop efficient stochastic resampling algorithms to scale up the optimization for massive data sizes. We will identify optimal DTRs for T2D using the extracted information from patients' comorbidity conditions, medications, and laboratory tests, as well as records-collection processes. Our methodologies will be applied and cross-validated between the two EHR databases. The treatment strategies learned from the representative EHR databases with a diverse patient  population will be beneficial for individual patient care, assisting clinicians to adaptively choose the optimal treatment for a patient. Finally, we will disseminate our methods and results through freely available software and outreach to the informatics and clinical experts at our Centers for Translational Science and elsewhere. Project Narrative  This proposal aims to develop novel and scalable statistical learning methods to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) and use two real-world, high-quality EHR databases for personalized medicine research. The methods will handle the non-experimental nature of data collection processes, along with heterogeneous data types, dynamic treatment sequences, and the trade-off between benefit and risk outcomes.

"RADIOMICS-BASED PROGNOSTIC MODEL OF CERVICAL CANCER HABITATS Abstract Despite significant advances in disease prevention and screening, locally-advanced cervical cancer (LACC) continues to be an important world-wide public health problem. Responses to currently available treatments are highly variable among patients with similar constellations of accepted prognostic features, implying that chemo-radio sensitivity, patterns of local tumor proliferation, and the propensity of metastatic spread are highly dependent on each patient's potentially unique cervix cancer habitat. Radiomic analysis of pre-, in-, and post- treatment medical images is an exciting new class of prognostic cancer biomarkers for characterizing tumor habit and has shown promise in more accurately separating favorable- from unfavorable- prognosis for patients for several tumor sites. No such radiomic-based prognostic model has been developed, for LACC that supports meaningful personalization of local and systemic treatment or biologically treatment adaptation based on response of radiomic biomarker profiles to the initial fractions of radiotherapy. To support future personalized chemo-radiation therapy, we propose to exploit a large, prospectively collected database of ~400 LACC patients consisting of archived PET, MRI, and CT images, standard biomarkers, and clinical outcomes to develop an innovative and accurate radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting LACC treatment outcomes. Previous efforts to utilize high-dimensional radiomic feature spaces to predict cancer treatment outcomes have been compromised by small patient numbers relative to the feature space dimensionality; radiomic feature redundancy, feature heterogeneity and uncertainty; unbalanced outcome class patient cohorts; and intrinsic differences in prognostic information content for features extracted from different modality images. We propose a principled and systematic strategy to address these challenges: a novel combination of belief function theory (BFT) and more standard machine learning techniques. To achieve these goals, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: Develop a novel radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting outcomes of cervical cancer patients treated with definitive chemo-radiotherapy given longitudinal radiomic features from pre-, in-, and post treatment PET, CT, and MR images. Aim 2: Refine the developed prognostic model by use of the full 400 patient cases and systematically validate and test its performance. Aim 3: Investigate the potential clinical impact of the radiomic-based prognostic model and selected clinical applications. Clinical Impact and future plans: This project will result in a clinically useful family of models for predicting disease control outcomes from current LACC treatments. This clinical decision-making tool can be used to personalize initial treatment prescriptions as well as adaptive treatment prescription when combined with in-treatment radiomic biomarkers. We anticipate that many of the proposed methodological improvements investigated by this proposal will improve tumor response assessment in other disease sites.

"The neural bases of placebo effects and their relation to regulatory processes Placebo treatments can induce clinically significant benefits, compared with no-treatment controls, across a variety of disorders. But placebo treatments themselves are pharmacologically and physically inert: Their benefits result from active brain and psychological responses to the treatment context. Neuroscientific studies have established that placebo treatments influence cortical-subcortical brain pathways and neurochemical systems relevant for expectation, appraisals of personal and social meaning, and value-driven learning. These systems are also related to symptom progression across mental health disorders and several other neurological and substance use disorders. Understanding the brain and psychological mechanisms of placebo effects will help improve psychological and neurological (e.g., neuromodulation-based) treatments across disorders. This R01 renewal funds an ongoing program of research that has made fundamental contributions to this literature. It has also identified several significant gaps that are particularly important for connecting placebo research to mental health. One gap is that our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects comes almost purely from studies of pain. The proposed studies extend previous work to study the brain pathways underlying placebo effects in anxiety and social rejection, negative affective processes directly relevant for multiple mental health disorders. Pattern-recognition (machine learning) analyses identify the most symptom-relevant pathways, and test effects of placebo and other context interventions on these pathways. In Aim 1 (Experiments 1-3), we develop models across multiple affective symptoms, parsing affective pathways into those that are symptom-specific and those that generalize across multiple symptoms and outcomes. We also address the role of endogenous opioids, strongly linked to placebo analgesia, in other negative affective experiences. Another gap is that most previous studies of the context variables that drive strong placebo effects—including social influences, treatment history—have not been studied extensively at the brain level. In Aim 2, we study the brain pathways underlying several promising context interventions that enhance the strength of placebo effects, including social modeling of successful or unsuccessful treatment response, initial experiences of treatment success or failure, and the match between placebo suggestions and a person’s predisposition to be receptive to them. Project narrative Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo treatments induce active neurobiological processes related to patients’ expectations, learned associations, perceived care and support, and hope for the future. Studying placebo treatments provides a window into these crucial context variables that will help understand vulnerability and resilience to mental health disorders and beyond.

"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes. This project aims to improve exposure therapy response for patients with social anxiety disorder by directly linking exposure therapy response to the neurobiology of extinction learning.",Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory,9675335,K23MH113708,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Dorsal', 'Exposure to', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Severities', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient response', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'statistics', 'theories', 'treatment of anxiety disorders']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2019,186408,0.009317597803977885
"Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: Dr. Strom received an MD from Harvard Medical School (HMS), and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (BIDMC), and non-invasive cardiac imaging (BIDMC). Additionally, he completed an MSc in Epidemiology program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in May, 2018. He is now a junior faculty member at BIDMC with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. Through this proposed 5-year program, Dr. Strom will pursue additional training in advanced prediction modeling, machine learning, patient-oriented research, and metabolomics. The candidate’s long- term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the area of applied outcomes research. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Robert W. Yeh (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Director of the Smith Center for Outcomes Research in Cardiology, Robert E. Gerszten (Co-Mentor), Professor of Medicine at HMS and Chief of Cardiovascular Medicine at BIDMC, and Changyu Shen (Co-Mentor), upcoming Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Lead Biostatistician for the Smith Center. Dr. Yeh has a track record of leading practice-changing studies and successful mentorship of clinician investigators. Dr. Gerszten is an internationally recognized expert in molecular phenotyping of cardiovascular diseases using metabolomics and proteomics and has mentored several K-award and R01 funded clinical investigators. Dr. Shen has a long track record of NIH funding, expertise in evaluating heterogeneity of treatment effect in cardiovascular diseases, and has mentored multiple prior trainees. Research: The optimal therapy for a given individual with aortic stenosis remains uncertain. This proposal seeks to define the clinical and biologic components of frailty that modify risk after aortic valve replacement (AVR) and alter treatment benefit. For Aims 1-2, we will leverage the unique linkage of Medicare data to the US CoreValve Pivotal trials, a collection of clinical trials that randomized individuals with severe aortic stenosis to transcatheter AVR (TAVR) with a self-expanding bioprosthesis vs. surgical AVR (SAVR). In Aim 1, we will we will identify which variables, related to in-person assessments of frailty and candidate frailty codes, best predict adverse outcomes after AVR. In Aim 2, we will identify if novel variables identified in Aim 1, identify a heterogeneous treatment response in individuals undergoing AVR. In Aim 3, we will prospectively enroll patients undergoing TAVR at BIDMC with concurrent frailty phenotyping to identify whether metabolites associated with longevity correlate with frailty and predict adverse outcomes, independent of age and comorbidities. The research will identify the mechanisms by which frailty confers adverse risk and differential treatment benefit in AVR, providing insights that may personalize treatment selection and improve patient care. PROJECT NARRATIVE While new technologies have permitted the use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis, which is fatal without treatment, deciding on the optimal treatment for a given patient is often difficult, especially as these decisions are often made towards the end of life and there are significant risks concomitant with each treatment. In this setting, frailty, a state of debility that impairs recovery from illness, has emerged as a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes but the mechanisms by which frailty confers risk and the components of frailty that are most important are unknown. In this proposal, we seek to define the clinical and biological components of frailty that contribute risk in aortic valve replacement using a combination of novel data sources and methodologic techniques, including linkage of clinical trials to administrative data, machine learning, and metabolite profiling, in order to personalize treatments and optimize patient health and medical decision making.",Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling,9821515,K23HL144907,"['Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bioprosthesis device', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronology', 'Citric Acid Cycle', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Israel', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physician Executives', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'adverse event risk', 'adverse outcome', 'aortic valve replacement', 'base', 'end of life', 'frailty', 'health data', 'health service use', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'mid-career faculty', 'minimally invasive', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'optimal treatments', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'surgical risk', 'treatment effect', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2019,172800,0.026431341707801016
"2/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric diorders Abstract  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly heritable, debilitating diseases with lifetime prevalences of ~1% and 15%, respectively. Both disorders carry substantial morbidity and mortality and are associated with severe societal and personal costs. Despite the availability of efficacious treatments for both disorders, ~1/3 of individuals will not achieve symptomatic improvement even after multiple rounds of medication. Identifying individuals at greater risk for such treatment nonresponse, or treatment resistance, could facilitate more targeted interventions for these individuals.  A burgeoning literature has identified genomic variation associated with treatment response. In particular, antidepressant response has been suggested to be highly heritable; convergent data from rodent studies likewise suggest that antipsychotic and antidepressant response phenotypes are influenced by genetic variation. However, treatment studies to date have had minimal success in identifying variants associated with psychotropic response, likely as a result of limited sample sizes: prior efforts required sequential treatment trials and prospective assessment to characterize outcomes. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) data provide an opportunity to efficiently characterize treatment response in many individuals in real-world settings. Coupled with large and expanding biobanks, these cohorts allow for low- cost, large-scale genomic studies that finally achieve sufficient power to detect realistic effect sizes.  The investigators now propose to apply these approaches to the EHRs of two large regional health systems, each linked to a large biobank, to investigate treatment resistance in SCZ and MDD. They will apply canonical indicators of treatment resistance - clozapine treatment for SCZ, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for MDD - to identify coded and uncoded clinical features associated with high probability of treatment resistance in EHR data. These predictors will themselves provide a useful baseline for identifying high risk individuals. Then, they will apply these to study the entire affected population of each biobank, extending existing genomic data with additional genome-wide association, yielding more than 25,000 antidepressant-treated individuals and 2,200 antipsychotic-treated individuals. Rather than simply conducting a case-control study, they will examine treatment resistance as a quantitative trait, applying a method developed by the investigators and shown to substantially increase power for such traits.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and analysis of large scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in psychiatric treatment resistance. Spanning two distinct health systems, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next- step investigations. Successful identification of risk variants will facilitate efforts at clinical risk stratification as well as investigation of the biology underlying treatment resistance. Public Health Statement Despite the availability of effective treatments for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, around 1/3 of individuals will not have symptomatic improvement after multiple treatment trials. If individuals at high risk for treatment resistance could be identified early, it might be possible to find more effective treatments for them. In particular, this study seeks to use electronic health records and biobanks to identify genomic variation associated with treatment resistance.",2/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric diorders,9661173,R01MH116269,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Biology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clozapine', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sequential Treatment', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Suicide attempt', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Step', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'genomic predictors', 'genomic variation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'personalized intervention', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'risk variant', 'success', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy resistant', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment trial']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,425000,0.057683217710993696

The investigators now propose to apply these approaches to the EHRs of two large regional health systems, each linked to a large biobank, to investigate treatment resistance in SCZ and MDD. They will apply canonical indicators of treatment resistance - clozapine treatment for SCZ, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for MDD - to identify coded and uncoded clinical features associated with high probability of treatment resistance in EHR data. These predictors will themselves provide a useful baseline for identifying high risk individuals. Then, they will apply these to study the entire affected population of each biobank, extending existing genomic data with additional genome-wide association, yielding more than 26,000 antidepressant-treated individuals and 2,500 antipsychotic-treated individuals. Rather than simply conducting a case-control study, they will examine treatment resistance as a quantitative trait, applying a method developed by the investigators and shown to substantially increase power for such traits.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and analysis of large scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in psychiatric treatment resistance. Spanning two distinct health systems, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next- step investigations. Successful identification of risk variants will facilitate efforts at clinical risk stratification as well as investigation of the biology underlying treatment resistance. Public Health Statement Despite the availability of effective treatments for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, around 1/3 of individuals will not have symptomatic improvement after multiple treatment trials. If individuals at high risk for treatment resistance could be identified early, it might be possible to find more effective treatments for them. In particular, this study seeks to use electronic health records and biobanks to identify genomic variation associated with treatment resistance.",1/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric disorders,9660127,R01MH116270,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Biology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clozapine', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sequential Treatment', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Suicide attempt', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Step', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'genomic predictors', 'genomic variation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'personalized intervention', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'risk variant', 'success', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy resistant', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment trial']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,421250,0.05757192903951839
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for Chagas disease Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these challenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymorphisms, whole brain neuroimaging, biofluids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mechanisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Specifically, in Aim 1, we develop efficient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation models to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efficiency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-specific substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic systems through ordinary differential equations with random inflections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker profiles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efficient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individualized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest benefit from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art analytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research community. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9694287,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,340259,0.00989529738746752
"Evaluation of molecular mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression DESCRIPTION: Over the past decades, antidepressants and psychotherapy have been the first-line treatments for LLD. Despite being safe and well-tolerated, a large number of patients do not achieve full and persistent remission after initial treatment. About 50% of patients with LLD do not respond after two antidepressant trials, meeting the consensus definition of treatment resistance (TR-LLD). The persistence of chronic and elevated depressive symptoms in older adults has significant clinical and public health implications. This has been correlated to poor general health, reduced quality of life, and a higher risk of mortality when compared to those with sustained remission after treatment. Despite the relevance to public health of TR-LLD, there is little information about the biological mechanisms and no robust clinical prediction model to evaluate at the outset of antidepressant therapy who will or will not respond to treatment. Leveraging an NIMH funded clinical trial, the Incomplete Response in Late-Life Depression: Getting to Remission” (IRL-GREY), across 3 sites, in this study, we propose to evaluate the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression and to develop a machine learning based algorithm for prediction of treatment response in these subjects. We will carry out a comprehensive, multiplexed proteomic analysis on 542 samples from patients who completed phase 1 and phase 2 of the clinical trial. We hypothesise that ageing-related biological pathways (i.e. inflammatory response control, proteostasis control, cell damage response, endothelial function) will be associated with poorer treatment response in LLD. Moreover, we hypothesize that a machine learning derived biomarker panel will have sensitivity and specificity greater than 80% to predict treatment response in LLD. Finally, we will evaluate the biological mechanisms related to different depressive symptoms trajectories after treatment. This work will set the stage for a biologically-driven model of treatment response that will be useful to guide, at the outset of antidepressant treatment, those who will benefit more from a specific treatment. If successful, our work can accelerate therapeutic efforts and innovation targeting depression and reduce suffering for large numbers of elderly and their families. Using advanced molecular approaches, we will determine the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression. Our proposed study will also develop a predictive tool combining neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and protein data to identify who with late-life depression is more likely to have no benefit from antidepressant treatment at the outset of therapy. The goal of the study is to clarify the mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression, and whether we can effectively identify those who will benefit from antidepressant therapy at the outset of treatment.",Evaluation of molecular mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression,9816774,R01MH118311,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Disease remission', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Elderly', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geroscience', 'Growth Factor', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteomics', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'aripiprazole', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'geriatric depression', 'high risk', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'open label', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'proteostasis', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'venlafaxine']",NIMH,CENTRE FOR ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH,R01,2019,518325,0.07972703153773636
"Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response PROJECT SUMMARY The growing expansion of the approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and the variable responses to MS treatment have created an unmet medical need to provide individually tailored therapy. Efforts to bring precision medicine to provide individualized MS treatment selection have been impeded by our limited understanding of the factors that determine treatment response. While genomics hold the promise for closing this knowledge gap, the insufficient number of patients with detailed treatment response data and the modest effect size of genetic variants that influence treatment responses are the main limiting factors in pharmacogenomics studies. As electronic health records (EHR) become widely adopted and increasingly standardized and as we implement sophisticated computational and statistical methods to harness the EHR data, EHR systems can become cost-effective platforms to perform large-scale treatment response studies in real-life settings. Our team with a history of productive collaborations and diverse expertise (led by PI Dr. Xia) previously developed robust algorithms to identify 5,495 MS patients from the Partners HealthCare EHR systems and then model MS disease activity in these patients using EHR data. The Partners EHR system contains longitudinal clinical information on thousands of MS patients from two large academic medical centers and is linked to a well-characterized MS patient research registry and biobanks with existing genomics data. For the proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that meaningful phenotypes of MS disease activity can be extracted from EHR data to inform treatment response, and that additional common genetic variants exist in the population and can predict therapeutic response in MS when combined with clinical features derived from EHR data. The proposed study has three aims with the overall goal to produce a computational and analytic approach capable of identifying MS disease activity in relation to treatment history using EHR data and integrate with genomics profile to develop a predictive model of therapeutic response to commonly prescribed DMTs in this cohort of 5,495 MS patients, including injectable (interferon-β, glatiramer acetate) and oral (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) options. Specifically, we will (1) leverage narrative electronic health records data (e.g., clinical notes, radiology reports) and natural language processing (NLP) to ascertain individualized response to DMTs (n=600 for each DMT); (2) Identify clinical features from electronic health record data (e.g., diagnoses, exposures) that predict response to DMTs using a systematic phenome-wide approach; (3) Develop and test a comprehensive predictive model of individualized response to DMTs that incorporates clinical and genetic predictors. This research has the potential impact to be transformative by contributing to a major knowledge gap regarding the factors that influence treatment response and bringing precision medicine closer to individualized MS treatment selection. PROJECT NARRATIVE AND PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition that affects over 400,000 individuals in the United States and creates a high socioeconomic burden as a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Because not all patients respond the same way to a specific medication, physicians and MS patients often lose precious time searching for effective treatment with serially testing of costly medications. An individually tailored treatment can ensure early start of effective medication that can prevent relapse and progression of disability. Ultimately, this project will help gain insights into the factors that determine treatment response and enable physicians to match an individual MS patient's clinical and genomic profile with uniquely tailored therapy to maximize effectiveness, delay disease progression and reduce overall cost.",Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response,9747390,R01NS098023,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Fumarates', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injectable', 'Interferon-beta', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'copolymer 1', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'individual response', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'patient response', 'phenome', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,298872,0.04333817380195944
"Advancing the Measurement and Classification of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S. adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making. Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated, and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380 participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes researchers. The proposed work has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS.

"Efficacy of biomarker-guided rTMS for treatment resistant depression Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global disability, and approximately 30% of MDD patients are resistant to conventional antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is an FDA-cleared intervention with proven efficacy in treatment-resistant depression, but only 30–40% of these patients achieve remission after a single course. Other studies have shown that rTMS targeting the dorsomedial PFC (DMPFC) is comparably effective, but biomarkers for informing target site selection and predicting differential treatment response are not currently available. Diagnostic heterogeneity has been a major obstacle to biomarker discovery efforts. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to diagnosing four novel MDD subtypes or “biotypes” defined by distinct resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns in Valence System circuits and predicting differing antidepressant responses at the individual level to rTMS targeting the DMPFC. This confirmatory efficacy trial will test a novel, biotype-guided treatment selection strategy motivated by the hypothesis that an individual patient's likelihood of responding to left DLFPC vs. DMPFC rTMS is determined in part by individual differences in 1) the degree to which their symptoms are driven by dysfunction in specific downstream amygdala, striatal, and salience network targets comprising aspects of Valence Systems; and 2) the degree to which dysfunction in those targets can be modulated by stimulating the left DLPFC or DMPFC. Subjects (N=405) will be randomized to receive a) biotype-guided 10 Hz rTMS targeting the DMPFC or left DLPFC; b) to a disconfirmation arm receiving rTMS targeting the opposite site; and c) to a third arm receiving FDA-cleared, standard-of-care 10 HZ rTMS targeting the left DLFPC, regardless of biotype. All patients will be tested before and after treatment on a battery of fMRI, behavioral, and clinical assessments, grounded in RDoC-informed measures of emotion regulation and effort valuation, which will enable us to validate downstream brain circuit treatment targets and test for target engagement, in conjunction with state-of-the-art, anatomically realistic electric field modeling and fiber tractography. The primary goal is to confirm the efficacy of a novel RSFC biomarker-guided approach to differential treatment selection in treatment resistant depression, with the potential for significantly enhanced efficacy compared to the current standard-of-care. Depression is the second leading cause of disability worldwide, due partly to the fact that existing antidepressants are not effective for all patients and it is often challenging to match individual patients to the treatments that are most likely to help them. This project will test a new strategy for using fMRI brain scans to predict antidepressant response and assist clinicians in choosing which of two antidepressant treatments— transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting one of two depression-related brain areas—is most likely to benefit an individual patient.",Efficacy of biomarker-guided rTMS for treatment resistant depression,9648914,R01MH118388,"['Accounting', 'Aftercare', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anhedonia', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease remission', 'Exhibits', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Work', 'anxious', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical predictors', 'comparative efficacy', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'efficacy trial', 'electric field', 'emotion regulation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tractography', 'treatment response', 'treatment-resistant depression']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,1245371,0.03196892928911262
"SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea  The ability to rapidly match the right patients to the right treatments at the right time is critical to ensuring patients  receive high quality care. The vast majority of machine learning applications in healthcare focus on diagnosing or  stratifying patients for a particular outcome. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn how clinical states  (i.e., sets of signs, symptoms, and test results) respond to specific sequences of treatments, with the goal of optimizing clinical outcomes. RL does not aim to diagnose, but infers diagnosis based on a patient's response to  specific treatments--in many ways mimicking how clinicians operate in practice. This proposal will develop a novel  clinician-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (RL) framework that analyzes electronic health record (EHR) clinical time-series data to support physician decision making, iteratively providing physicians the estimated outcome of  potential treatment strategies. Our topic of focus for this work is the evaluation and treatment of patients hospitalized with acute dyspnea (shortness of breath) and signs of impending respiratory failure. Acute dyspnea is an ideal condition for an RL approach, since it can be due to three overlapping conditions: congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Determining optimal treatment for these patients is clinically difficult, as a patient's presentation is frequently ambiguous, rapidly changing, and often due to multiple causes.  Inappropriate treatment may occur in up to a third of patients leading to increased mortality. While developing this  RL framework, we will also develop methods to learn more useful representations of high-dimensional clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training. In addition, given the challenges of working with observational health data, we will develop new methods for evaluation of learned policies and develop new theory to better understand the limitations of RL using observational data. The project has four aims: 1) create a shareable, de-identified EHR time-series dataset of 35,000 patients with acute dyspnea, 2) develop techniques for exploiting invariances In tasks involving clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training, 3) develop and evaluate an RL-based framework for learning optimal treatment policies for acute dyspnea, and 4) prospectively validate the learned treatment model. This research will result in new techniques for learning representations from time-series data and will study both the theoretical and practical limitations of RL using observational clinical data, leading to key advancements in ML and RL for clinical care. The tools developed for clinical decision support in this proposal have the potential for high impact because of their ability to generalize beyond the problem studied here to other conditions, laying the groundwork for clinical systems that directly impact society by aiding in the timely and appropriate treatment of patients. Hospitalization for sudden and severe shortness of breath (acute dyspnea) affects almost 2 million patients in the US each  year. Such patients can be difficult to treat, as their presentation may ambiguous, due to multiple causes that change over  time and require different types of therapies/treatments. In this proposal, we will develop novel reinforcement-learning  based approaches to quickly match patients to the best treatment based on his/her symptoms over time. The proposed  work could have a significant impact on health by shortening lhe time to appropriate treatments, leading to improved  patient outcomes.",SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea ,9927810,R01LM013325,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Pneumonia', 'Policies', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Right to Treatments', 'Series', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'programs', 'prospective', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,238522,0.02385879749951522
"Applying statistical learning tools to personalize cardiovascular treatment Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) treatment is often guided by risk stratification tools (to decide who to treat), and randomized controlled trials (to decide which treatments to select). Prior CVD research reveals two major  obstacles to improving our treatment approach: (i) longitudinal cohort data are unavailable for recalibrating risk stratification tools for local-area estimation (by zip code), or for people with major CVD-promoting  comorbidities (e.g., chronic kidney disease); and (ii) the average treatment effect in randomized trials can be highly erroneous when projected onto individuals that vary from the ‘average’ participant in a trial. CVD risk- stratification and treatment effect estimation can be improved and personalized if we overcome a critical barrier to progress: correctly estimating risk and treatment effect from new, large participant data repositories, which have greater population size and include patients with more co-morbid conditions than common cohort studies, and which permit personalized risk/benefit prediction tool development from individual-level data. Our prior studies show that we can critically advance the field by applying novel statistical learning methods to this data, to address: (i) false-positives from multiple testing; (ii) the reliance on standard regressions that cannot account for non-linear, complex interactions between factors; and (iii) identifying the optimal approach among many alternative statistical learning methods. We propose to apply our work in these areas to (Aim 1) Develop CVD risk stratification tools for patients with inadequate sample sizes in common cohort studies. We will enhance CVD risk stratification to include local-area adjustment (by zip code) and major co-morbid conditions affecting CVD risk (e.g., chronic kidney disease). We will additionally (Aim 2) develop personalized treatment effect  prediction tools to guide decisions for CVD therapies with high potential benefit and risk, for therapies where  individual participant data from trials are available. We have obtained the individual participant data from the large randomized trials that reveal wide variations in CVD risk reduction and serious adverse event risk increase from three drug classes: non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, intensive blood pressure treatment, and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors for diabetes. Our preliminary research shows that traditional  regression methods cannot distinguish which patients are most likely to benefit or be harmed by such therapies, but our statistical learning methods can. Finally, we will (Aim 3) develop open-source tools to improve the ability of researchers to choose an optimal statistical learning approach for their dataset and problem. While numerous statistical learning methods have been proposed in the literature, a key problem for biomedical scientists  without access to RCT data is: which method should I use to estimate treatment effects from observational data? Building on our innovative approach to identify the optimal inference method for observational data, we will construct an open-source tool to compare methods, identifying which method most often results in optimal treatment decisions that minimize error and maximize performance on standardized metrics. Public health relevance  Using current cardiovascular disease risk stratification tools, about 31.6 million Americans will receive an incorrect cardiovascular disease risk estimate that will lead to wrong treatment, per current guidelines.  Furthermore, extrapolating the average treatment effect for major preventive cardiovascular disease treatments— rather than calculating a personalized risk/benefit score—contributes to 4.9 million serious adverse events from treatment complications each year. In this project, we seek to address both problems: improving  cardiovascular disease risk stratification, and developing personalized calculators for risk and benefit of major  cardiovascular disease treatments.",Applying statistical learning tools to personalize cardiovascular treatment,9637461,R01HL144555,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anticoagulants', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Fasting', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population Sizes', 'Preventive', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Reduction', 'Risk stratification', 'Sample Size', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Sodium', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Thromboplastin', 'Variant', 'Wages', 'Work', 'adverse event risk', 'biomedical scientist', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular disorder therapy', 'clinical care', 'data warehouse', 'editorial', 'fasting glucose', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'stroke risk', 'symporter', 'tool', 'tool development', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,774381,0.00885552868931198
"Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients ABSTRACT  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder that likely involves multiple underlying pathological mechanisms, which has plagued attempts to identify rational therapeutic targets. All available antipsychotic drugs (APD) are dopamine receptor antagonists, but clinical response is variable, with a third of patients being partial responders, and a third non-responders. Arguably, those who respond well to APD have primarily dopaminergic abnormalities but it is imperative to also characterize the specific underlying pathologies in those with poor response in order to unravel the heterogeneity of psychosis and effectively develop new treatments. We propose to longitudinally follow treatment response to APD for eight months in medication-naïve first episode psychosis (FEP) subjects using complementary brain imaging techniques.  We already have identified provisional markers for several different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychosis, including abnormalities in glutamate, brain connectivity, and neurodevelopment that we can track with brain imaging. In addition, we propose to study the changes that occur in the brain in early compared to delayed treatment responders and changes that occur over time in response to treatment. By characterizing treatment trajectories and their relationship to baseline pathophysiologic alterations, we will further complement our mechanistic understanding of the heterogeneity of psychosis.  We propose to study 60 well-characterized FEP subjects who are medication naïve and treat them with the most frequently used APD for 32 weeks. We will follow a rigorous longitudinal design to capture treatment response whereby those without an adequate response after 16 weeks of treatment will be switched to another APD for 16 weeks. All patients will be scanned four times: at baseline and after 6, 16, and 32 weeks of treatment. We will use (1) proton MR Spectroscopy (MRS), (2) task and resting state functional MRI and (3) MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to measure brain biochemistry, function and structure. Using several imaging modalities has the potential to interrogate different neurobiological aspects of treatment response and will offer greater opportunities for clustering the patterns and combinations of the underlying pathologies in those with poor response.  Deconstructing the heterogeneity of psychosis has broad implications for the identification of specific targets for drug development, and to lay the groundwork needed to conduct therapeutic trials on patients characterized by their specific underlying psychopathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder and present treatment only works for a limited number of patients.

"Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program “Optimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasis”constitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC “Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis” will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities OVERVIEW NARRATIVE Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment.

"A Big Data Approach to BCR ABL Leukemias BCR-ABL1 positive leukemias account for a substantial portion of adult leukemia. Tyrosine kinase  inhibitors (TKIs) have dramatically changed survival outlook. However, current protocols recommend  patients receive TKI chemotherapy agents indefinitely, causing long-term toxicity and substantive  quality of life deficits, leading to decreased TKI compliance. Moreover, >50% of patients who stop  TKIs ultimately relapse and are not as responsive to post-relapse treatment; additionally, mutation  resistance is becoming an increasing issue with TKIs as patients live longer. It is hypothesized  patient heterogeneity within BCR-ABL1 leukemias are a major driving factor on outcome and strongly  influences optimal TKI selection and cessation. However, small cohort size and disease rarity has  impacted large, pragmatic clinical trials, necessitating a big data approach. The overall goal is  to quilt together individual studies to produce a comprehensive view of BCR-ABL1 leukemias that  includes epidemiology, etiology, assessment, and therapy, as well their inter-relationships. With  a comprehensive view, personalized, predictive medicine becomes possible. This project utilizes  literature mining and “big data” techniques to analyze four major categories: epidemiology (who  gets BCR-ABL1 leukemias, how response correlates to patient characteristics, etc.); etiology (what  factors trigger mutation, mechanisms to improve TKI specificity, preclinical model metrics,  prognostic indicators of recurrence/relapse, etc.); assessment (identifying new  diagnostic/prognostic metrics, improving polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols, objective  staging criteria); and treatment (aggregate effect sizes among different therapies, short and  long-term side effect profiles, TKI selection protocols, adjunctive and combination therapies,  criteria for TKI cessation, etc.). The specific aims of the project include: 1) prototype a data  path and construct infrastructure for BCR-ABL1 data curation from literature and/or clinical  sources; 2) construct literature ontological field map to quantify topic depth, aggregate data, and  identify relationships within and between categories; 3) perform exploratory analysis to assess  aggregate statistical power and prototype predictive models for TKI optimization. In summary, the  present project delivers a 21st century, big data approach for BCR-ABL1 leukemia to optimize  clinical management and expedite basic preclinical research. This project is highly relevant to public health as it enables a comprehensive view of BCR ABL  positive leukemia(s) that can optimize clinical management and expedite preclinical research.",A Big Data Approach to BCR ABL Leukemias,9728205,R21CA232249,"['ABL1 gene', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Animal Model', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Study', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Modeling', 'Dimensions', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Oncogenes', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sample Size', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor', 'Universities', 'Wheelchairs', 'adult leukemia', 'base', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'compliance behavior', 'data mining', 'database schema', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'drug intolerance', 'drug intolerant', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'leukemia', 'lexical', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'personalized predictions', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'rare cancer', 'relational database', 'resistance mutation', 'response', 'side effect', 'text searching', 'treatment duration']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2019,167262,0.02085381009260645
"Closing the loop: development of real-time, personalized brain stimulation Project Summary  We are in critical need of targeted and individualized treatments for mental health disorders, which affect nearly 50% of Americans during our lifetimes. Brain stimulation treatments, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), represent the front-line of innovative approaches to correct dysfunctional brain networks for patients suffering from mental illness. rTMS is FDA-approved for depression and obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) with clinical trials underway for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use, among others. However, as currently administered, rTMS lacks a biomarker to individually optimize treatment and thus suffers from a poor clinical response rate (<50%). Without personalization of rTMS, we risk a one-size-fits-all treatment for all psychiatric disorders, not dissimilar to how antidepressants are administered.  Using simultaneous TMS and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), I identified a depression severity biomarker from a double-blind randomized clinical trial treating depressed patients with one month of active or placebo rTMS. The degree of this biomarker change significantly predicted clinical improvement after rTMS treatment. Direct brain recordings further suggest that a single stimulation session is sufficient to modulate this biomarker, indicating that this brain-based biomarker can be monitored daily to support empiric treatment optimization.  With this in mind, I propose to develop the first broadly generalizable platform for real-time biomarker monitoring (Aim #1) and personalized rTMS treatment (Aims #2 & 3). I will enroll 54 depressed patients to participate in a cross-over, placebo-controlled study directly comparing personalized, adaptive rTMS to standard rTMS. Primary outcome will be target engagement and dose-response of the depression severity biomarker. Successful implementation of this work includes the early stratification of treatment responders and personalized and more effective treatments for non-responders. This approach is broadly applicable to other depression biomarkers, all psychiatric populations treated with rTMS, and other brain stimulation modalities. More generally, my goals are to establish the fundamental principles of human brain plasticity and to construct platforms for rapid biomarker development, engagement, and integration into personalized brain stimulation treatments. Project Narrative We need targeted, individualized treatments for mental health disorders, which affects nearly 50% of Americans. Brain stimulation treatments target dysfunctional brain networks with minimal side effects but are currently applied in a one-size-fits-all manner, thus limiting its efficacy. I aim to develop a non-invasive personalized brain stimulation platform for neuropsychiatric disorders; here I will create a real-time monitoring system for brain changes, evaluate the mechanism underlying these brain changes, and develop and test an adaptive stimulation paradigm to maximally drive individual brain changes and improve clinical outcome.","Closing the loop: development of real-time, personalized brain stimulation",9794069,DP5OD028128,"['Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Markers', 'Book Chapters', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Length', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'brain circuitry', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinical predictors', 'depressed patient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'journal article', 'lectures', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'off-patent', 'placebo controlled study', 'primary outcome', 'professor', 'real time monitoring', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'response', 'side effect', 'tenure track', 'time use', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment responders', 'treatment stratification']",OD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,DP5,2019,391249,0.005744827247618675
"Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy Title: Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy ABSTRACT Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, multifactorial, autoimmune disorder that affects ~1% of the worldwide population (~2 million adults in the US alone). It is characterized by chronic synovitis that, when left untreated, can result in irreversible joint destruction and deformity, leading to increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. The last three decades have witnessed impressive advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic outcomes. In fact, the use of methotrexate first, and the subsequent incorporation of anti-TNF (TNFi) and other “biologics” have led to substantial improvements in RA clinical outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for millions of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Despite this progress, however, a significant question still remains unanswered: why do over 50% of RA patients with moderate to severe arthritis fail to respond appropriately to these agents? Pharmacomicrobiomics – an emerging field of study that investigates the effect of variations within the human gut microbiome on drugs – promises to overcome these barriers and facilitate precision medicine approaches in autoimmune disease.  Methotrexate (MTX), a dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase inhibitor, remains the anchor drug for the treatment of RA and is used widely throughout the world. While quite effective, oral MTX achieves significant results in less than 50% of patients and remission in only a quarter of them. It is well established that the inter-individual bioavailability of MTX is extremely variable, ranging from 10 to 80%. The reasons for this are presumably multifactorial. However, the intestinal microbiome and its enzymatic machinery are likely to play a significant role, based on our Preliminary Results and given that animals treated with antibiotics or kept under germ-free conditions show significant differences in MTX metabolism relative to control animals.  Our multidisciplinary team composed of rheumatologists, bioinformaticians, pharmacologists and microbiome researchers will address our overarching goal to study: a) if baseline intestinal microbiome, its genes, and associated metabolites can be used to predict the immunomodulatory responses to MTX in treatment-naïve, new-onset RA (NORA) patients; and b) if the gut microbiomes of MTX non-responders can be manipulated to modulate MTX metabolism and bioavailability. We believe that the results of our highly translational, innovative studies will directly influence therapeutic approaches for the treatment of RA and offer a more personalized approach in which the clinical efficacy response would be predicted early (and potentially improved by microbiome-targeted adjuvant therapies) in any given patient about to initiate MTX, limiting or preventing disease progression and ultimately avoiding wasteful health expenditures (estimated as ~$50,000/year/patient in direct costs). Importantly, we anticipate that our studies will establish generalizable approaches in rheumatology and autoimmunity that could be more broadly applied to the study and clinical maximization of other similar small molecules (e.g., JAK inhibitors) or even biologic agents (e.g., anti-TNF mAbs). NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread musculoskeletal inflammation affecting 1% of the world’s population (including ~2 million adults in the US alone). While the use of methotrexate (MTX) has significantly improved the lives of many people with RA, over 50% of patients do not respond adequately to this drug. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide key insights into the effects of the gut bacteria on MTX and the implications for prediction of clinical response, ultimately identifying patients that are either likely to improve even before this treatment is prescribed, or those that would benefit from microbiome-targeted interventions to improve MTX absorption and efficacy.",Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy,9826831,R01AR074500,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitor', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Engraftment', 'Excess Mortality', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Role', 'Series', 'Structural Genes', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synovitis', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'arthritis therapy', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'chronic autoimmune disease', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'drug disposition', 'drug metabolism', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'germ free condition', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'joint destruction', 'joint injury', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome components', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'polyglutamates', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'rRNA Genes', 'recruit', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'rheumatologist', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'therapy outcome']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,734366,0.006481841588663211

Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Outcomes from this study will inform clinical guidelines for effective language treatment in PPA, which can be adapted for other dementia syndromes.",Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia,9686505,R01AG055425,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Aphasia', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Videoconferences', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'eHealth', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'experimental arm', 'experimental group', 'implementation research', 'language impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized care', 'premature', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'restoration', 'skills', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment response', 'trial design', 'web app']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,630166,0.04350214613214514
"Mixed-Reality Neuronavigation for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Treatment of Depression Project Summary: Overview: Depression affects more than 16 million American adults and more than half of all depression patients do not respond to medication. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an important anti- depressant treatment option that targets specific brain circuits responsible for mood and behavior. TMS efficacy and risk is strongly linked to correct TMS coil placement and can be significantly improved by accurate neuronavigation. We propose a mixed reality TMS neuronavigation setup that integrates TMS coil and patient tracking, visualization of brain anatomy and targeting feedback and neuronavigation controls in a single immersive environment. Relevance: While neuronavigation is used in certain research settings, the high cost and added time and effort for the operator lead to a very slow adoption at most TMS sites. A low cost mixed-reality TMS neuronavigation system that is easy-to-use could promote much more widespread dissemination of neuronavigation capabilities, thereby improving treatment outcomes and reducing risk to the patient. Approach: We will develop an advanced MRI protocol designed to visualize and locate brain anatomy and integrate electric field models for predicting optimal TMS coil positioning. We will optimize the use of an RGBD camera for tracking the TMS coil and the patient's head. We will test coil positioning on 20 healthy volunteers using the mixed reality and conventional desktop neuronavigation systems. Summary: This proposal aims to create a new radiological paradigm where mixed reality is used to merge medical imaging data with the real world to guide the TMS practitioner during treatment of depression. The mixed reality setup will be tested against a desktop neuronavigation device with the aim of demonstrating improved targeting speed and training performance and matched accuracy and consistency. The mixed reality neuronavigation system will provide an improved and streamlined user experience, enabling a wide-spread use of neuronavigation. Our research team includes world-class experts in radiology, virtual and augmented reality and psychiatry. Narrative   Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an important treatment option for depression but treatment efficacy depends strongly on accurate positioning of the TMS coil. Image-based neuronavigation improves treatment efficacy but is rarely used in the clinic due to the added technological burden. To promote the use of image- based neuronavigation and improve outcomes for TMS therapies and research studies, we aim to develop a low cost, easy-to-use, mixed reality treatment environment that integrates holographic brain MRI, the real world patient, controls and feedback within a single, head-mounted display.  ",Mixed-Reality Neuronavigation for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Treatment of Depression,9739255,R21MH116484,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Attention', 'Augmented Reality', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electromagnetics', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Instruction', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Evoked Potentials', 'Neuronavigation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Rotation', 'Scalp structure', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cost', 'design', 'electric field', 'experience', 'healthy volunteer', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mixed reality', 'multimodality', 'neurophysiology', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'risk minimization', 'tool', 'virtual reality', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,197981,0.039418922604776245
"Development and Validation of a Collaborative Web/Cloud-Based Dosimetry System for Radiopharmaceutical Therapy. Project Summary  Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) – the use of targeted radionuclides to deliver radiation specifically to cancer cells and their microenvironment – is a fundamentally different approach to cancer therapy that is growing, with a substantial number of large and small pharmaceuticals companies developing products in this area and radionuclide producers making substantial investments in scaling up production. This is especially true in the area of alpha emitters. The dosimetric evaluation of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals is a key requirement for regulatory approval and optimal administration of RPTs, especially in combination with external beam radiation therapy. This project will provide a cloud-based dosimetry software service, delivered through a web-browser, that includes the full complement of methods needed for dosimetry in the context of obtaining regulatory approval of RPTs and, ultimately, for optimal clinical delivery. Providing this in a cloud-based system will enable a variety of models for selling the service that do not require a large up-front capital investment for clinics or radiopharmaceutical developers. It also will provide access to expert advice, customization, and dosimetry services, and allow for collaboration between developers, dosimetry experts, and clinical sites. To accomplish the goal of developing this cloud-based web-browser-delivered RPT dosimetry software service, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Design, develop and implement a web/cloud-based integrated software system for treatment planning of RPT therapy; (2) design and implement a full server-side framework for subscription, authentication, and granting collaborative privileges for the various processes and data in the dosimetry pipeline; (3) optimize and adapt the four most computationally intensive processes for a multi-processor cloud-based compute environment; (4) apply and evaluate the toolchain developed in aims 1-3 to phantom, simulated and existing patient data. Successful completion of this project will produce a cloud-based software system delivered to the user via a web browser that provides an integrated, streamlined, robust, state-of-the-art system for RPT treatment planning. This system would enable a collaborative approach to multi-center clinical trials and eventually to clinical delivery of optimally dosed RPT. Projective Narrative  Radiopharmaceutical therapy is an emerging cancer therapy modality involving the targeted delivery of radiation to tumors using tumor-targeting molecules.

"Neurocognitive outcomes and changes in brain and CSF volume after treatment of post-infectious hydrocephalus in Ugandan infants by shunting or ETV/CPC: a randomized prospective trial We estimate 250,000 new infants develop hydrocephalus, most commonly following neonatal infection, in sub- Saharan Africa (SSA) each year. Most have poor access to treatment. We developed and validated a novel operative treatment for infant hydrocephalus combining endoscopic third ventriculostomy and choroid plexus cauterization (ETV/CPC) that avoids shunt dependence in the majority. Our prior collaborative work at CURE Children’s Hospital of Uganda (CCHU) supported equipoise between shunt placement and ETV/CPC in regard to 5-year survival and development. That ETV/CPC prevents shunt dependence among those with no urgent access for shunt malfunction is compelling, but we do not know which treatment optimizes development. We seek to confirm the optimal treatment selection paradigm. Using CT-based measures we found that brain and CSF volume discriminated neurocognitive outcome, providing a promising objective measure of hydrocephalus treatment efficacy. Preliminary data from our R-21 and R01 funded randomized controlled trial (RCT) of ETV/CPC vs. shunt for PIH treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT01936272) have shown no important differences at one year in regard to safety, efficacy, developmental outcome, or brain growth Those achieving normal or near-normal brain volume by 1 year, regardless of preop volume, had the best outcome. The current proposal seeks to accomplish the following aims: 1) test the hypothesis that endoscopic treatment of PIH is better than or equal to shunt placement in regard to five-year neurocognitive development; 2) further develop CCHU as a neuroscience research facility; 3) develop the in-country capacity for sustainable ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI imaging; 4) install optimized ULF-MRI at CCHU; 5) Correlate MRI-derived brain/CSF volume metrics with long-term neurocognitive development following PIH treatment. As planned, the RCT patient study cohort will undergo further developmental assessment using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III) at 24 months post- operatively along with repeat CT-based brain and CSF volume metrics. In the current proposal, developmental assessment will be conducted at 5 years post-treatment using the Vineland-III, as well as an assessment of quality of life. After developing Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) as an ULF-MRI demonstration and resource center, ULF-MRI will be installed at CCHU for evaluation as a volumetric and diagnostic tool compared to CT. Neurocognitive outcome will be correlated with pre- and post-operative MRI- based brain/CSF volumes and treatment modality. Extension of the study will determine whether non-inferiority of ETV/CPC to shunt in regard to developmental outcome and brain growth persists at 5 years post-treatment, whether MRI-based volume metrics effectively supplant CT-based measures, and whether brain and CSF volumetrics prove useful in guiding optimal clinical management. The proposed project will determine whether ETV/CPC is the preferred initial treatment and will further develop research capacity at CCHU. Project Narrative We have established neonatal postinfectious hydrocephalus (PIH) as a major public health problem in East Africa for which there are two strategies of treatment – shunting versus endoscopic third ventriculostomy + choroid plexus cauterization (ETV/CPC), which we developed – with no definitive evidence supporting which therapy is optimal. Our randomized controlled trial of ETV/CPC vs. shunt for PIH has shown no difference in success rate, developmental outcome or brain growth at one year following treatment, with better outcome among those demonstrating “catch-up” brain growth after treatment. We here propose extended follow up of the existing study cohort to analyze early childhood development at 5 years after treatment and to implement new sustainable ultra-low-field MRI technology for brain and CSF volume metrics to provide an evidence- based foundation for better treatment of such children.",Neurocognitive outcomes and changes in brain and CSF volume after treatment of post-infectious hydrocephalus in Ugandan infants by shunting or ETV/CPC: a randomized prospective trial,9751092,R01HD085853,"['7 year old', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Aftercare', 'Age-Months', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cauterize', 'Child', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Environment', 'Equipoise', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Human Resources', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Infrastructure', 'Libraries', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Neonatal', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-of-Life Assessment', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure of choroid plexus', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Uganda', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ventriculostomy', 'Work', 'base', 'brain volume', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'design', 'early childhood', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'neonatal infection', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research facility', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,10000,0.016745778670327713
"Machine Learning and Deep Learning Solutions Supplement: Matching Methods for Causal Inference with Complex Data NARRATIVE SUMMARY The landscape of data formats is rapidly expanding, with image, text and other complex formats becoming available for health related outcomes. By considering such data within the context of observational causal inference, they can be leveraged to improve clinical decisions, help evaluate treatment efficacy by estimating individualized treatment effects and help develop intelligent therapeutic systems where individualized treatments can be deployed. In R01EB025021, we concentrate on understanding how nearly exact matching can be achieved in the presence of a large number of categorical covariates. The proposed approach (called FLAME - Fast Large Almost Matching Exactly) is able to quickly learn which categorical covariates are important and to produce high quality matches \citep{wang2017flame,dieng2018collapsing}. The main shortfall in the proposed work for R01EB025021 is that it does not naturally extend to more complex data types, it only works for categorical data in which each feature is meaningful. {\bf This proposal will develop new statistical and computational tools for causal analysis of complex data structures.} Our new approach is called {\emph Matching After Learning to Stretch (MALTS)}. For each unit (e.g. patient), we propose learn a latent representation of their covariate information and a distance metric on the latent space such that units that are matched tend to provide accurate estimates of treatment effect. MALTS can use deep learning to encode the latent representations for the units, or it can learn basis transformations in linear space (stretching and rotation matrices) for simpler continuous data types. We will develop the MALTS algorithm, and apply it in a medical context. Our goal is to construct high quality matches for the following types of data: (i) medical images, such as x-rays and CT scans, (ii) medical record data, (iii) time series data (continuous EEG data), (iv) a combination of any of the first three types of data. We aim to leverage the newly developed tools to continue our evaluation of the efficacy of isolation for flu-like ailments as well as to apply them more broadly to publicly available modern datasets such as the MIMIC III database. Reliable and consistent causal analysis of public health interventions requires the use of massive previously unavailable datastreams. For example, evaluation of the efficacy of isolation interventions on flu-like-illness spread must include information on friendships and interactions between individuals, biometric information, imaging, longitudinal health record data as well as standard demographic data. The proposed research provides machine learning and deep learning tools for properly employing this data for the identification and quantification of causal effects of such treatments that can lead to the development of better public health interventions.",Machine Learning and Deep Learning Solutions Supplement: Matching Methods for Causal Inference with Complex Data,9750434,R01EB025021,"['Algorithms', 'Biometry', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Electroencephalography', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Series', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'computerized tools', 'data format', 'deep learning', 'efficacy evaluation', 'flu', 'health record', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'novel strategies', 'public health intervention', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,98714,0.01363242980260115
"HEART: Adding Memory to Reasoning: macHine lEArning tailoRed drug Titration Hypertension (HTN) affects 73 million Americans, with an annual hospitalization cost of $113 billion/year. Clinical trial outcomes of optima4BP (O4BP), a clinical reasoning artificial intelligence (AI) system, determined that the success/failure of past anti-HTN medication treatments can be utilized to improve O4BP predictive performance. Our objective for this Phase I proposal is to investigate the feasibility of building a past treatment success/failure “memory” function into O4BP. O4BP, an innovation of Optima Integrated Health, is functional at UC San Francisco Medical Center (UCSF MC), the clinical collaborating partner. O4BP AI safely optimizes HTN medication treatment independent of in-office visits. It collects and analyzes current patient health information from multiple sources to determine if a medication optimization is required. O4BP then alerts the physician of a need for a medication change by providing a clinically supported treatment recommendation action. In this Phase I, we propose the development and validation of O4BP's “memory” by using the principles of Instance Based Learning (IBL). Known for its flexibility and intuitive logic, the IBL theory will be adapted to enhance the predictive treatment efficacy power of O4BP. It will lead to incorporating the patient response (success/failure) from past treatments to rank the efficacy of candidate treatments identified by O4BP for HTN medication optimization. Clinical resources [e.g., Electronic Health Record (EHR)] provide incomplete patient information, insufficient to build the “memory” functionality using retrospective datasets. Therefore, in Aim 1, a clinical trial (n=50) will be conducted to collect complete patient datasets that will be used to build the “memory” function: (a) BP data from remotely monitored BP; (b) EHR updates to the patient's profile since last cycle data dump; and (c) personalized online surveys for patient reporting of medication adherence, side- effects (SEs), and cardiovascular symptoms. Aim 2 will utilize the datasets to develop an efficacy proximity map 2x/month of candidate treatments to past treatments using IBL theory. The proximity map will be based on scored past treatment(s) efficacy, defined as a combination of success in BP lowering, reducing of SEs, and targeting minimum number of drugs with maximum BP lowering power. The treatment recommendation alert will be sent to the physician, for consideration. This study design allows immediate clinical adjudication of the IBL “memory” through physician's choice to implement/reject the treatment action alert, made available 2x/month for each patient. “Memory” enhanced O4BP is expected to lead to a systolic BP (SBP) reduction ≥10mmHg by the end of the scheduled 12 months treatment optimization period. Successful development and validation will position the “memory” enhanced O4BP for deployment at UCSF MC that serves approximately 20,000 patients with an SBP >160mmHg, poorly controlled, and at high risk for primary or recurrent stroke, heart failure or myocardial infarction. Our long-term objective is to transform the reactive and punctuated nature of HTN medication treatment management into a proactive and ongoing component of patient care. Our goal is to simplify the medication management of high blood pressure (BP) for the treating physician while improving the quality of care of patients and reducing the associated costs. We will develop an artificial processing intelligence that will allow our current product, optima4BP, to enhance its efficacy evaluation of candidate medication treatments as a function of past treatments performance. optima4BP is a decision support clinical reasoning artificial intelligence designed to safely optimize medication treatment by a physician, independent of in-office visits in patients with poorly controlled BP.",HEART: Adding Memory to Reasoning: macHine lEArning tailoRed drug Titration,9461180,R43HL140624,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intelligence', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'San Francisco', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Validation', 'adjudication', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical efficacy', 'college', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'design', 'efficacy evaluation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'profiles in patients', 'response', 'stroke incidence', 'success', 'system architecture', 'theories', 'treatment optimization', 'vector']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R43,2018,224090,0.030916831578158426
"Therapeutic Approaches to Dysarthria:  Acoustic and Perceptual Correlates ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 90% of the 1.5 million Americans living with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and 50% of the 500,000 Americans living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) will experience dysarthria. Dysarthria has devastating consequences for life quality and participation in society due to its effects on employment, leisure activities and social relationships. Knowledge of therapy techniques for maximizing perceived speech adequacy, as indexed by the gold standard perceptual construct of intelligibility is thus of vital importance. Owing to the scarcity of impartial comparative studies, the choice of one technique over others is often based on trial and error or reflects clinician bias, both of which are at odds with evidence-based practice. This project has sought to address this critical gap in knowledge regarding the comparative merits of dysarthria treatment techniques since its inception. Toward this end, published studies from the past funding cycle compared the acoustic and perceptual merits of three common, global dysarthria treatment techniques including 1) rate manipulation, 2) an increased vocal intensity and 3) clear speech in MS and PD as well as age and sex matched neurotypical talkers. Global treatment techniques by their very nature elicit co-occurring acoustic changes (e.g., duration, segmental articulation). Because an explanatory, acoustically-based model of intelligibility is lacking, the acoustic change(s) causing or explainin the improved perceptual outcomes of global treatment techniques are unknown. Determining the acoustic variables explaining intelligibility variation in dysarthria would not only tremendousy advance theoretical understanding of intelligibility but also would strengthen the scientific basis for treatment. Treatment focused on those acoustic variables explanatory for improved intelligibility may further accelerate progress in therapy. Importantly, research from the previous funding cycle suggests the promise of speech analysis-resynthesis for identifying segmental and suprasegmental acoustic variables explanatory for intelligibility in dysarthria. Building upon this work, the overarching goal of the continuation is to contribute towards development of an acoustically-based explanatory model of intelligibility. Our approach 1) employs established perceptual procedures and acoustic measures, 2) uses an innovative analysis-resynthesis technique that permits conclusions concerning the explanatory relationship between acoustic changes accompanying dysarthria therapy techniques and intelligibility, and 3) leverages methods from machine learning to build a predictive model of intelligibility from acoustics. The impact of this work is in its contribution to 1) advancing conceptual understanding of intelligibility, 2) strengthening the scientific basis for treatment, and 3) optimizing clinical implementation of dysarthria therapy techniques. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is directly relevant to the mission of NIDCD due to its focus on investigating the therapeutic techniques for maximizing intelligibility in dysarthra secondary to Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis. By advancing conceptual understanding of intelligibility, this research will strengthen the scientific basis for dysarthria treatments and will optimize their clinical implementation.",Therapeutic Approaches to Dysarthria:  Acoustic and Perceptual Correlates,9549036,R01DC004689,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Articulation', 'Comparative Study', 'Development', 'Dysarthria', 'Employment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Idiopathic Parkinson Disease', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Leisure Activities', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clear speech', 'clinical implementation', 'comparative', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment program']",NIDCD,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2018,517281,-0.0014407719690646195
"Statistical and Machine Learning Methods for Integrating Clinical and Multimodal Imaging Data to Select Optimal Antidepressant Treatment Summary: The public health burden of major depressive disorder (MDD) is immense and current approaches for selecting antidepressant treatment have had limited success. By some estimates, fewer than one in three MDD patients will respond to their prescribed antidepressant and the quest for a treatment that will work is typically characterized by a lengthy course of trial-and-error. The need to identify patient characteristics (biomarkers) that can be used to objectively select personalized antidepressant treatment is clear. Accordingly, large clinical studies like the NIMH-funded Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) study have collected massive amounts of baseline measures including those from various neuroimaging sources in the hope that some can be used to guide antidepressant treatment selection. These data bring with them many statistical challenges that have yet to be effectively addressed. These challenges include (1) dealing with high-dimensionality, (2) handling data missingness, and (3) determining how best to simultaneously model relationships between measures from multiple imaging modalities and the response of interest. The goal of this project is to acquire the essential training and experience to make significant progress in this area by addressing each of these challenges. Aim 1 of this project will employ state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning algorithms and targeted estimation to identify moderators of antidepressant treatment effect using scalar clinical, demographic, and summary neuroimaging data from clinical trials of antidepressant treatments, including EMBARC. Strategies for handling missing data in this context will also be investigated and guidelines on best practices will be proposed. Aim 2 will extend the methods used in Aim 1 and develop user-friendly software to directly incorporate high- dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data into treatment decision rules. Included in this aim will be an investigation into best practices for handling missing high-dimensional imaging data in the context of estimating treatment decision rules. Aim 3 will employ the novel methods developed in Aim 2 and the estimated treatment decision rules will be evaluated and compared with those developed in Aim 1. I have put together a training program that directly supports the completion of these research aims. It includes instruction, mentoring, and hands-on-experience (1) in psychopathology and the neural basis for psychiatric disorders and treatment for those disorders; (2) in the use of neuroimaging data to understand depression and response to antidepressant treatment; (3) in the use of modern algorithms to store, process, manipulate, and analyze big biomedical data like those arising in multimodal neuroimaging studies. This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the training, time, and resources to be able to make substantial progress in addressing this important problem and will provide the skills and experience that will be crucial in my transition to an independent investigator. ! Public Health Relevance Statement: This proposal seeks to advance precision medicine through the development of new statistical methods that integrate clinical, demographic, and high-dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data to estimate treatment decision rules. The proposed research and training are laid out in the context of depression but the statistical tools to be developed will be general enough for constructing treatment decision rules for a wide array of diseases using a variety of data types. These statistical tools have the potential to reduce the burden of diseases like depression by providing personalized treatment that has the best chance for success.",Statistical and Machine Learning Methods for Integrating Clinical and Multimodal Imaging Data to Select Optimal Antidepressant Treatment,9527395,K01MH113850,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroencephalography', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Instruction', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sertraline', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'Writing', 'big biomedical data', 'biosignature', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'data reduction', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging modality', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,165149,0.06631404389688374
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS), relevant biological predictors, and precision treatment response trajectories.",Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress,9612862,R01MH116156,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Trauma patient', 'Trauma recovery', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'combat', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'federated computing', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'post-traumatic stress', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'stress related disorder', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'treatment planning', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,547853,0.02275032214162706
"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy in a double-blinded study of 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Additional aims are to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment and identify the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of using modern neuroimaging techniques.",Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis,9596726,R01DC016800,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Randomized', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Work', 'aphasia recovery', 'behavioral neurology', 'clinical investigation', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroregulation', 'predicting response', 'primary outcome', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,609151,-0.004362560227665205
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,9427988,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomarker performance', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2018,162800,0.0002953031899878654
"Integrative Learning to Combine Evidence for Personalized Treatment Strategies. Project Summary:  Mental disorders represent immense healthcare burdens. Intense efforts and resources have been devoted to developing pharmacological and behavioral treatments for mental disorders, but no universally effective treatments are available. Considerable heterogeneity exists in treatment response among individuals with mental disorders, in part because an individual patient's psychosocial characteristics and/or biomarkers are not accounted for when selecting among available treatment options. Barriers to implement personalized treatments in clinical psychiatry include a lack of evidence-based, clinically interpretable, individualized treatment rules (ITRs), a lack of power to detect treatment modiﬁers from a single study, and a lack of reproducibility for treatment rules estimated from single studies. We propose analytic solutions to tackle these barriers. Speciﬁcally, we will provide integrative machine learning methods to build powerful, yet interpretable, individualized treatment strategies that can be easily applied in clinical practice. We will integrate evidence of ITRs identiﬁed in multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to increase robustness and reproducibility. In Aim 1, we will provide piece-wise linear decision trees that are trans- parent, interpretable, and that have guaranteed performance. Our decision trees will simultaneously identify the optimal treatment for a given patient (qualitative interaction) and subgroups of patients with large beneﬁt (quan- titative interaction). In Aim 2, we propose a novel integrative analysis to synthesize evidence across trials and provide an integrative ITR that improves efﬁciency and reproducibility. Our method does not require all studies to collect common sets of variables and thus allows evidence to be combined from ITRs identiﬁed in recent RCTs that collected emerging biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging measures) with earlier RCTs that focused on clinical and be- havioral markers. In response to the National Institute of Mental Health Strategic Plan on Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to center mental health research around “dimensional psychological constructs” shared across disorders, the methods will be applied to a wide range of RCTs that recruited patients with major depressive disorder and other co-morbid mental disorders. This strategy allows examination of ITRs for constructs shared across disorders and will increase generalizability. We will apply our methods to various RCTs, including data available from the Na- tional Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Illness. This research will bridge approaches for personalized medicine and integrative analysis in an effort to better understand the complex interplay between biomarkers and clinical manifestations in the context of selecting the best treatments for patients with mental disorders. Project Narrative:  Treatment responses for mental disorders are inadequate and considerable heterogeneity is observed, in part because an individual patient's clinical, psychosocial, and/or biological markers are not accounted for when select- ing treatments among available options. This research proposes novel analytic methods to discover new powerful, yet interpretable personalized treatment strategies and integrate evidence of strategies identiﬁed in multiple prior studies to increase robustness and reproducibility.",Integrative Learning to Combine Evidence for Personalized Treatment Strategies.,9581848,R21MH117458,"['Age', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bulimia', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Psychiatry', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'analytical method', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical practice', 'demographics', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'mental health center', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient subsets', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sex', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2018,202500,0.05057014955090037
"Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support PROJECT SUMMARY Treatments for mental health conditions such as unipolar depression provide modest average benefit but have wide variation between individuals and within individuals over time. Evidence-based customized treatment protocols would improve the mental health care of many people by providing treatment recommendations for individuals that take into account potential variation because of personal characteristics such as current health status, symptoms, and response to earlier treatment. Generating customized treatment protocols requires large amounts of data, such as from networks of health systems that can link electronic health records from millions of individuals. Current statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols are limited in three important ways.  First, current approaches rely on scientists to select the patient characteristics to use to customize treatments instead of using data to find the patient characteristics that will lead to improved, customized care. Second, customized treatment protocols discovered with current statistical methods assume no unobserved differences between individuals who receive various treatment options. Third, investigators do not have ways to know if the available data contain enough information to discover and compare customized treatment protocols precisely enough to make clinical decisions. We will address these three limitations by developing new statistical tools for discovering customized treatment protocols using electronic health records data. Our research team has expertise and experience in statistics, epidemiology, and mental health care. We will integrate methods that have been successfully used in other settings to improve statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols and address these three important limitations.  We will extend machine learning tools for selecting important pieces of information to the time-varying data structure required for discovering customized treatment protocols. We will build approaches that use available knowledge about the size of unobserved differences between groups of people who received different treatments to assess how those differences change study results. By building on the math used to estimate the sample sizes needed for precision in randomized trials with complex designs, we will develop new formulas for determining how many people with a particular condition and who took a particular drug are needed in a health system to provide enough accurate information to discover customized treatment protocols.  Using data from the electronic health records of more than 15,000 patients, we will discover customized treatment protocols for depression. By improving statistical tools and addressing current limitations, our customized treatment protocols will have immediate impact for people living with unipolar depression. The statistical tools we develop will also be useful for discovering customized treatment protocols for people with a wide variety of mental health conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE People living with mental health conditions and their health care providers often lack evidence for making choices about numerous treatment options and they do not have evidence-based, customized treatment plans. This project will develop customized treatment plans for unipolar depression and methods to generate these plans using data from electronic health care records. This work will address current limitations in statistical methods for selecting patient characteristics for customizing treatment, assessing bias from differences between people who take different medications, and calculating how many people are needed to accurately compare customized treatment plans using data from electronic health records.",Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support,9593316,R01MH114873,"['13 year old', 'Address', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sequential Treatment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical implementation', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'novel', 'practice setting', 'precision medicine', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,390422,0.06020190366639218
"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary/Abstract  Current medical treatment guidelines largely rely on data from randomized controlled trials that study av- erage effects, which may be inadequate for making individualized decisions for real-world patients. Large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) data provide unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized treatment strategies and generate evidence relevant to real-world patients. However, there are inherent challenges in the use of EHRs, including non-experimental nature of data collection processes, heterogeneous data types with complex dependencies, irregular measurement patterns, multiple dynamic treatment sequences, and the need to balance risk and beneﬁt of treatments. Using two high-quality EHR databases, Columbia University Medical Center's clinical data warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care database, and focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D), this proposal will develop novel and scalable statistical learning approaches that overcome these challenges to discover optimal personalized treatment strategies for T2D from real-world patients. Speciﬁcally, under Aim 1, we will develop a uniﬁed framework to learn latent temporal processes for feature extraction and dynamic patient records representation. Our approach will accommodate large-scale variables of mixed types (continuous, binary, counts) measured at irregular intervals. They extract lower-dimensional components to reﬂect patients' dynamic health status, account for informative healthcare documentation processes, and characterize similarities between patients. Under Aim 2, we will develop fast and efﬁcient multi-category machine learning methods, in order to evaluate treatment propensities and adaptively learn optimal dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) among the extensive number of treatment options observed in the EHRs. The methods will provide se- quential decisions that determine the best treatment sequence for a T2D patient given his/her EHRs. Under Aim 3, we will develop statistical learning methods to assist multi-faceted treatment decision-making, which balances risks versus beneﬁts when evaluating a DTR. Our approach will ensure maximizing beneﬁt to the greatest extent while controlling all risk outcomes under the safety margins. For all aims, we will develop efﬁcient stochastic resampling algorithms to scale up the optimization for massive data sizes. We will identify optimal DTRs for T2D using the extracted information from patients' comorbidity conditions, medications, and laboratory tests, as well as records-collection processes. Our methodologies will be applied and cross-validated between the two EHR databases. The treatment strategies learned from the representative EHR databases with a diverse patient pop- ulation will be beneﬁcial for individual patient care, assisting clinicians to adaptively choose the optimal treatment for a patient. Finally, we will disseminate our methods and results through freely available software and outreach to the informatics and clinical experts at our Centers for Translational Science and elsewhere. Project Narrative  This proposal aims to develop novel and scalable statistical learning methods to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) and use two real-world, high-quality EHR databases for personalized medicine research. The methods will handle the non-experimental nature of data collection processes, along with heterogeneous data types, dynamic treatment sequences, and the trade-off between benefit and risk outcomes.

"RADIOMICS-BASED PROGNOSTIC MODEL OF CERVICAL CANCER HABITATS Abstract Despite significant advances in disease prevention and screening, locally-advanced cervical cancer (LACC) continues to be an important world-wide public health problem. Responses to currently available treatments are highly variable among patients with similar constellations of accepted prognostic features, implying that chemo-radio sensitivity, patterns of local tumor proliferation, and the propensity of metastatic spread are highly dependent on each patient's potentially unique cervix cancer habitat. Radiomic analysis of pre-, in-, and post- treatment medical images is an exciting new class of prognostic cancer biomarkers for characterizing tumor habit and has shown promise in more accurately separating favorable- from unfavorable- prognosis for patients for several tumor sites. No such radiomic-based prognostic model has been developed, for LACC that supports meaningful personalization of local and systemic treatment or biologically treatment adaptation based on response of radiomic biomarker profiles to the initial fractions of radiotherapy. To support future personalized chemo-radiation therapy, we propose to exploit a large, prospectively collected database of ~400 LACC patients consisting of archived PET, MRI, and CT images, standard biomarkers, and clinical outcomes to develop an innovative and accurate radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting LACC treatment outcomes. Previous efforts to utilize high-dimensional radiomic feature spaces to predict cancer treatment outcomes have been compromised by small patient numbers relative to the feature space dimensionality; radiomic feature redundancy, feature heterogeneity and uncertainty; unbalanced outcome class patient cohorts; and intrinsic differences in prognostic information content for features extracted from different modality images. We propose a principled and systematic strategy to address these challenges: a novel combination of belief function theory (BFT) and more standard machine learning techniques. To achieve these goals, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: Develop a novel radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting outcomes of cervical cancer patients treated with definitive chemo-radiotherapy given longitudinal radiomic features from pre-, in-, and post treatment PET, CT, and MR images. Aim 2: Refine the developed prognostic model by use of the full 400 patient cases and systematically validate and test its performance. Aim 3: Investigate the potential clinical impact of the radiomic-based prognostic model and selected clinical applications. Clinical Impact and future plans: This project will result in a clinically useful family of models for predicting disease control outcomes from current LACC treatments. This clinical decision-making tool can be used to personalize initial treatment prescriptions as well as adaptive treatment prescription when combined with in-treatment radiomic biomarkers. We anticipate that many of the proposed methodological improvements investigated by this proposal will improve tumor response assessment in other disease sites. Narrative This project will result in a clinically useful family of models for predicting disease control outcomes from current locally advanced cervical cancer treatments. This clinical decision-making tool can be used to personalize initial treatment prescriptions as well as adaptive treatment prescription when combined with in- treatment radiomic biomarkers.

"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes.

"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for Chagas disease Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Project Summary:  Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these chal- lenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymor- phisms, whole brain neuroimaging, bioﬂuids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mecha- nisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Speciﬁcally, in Aim 1, we develop efﬁcient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation mod- els to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efﬁciency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-speciﬁc substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic sys- tems through ordinary differential equations with random inﬂections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker proﬁles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efﬁcient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individu- alized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest beneﬁt from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art ana- lytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research com- munity. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9502388,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,340491,0.014943574549438543
"Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response PROJECT SUMMARY The growing expansion of the approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and the variable responses to MS treatment have created an unmet medical need to provide individually tailored therapy. Efforts to bring precision medicine to provide individualized MS treatment selection have been impeded by our limited understanding of the factors that determine treatment response. While genomics hold the promise for closing this knowledge gap, the insufficient number of patients with detailed treatment response data and the modest effect size of genetic variants that influence treatment responses are the main limiting factors in pharmacogenomics studies. As electronic health records (EHR) become widely adopted and increasingly standardized and as we implement sophisticated computational and statistical methods to harness the EHR data, EHR systems can become cost-effective platforms to perform large-scale treatment response studies in real-life settings. Our team with a history of productive collaborations and diverse expertise (led by PI Dr. Xia) previously developed robust algorithms to identify 5,495 MS patients from the Partners HealthCare EHR systems and then model MS disease activity in these patients using EHR data. The Partners EHR system contains longitudinal clinical information on thousands of MS patients from two large academic medical centers and is linked to a well-characterized MS patient research registry and biobanks with existing genomics data. For the proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that meaningful phenotypes of MS disease activity can be extracted from EHR data to inform treatment response, and that additional common genetic variants exist in the population and can predict therapeutic response in MS when combined with clinical features derived from EHR data. The proposed study has three aims with the overall goal to produce a computational and analytic approach capable of identifying MS disease activity in relation to treatment history using EHR data and integrate with genomics profile to develop a predictive model of therapeutic response to commonly prescribed DMTs in this cohort of 5,495 MS patients, including injectable (interferon-β, glatiramer acetate) and oral (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) options. Specifically, we will (1) leverage narrative electronic health records data (e.g., clinical notes, radiology reports) and natural language processing (NLP) to ascertain individualized response to DMTs (n=600 for each DMT); (2) Identify clinical features from electronic health record data (e.g., diagnoses, exposures) that predict response to DMTs using a systematic phenome-wide approach; (3) Develop and test a comprehensive predictive model of individualized response to DMTs that incorporates clinical and genetic predictors. This research has the potential impact to be transformative by contributing to a major knowledge gap regarding the factors that influence treatment response and bringing precision medicine closer to individualized MS treatment selection. PROJECT NARRATIVE AND PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition that affects over 400,000 individuals in the United States and creates a high socioeconomic burden as a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Because not all patients respond the same way to a specific medication, physicians and MS patients often lose precious time searching for effective treatment with serially testing of costly medications. An individually tailored treatment can ensure early start of effective medication that can prevent relapse and progression of disability. Ultimately, this project will help gain insights into the factors that determine treatment response and enable physicians to match an individual MS patient's clinical and genomic profile with uniquely tailored therapy to maximize effectiveness, delay disease progression and reduce overall cost.",Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response,9509579,R01NS098023,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Fumarates', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injectable', 'Interferon-beta', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'copolymer 1', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'individual response', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'patient response', 'phenome', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,344656,0.04333817380195944
"Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients ABSTRACT  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder that likely involves multiple underlying pathological mechanisms, which has plagued attempts to identify rational therapeutic targets. All available antipsychotic drugs (APD) are dopamine receptor antagonists, but clinical response is variable, with a third of patients being partial responders, and a third non-responders. Arguably, those who respond well to APD have primarily dopaminergic abnormalities but it is imperative to also characterize the specific underlying pathologies in those with poor response in order to unravel the heterogeneity of psychosis and effectively develop new treatments. We propose to longitudinally follow treatment response to APD for eight months in medication-naïve first episode psychosis (FEP) subjects using complementary brain imaging techniques.  We already have identified provisional markers for several different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychosis, including abnormalities in glutamate, brain connectivity, and neurodevelopment that we can track with brain imaging. In addition, we propose to study the changes that occur in the brain in early compared to delayed treatment responders and changes that occur over time in response to treatment. By characterizing treatment trajectories and their relationship to baseline pathophysiologic alterations, we will further complement our mechanistic understanding of the heterogeneity of psychosis.  We propose to study 60 well-characterized FEP subjects who are medication naïve and treat them with the most frequently used APD for 32 weeks. We will follow a rigorous longitudinal design to capture treatment response whereby those without an adequate response after 16 weeks of treatment will be switched to another APD for 16 weeks. All patients will be scanned four times: at baseline and after 6, 16, and 32 weeks of treatment. We will use (1) proton MR Spectroscopy (MRS), (2) task and resting state functional MRI and (3) MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to measure brain biochemistry, function and structure. Using several imaging modalities has the potential to interrogate different neurobiological aspects of treatment response and will offer greater opportunities for clustering the patterns and combinations of the underlying pathologies in those with poor response.  Deconstructing the heterogeneity of psychosis has broad implications for the identification of specific targets for drug development, and to lay the groundwork needed to conduct therapeutic trials on patients characterized by their specific underlying psychopathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder and present treatment only works for a limited number of patients. In order to identify new therapeutic targets, we will longitudinally characterize the underlying pathologies in those with poor treatment response using complimentary brain imaging modalities.",Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients,9521079,R01MH113800,"['Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Biochemistry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine Antagonists', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Protons', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Risperidone', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'aripiprazole', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain abnormalities', 'cingulate cortex', 'drug development', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'longitudinal design', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'new therapeutic target', 'patient subsets', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2018,735068,0.026619623694606843
"Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of high throughput biological data. Effective methods for analyzing this data must balance two opposing ideals. They must be (a) flexible and sufficiently data-adaptive to deal with the data's complex structure, yet (b) sufficiently simpe and transparent to interpret their results and analyze their uncertainty (so as not to mislead with conviction). This is additionally challenging because these datasets are massive, so attacking these problems requires a marriage of statistical and computational ideas. This project develops frameworks for attacking several problems involving this biological data. These frameworks balance flexibility and simplicity and are computationally tractable even on massive datasets. This application has three specific aims. Aim 1: A flexible and computationally tractable framework for building predictive models. Commonly we are interested in modelling phenotypic traits of an individual using omics data. We would like to find a small subset of genetic features which are important in phenotype expression level. In this approach, I propose a method for flexibly modelling a response variable (e.g. phenotype) with a small, adaptively chosen subset of features, in a computationally scalable fashion. Aim 2: A framework for jointly identifying and testing regions which differ across conditions. For example, in the context of methylation data measured in normal and cancer tissue samples, one might expect that some regions are more methylated in one tissue type or the other. These regions might suggest targets for therapy. However, we do not have the background biological knowledge to pre-specify regions to test. I propose an approach which adaptively selects regions and then tests them in a principled way. This approach is based on a convex formulation to the problem, using shrinkage to achieve sparse differences. Aim 3: A principled framework for developing and evaluating predictive biomarkers during clinical trials. Modern treatments target specific genetic abnormalities that are generally present in only a subset of patients with a disease. A major current goal in medicine is to develop biomarkers that identify those patients likely to benefit from treatment. I propose a framework for developing and testing biomarkers during large-scale clinical trials. This framework simultaneously builds these biomarkers and applies them to restrict enrollment into the trial to only those likely to benefit from treatment. The statistical tools that result from th proposed research will be implemented in freely available software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent advances in high-throughput biotechnology have provided us with a wealth of new biological data, a large step towards unlocking the tantalizing promise of personalized medicine: the tailoring of treatment to the genetic makeup of each individual and disease. However, classical statistical and computational tools have proven unable to exploit the extensive information these new experimental technologies bring to bear. This project focuses on building new flexible, data-adaptive tools to translate this wealth of low level information into actionable discoveries, and actual biological understanding.",Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics,9559432,DP5OD019820,"['Address', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Formulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Polynomial Models', 'Population', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telomerase', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'convict', 'data to knowledge', 'flexibility', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic signature', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput analysis', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP5,2018,325325,0.01813965681872481
"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particular, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group.

"Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program “Optimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasis”constitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC “Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis” will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities OVERVIEW NARRATIVE Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment.

"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Outcomes from this study will inform clinical guidelines for effective language treatment in PPA, which can be adapted for other dementia syndromes.",Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia,9564053,R01AG055425,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Aphasia', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Videoconferences', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'eHealth', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'experimental arm', 'experimental group', 'implementation research', 'language impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized care', 'premature', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'restoration', 'skills', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment response', 'trial design', 'web app']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,709956,0.04350214613214514
"Mixed-Reality Neuronavigation for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Treatment of Depression Project Summary: Overview: Depression affects more than 16 million American adults and more than half of all depression patients do not respond to medication. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an important anti- depressant treatment option that targets specific brain circuits responsible for mood and behavior. TMS efficacy and risk is strongly linked to correct TMS coil placement and can be significantly improved by accurate neuronavigation. We propose a mixed reality TMS neuronavigation setup that integrates TMS coil and patient tracking, visualization of brain anatomy and targeting feedback and neuronavigation controls in a single immersive environment. Relevance: While neuronavigation is used in certain research settings, the high cost and added time and effort for the operator lead to a very slow adoption at most TMS sites. A low cost mixed-reality TMS neuronavigation system that is easy-to-use could promote much more widespread dissemination of neuronavigation capabilities, thereby improving treatment outcomes and reducing risk to the patient. Approach: We will develop an advanced MRI protocol designed to visualize and locate brain anatomy and integrate electric field models for predicting optimal TMS coil positioning. We will optimize the use of an RGBD camera for tracking the TMS coil and the patient's head. We will test coil positioning on 20 healthy volunteers using the mixed reality and conventional desktop neuronavigation systems. Summary: This proposal aims to create a new radiological paradigm where mixed reality is used to merge medical imaging data with the real world to guide the TMS practitioner during treatment of depression. The mixed reality setup will be tested against a desktop neuronavigation device with the aim of demonstrating improved targeting speed and training performance and matched accuracy and consistency. The mixed reality neuronavigation system will provide an improved and streamlined user experience, enabling a wide-spread use of neuronavigation. Our research team includes world-class experts in radiology, virtual and augmented reality and psychiatry. Narrative   Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an important treatment option for depression but treatment efficacy depends strongly on accurate positioning of the TMS coil. Image-based neuronavigation improves treatment efficacy but is rarely used in the clinic due to the added technological burden. To promote the use of image- based neuronavigation and improve outcomes for TMS therapies and research studies, we aim to develop a low cost, easy-to-use, mixed reality treatment environment that integrates holographic brain MRI, the real world patient, controls and feedback within a single, head-mounted display.  ",Mixed-Reality Neuronavigation for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Treatment of Depression,9606910,R21MH116484,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Attention', 'Augmented Reality', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electromagnetics', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Instruction', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Evoked Potentials', 'Neuronavigation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Rotation', 'Scalp structure', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cost', 'design', 'electric field', 'experience', 'healthy volunteer', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'neurophysiology', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'risk minimization', 'tool', 'virtual reality', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,251481,0.039418922604776245
"Human nasal epithelial organoids as a non-invasive, personalized model for predicting effectiveness of CFTR modulators in cystic fibrosis patients Project Summary  The discovery of the single gene (CFTR) responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF) has been transformational in focusing treatment efforts on the development and approval of drugs that restore the function of the CFTR protein. Excellent clinical response for CF patients with “gating” mutations is observed following treatment with the CFTR modulator drug ivacaftor (VX-770); however, for the remaining ~95% of patients, no effective treatments exist. More than two thousand different CFTR mutations, combined with other genetic and environmental factors, result in significant variability in response among individuals to a single therapy. To improve the clinical outcome for all CF patients, it is important that patient-specific in vivo features of CF are faithfully reproduced in vitro for predictive screening assays. To meet that need we have developed a novel organoid-based screening platform, Sphera™, using cells derived from a patient’s nasal epithelia. Sphera couples patient-specific organoids with an integrated assessment of CFTR function, including organoid morphology and viscoelastic characterization of luminal mucus using our proprietary microrheology analytics. In Phase I we developed the Sphera platform and validated its utility in measuring organoid response to CFTR rescue. During Phase II we will define the efficiency and sensitivity of the Sphera platform and scale it for high throughput use in a cross-sectional clinical study. A multi-disciplinary, industry-academic partnership with expertise in all areas essential to the successful accomplishment of these aims has been assembled, including investigators with expertise in microfluidics, advanced mathematics, CF lung physiology, and clinical studies. Sphera will be commercialized as a full service platform marketed to clinical and drug development clients. The primary endpoint of this work is to develop a novel tool with dual utility in both CFTR modulator development and precision treatment for individuals with CF. Project Narrative  Individuals with cystic fibrosis face two realities: the extreme diversity in known CFTR mutations and the unpredictable response of CFTR modulator therapies in individual patients. This project expands the development of a comprehensive screening platform to rapidly identify the most promising therapy for individuals with cystic fibrosis.","Human nasal epithelial organoids as a non-invasive, personalized model for predicting effectiveness of CFTR modulators in cystic fibrosis patients",9533194,R44HL130189,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bicarbonates', 'Biological Assay', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Drug Development', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Couples', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epithelial', 'Face', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Morphology', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mucous body substance', 'Mutation', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Nose', 'Organoids', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quality Control', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Sputum', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'Transportation', 'VX-770', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'biobank', 'chronic infection', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical predictors', 'combinatorial', 'commercialization', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional restoration', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'lifestyle factors', 'multidisciplinary', 'mutant', 'novel', 'particle', 'phase 1 testing', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'primary endpoint', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'viscoelasticity']",NHLBI,"PATH BIOANALYTICS, INC.",R44,2018,799989,0.00043006622154101307
"Neurocognitive outcomes and changes in brain and CSF volume after treatment of post-infectious hydrocephalus in Ugandan infants by shunting or ETV/CPC: a randomized prospective trial We estimate 250,000 new infants develop hydrocephalus, most commonly following neonatal infection, in sub- Saharan Africa (SSA) each year. Most have poor access to treatment. We developed and validated a novel operative treatment for infant hydrocephalus combining endoscopic third ventriculostomy and choroid plexus cauterization (ETV/CPC) that avoids shunt dependence in the majority. Our prior collaborative work at CURE Children’s Hospital of Uganda (CCHU) supported equipoise between shunt placement and ETV/CPC in regard to 5-year survival and development. That ETV/CPC prevents shunt dependence among those with no urgent access for shunt malfunction is compelling, but we do not know which treatment optimizes development. We seek to confirm the optimal treatment selection paradigm. Using CT-based measures we found that brain and CSF volume discriminated neurocognitive outcome, providing a promising objective measure of hydrocephalus treatment efficacy. Preliminary data from our R-21 and R01 funded randomized controlled trial (RCT) of ETV/CPC vs. shunt for PIH treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT01936272) have shown no important differences at one year in regard to safety, efficacy, developmental outcome, or brain growth Those achieving normal or near-normal brain volume by 1 year, regardless of preop volume, had the best outcome. The current proposal seeks to accomplish the following aims: 1) test the hypothesis that endoscopic treatment of PIH is better than or equal to shunt placement in regard to five-year neurocognitive development; 2) further develop CCHU as a neuroscience research facility; 3) develop the in-country capacity for sustainable ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI imaging; 4) install optimized ULF-MRI at CCHU; 5) Correlate MRI-derived brain/CSF volume metrics with long-term neurocognitive development following PIH treatment. As planned, the RCT patient study cohort will undergo further developmental assessment using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III) at 24 months post- operatively along with repeat CT-based brain and CSF volume metrics. In the current proposal, developmental assessment will be conducted at 5 years post-treatment using the Vineland-III, as well as an assessment of quality of life. After developing Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) as an ULF-MRI demonstration and resource center, ULF-MRI will be installed at CCHU for evaluation as a volumetric and diagnostic tool compared to CT. Neurocognitive outcome will be correlated with pre- and post-operative MRI- based brain/CSF volumes and treatment modality. Extension of the study will determine whether non-inferiority of ETV/CPC to shunt in regard to developmental outcome and brain growth persists at 5 years post-treatment, whether MRI-based volume metrics effectively supplant CT-based measures, and whether brain and CSF volumetrics prove useful in guiding optimal clinical management. The proposed project will determine whether ETV/CPC is the preferred initial treatment and will further develop research capacity at CCHU. Project Narrative We have established neonatal postinfectious hydrocephalus (PIH) as a major public health problem in East Africa for which there are two strategies of treatment – shunting versus endoscopic third ventriculostomy + choroid plexus cauterization (ETV/CPC), which we developed – with no definitive evidence supporting which therapy is optimal. Our randomized controlled trial of ETV/CPC vs. shunt for PIH has shown no difference in success rate, developmental outcome or brain growth at one year following treatment, with better outcome among those demonstrating “catch-up” brain growth after treatment. We here propose extended follow up of the existing study cohort to analyze early childhood development at 5 years after treatment and to implement new sustainable ultra-low-field MRI technology for brain and CSF volume metrics to provide an evidence- based foundation for better treatment of such children.",Neurocognitive outcomes and changes in brain and CSF volume after treatment of post-infectious hydrocephalus in Ugandan infants by shunting or ETV/CPC: a randomized prospective trial,9553835,R01HD085853,"['7 year old', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Aftercare', 'Age-Months', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cauterize', 'Child', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Environment', 'Equipoise', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Human Resources', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Infection', 'Libraries', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Neonatal', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-of-Life Assessment', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure of choroid plexus', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Uganda', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ventriculostomy', 'Work', 'base', 'brain volume', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'design', 'early childhood', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research facility', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2018,10000,0.016745778670327713
"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user. This unprecedented level of tailoring could revolutionize the way such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.",Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM),9314333,R01MH100482,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Australia', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Employee Assistance Program (Health Care)', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Site', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'base', 'care systems', 'cost', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning progression', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'preference', 'primary care setting', 'psychologic', 'psychopharmacologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'tailored messaging', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment site', 'trial comparing', 'usability', 'web-accessible', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,593935,0.024712075284786156
"Deep learning for representation of codes used for SEER-Medicare claims research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose developing an algorithm and user-friendly software to better identify treatments using Medicare claims data. We will validate our approach using procedures listed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database as a gold standard. In this way, we hope to better match procedures identified using Medicare claims data with SEER listed procedures.  The focus of this research is observational (i.e. non-randomized) data. Well-run randomized clinical trials can provide the best level of evidence of treatment effects. However, randomized trials in the United States have suffered from poor accrual for many interventions. Despite the fact that well-designed randomized clinical trials should be the gold standard, well-designed observational studies might be the only method of obtaining inferences concerning comparative effectiveness for some cancer interventions.  In cancer research, one of the most commonly used databases for observational research is the linked SEER-Medicare database. SEER-Medicare data has provided useful measurements of the effectiveness of a number of cancer therapies. Algorithms for identifying relevant treatment and diagnosis codes using Medicare data are often based on clinical reasoning and scientific evidence. One group of researchers, for example, developed an algorithm for identifying laparoscopic surgery among kidney cancer cases before claims codes for laparoscopic surgery were well developed. While such algorithms are useful for others pursuing similar investigations, there may still be substantial mismatch between treatment identified by the SEER cancer registry and treatment identified through Medicare claims. In this work, we propose developing a rigorous machine learning algorithm that can help researchers in better identifying treatments in Medicare claims data. Specifically, we will design a neural language modeling algorithm and implement a software system that finds vector representations of diagnosis and procedure codes.  We plan on using the neural language modeling algorithm to learn vector representations from SEER- Medicare claims data where related procedure and diagnosis codes are ""neighbors"" (i.e. closely related). We will investigate whether the codes we identify within neighborhoods correspond to the procedure codes used for published SEER-Medicare studies. We will then design a software assistant interface that will allow an investigator to explore which codes are related to a given seed of diagnosis or procedure codes. Finally, we will investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm by comparing procedures identified using Medicare claims with procedures listed in the SEER database. We will replicate analyses from a published SEER-Medicare paper to investigate if estimated treatment effects differ when using our novel algorithm compared to using the algorithm in the published paper. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In cancer research, one of the most commonly used databases for observational research is the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. To improve the identification of procedures when using Medicare claims data, we will design a software assistant interface that will allow an investigator to explore which codes are related to a given seed of diagnosis or procedure codes.

"Machine Learning and Personalized Prognosis for Depression Treatment Abstract Depression treatment is effective for approximately 50-60% of patients who receive treatment, but the probability of a successful response is typically unknown before treatment begins. As a result, depression treatment is routinely delivered in a trial-and-error fashion until a satisfactory response is achieved. Our objective is to provide a personalized prognosis by applying ensemble machine learning techniques to discover novel, non-linear combinations of multiple weak predictors that collectively yield accurate predictions of treatment outcome. This statistical approach considers many prediction variables simultaneously and iteratively constructs a complex prediction model that often dramatically outperforms traditional statistical methods. Aim 1 is to apply stochastic gradient boosted decision trees to predict response to citalopram using archival data from the STAR*D clinical trial. In preliminary analyses, we randomly selected 1223 patients to train the model and another 407 patients to independently test the model (a 75-25 split), with tuning parameters selected by cross-validation to minimize log-loss. The resulting prediction on the independent test sample was superior to the no-information rate (p < 0.001), with an overall predictive accuracy of 66%. Although this level of prediction is significantly better than a no information model, we plan to improve the model's prognostication by 1) adding features that capture the “pharmacological noise” of concurrent (non- study) medication use and 2) updating model predictions based on early signs of response. Aim 2 is to use a similar machine learning approach to examine response to internet-based CBT for depression. Internet-based treatments for depression are growing in popularity, provide efficient access to health care, reduce treatment costs, and have good evidence for treatment efficacy. Importantly, we have a large dataset (N = 1,013) within which to develop treatment-matching algorithms that predict treatment response based on patient attributes. Study Impact: The overarching goal of this project is to use machine learning methods to develop treatment matching algorithms. In the long term, we can envision a system that evaluates a patient on a number of important predictor variables and provides a personalized probability of treatment success. These probabilities would then be used to guide treatment selection or modify current treatment if a poor response is predicted. Developing algorithms that successfully predict whether a particular form of treatment is likely to be successful for a patient with a given set of attributes would be a tremendous step towards efficient and personalized depression treatment.   Public Health Narrative Depression treatment is effective for roughly half of the patients who receive treatment, but it is usually unknown how a specific patient with a particular set of attributes will respond to a given treatment. Our objective is to provide a personalized prognosis by applying ensemble machine learning techniques to discover novel combinations of multiple weak predictors that collectively yield accurate predictions of treatment outcome. Developing algorithms that successfully predict whether a particular form of treatment is likely to be successful for a patient would be a tremendous step towards efficient and personalized depression treatment.  ",Machine Learning and Personalized Prognosis for Depression Treatment,9301041,R21MH110758,"['Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Citalopram', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coin', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data archive', 'effective therapy', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'information model', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive of treatment response', 'psychologic', 'response', 'success', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2017,195625,0.0933145037716555
"Mechanistic Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to combine empirical data with mechanistic physiologic knowledge to produce personalized, quantitative predictions that can lead to improved treatments. In normal practice, physicians reason by analogy from generic physiologic principles, but the technology exists to exploit even imperfect physiologic models make treatment personalized and quantitatively grounded in physiology, and to improve learning from empirical data. We will apply data assimilation (DA), mechanistic mathematical modeling, machine learning, and control theory, which have revolutionized space travel, weather forecasting, transportation and flight, and manufacturing. Data assimilation and control theory have seen very limited use in medicine, usually applied in data-rich circumstances like continuous glucose monitoring or packemakers. Our previous work demonstrated use of data assimilation with glucose-insulin models to predict glucose in the outpatient type 2 diabetes setting. We will extend data assimilation and control theory using, for example, a constrained ensemble Kalman filter and an offline Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, to better handle sparse, short training sets on rapidly changing patients, and we will apply it in the setting of glucose management in the intensive care unit (ICU). Moreover, we will develop DA for phenotyping applications by exploiting the parameter estimation capabilities of DA. Data assimilation can be used to estimate measureable and unmeasureable physiologic states and parameters, and we will use these estimates to create higher definition phenotypes. While we are focusing on glucose management in the ICU, we will develop methods that are likely to generalize, beginning the effort to develop DA in the context of healthcare more broadly. The work we propose is a necessary step toward being able to use mechanism-driven DA to test, validate and optimize personalized short-term treatment strategies, long-term health forecasts, and mechanistic physiologic understanding. We will carry out the following aims: AIM 1—forecast—extend the DA methodology to allow forecasting, personalization, model evaluation, and model selection in the ICU context, relating treatment input to physiologic outcome; AIM 2—phenotype—extend the DA framework to state and parameter estimation to allow for mechanism-based phenotyping, careful uncertainty quantification, and inference of difficult or impossible-to-measure physiology; AIM 3—control—extend the DA to include a controller that begins with desired clinical outcomes, e.g., glucose range, and estimates the inputs, e.g., insulin or nutrition, required to achieve the outcomes. Narrative The goal of this project is to develop better ways to combine data about individual patients with knowledge about physiology to create personalized forecasts and recommendations about a patient's health. We specifically address the management of glucose in the intensive care unit, an area of high importance that could benefit from improved forecasts and recommendations.",Mechanistic Machine Learning,9427058,R01LM012734,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Assimilations', 'Carbohydrates', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Depressed mood', 'Early Intervention', 'Eating', 'Endocrine Physiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fingers', 'Food', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatic', 'Hour', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minor Planets', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Power Plants', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Renal function', 'Running', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'Validity of Results', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'control theory', 'fly', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose production', 'health record', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'insulin secretion', 'interstitial', 'mathematical model', 'nutrition', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized learning', 'personalized medicine', 'physiologic model', 'reduced food intake', 'space travel', 'treatment strategy']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,698661,0.017130419608977005
"Building Multistage Treatment Regimens for Depression after Acute Coronary SyndromeSyndrome Building Multistage Treatment Policy for Depression after Acute Coronary Syndrome Project Summary Depression is not only commonly observed among patients who experienced acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but also has been shown to increase risks for recurrent ACS and mortality. Despite its high prevalence and serious impact, management of post-ACS depression remains poor because of ineciencies in depression screen- ing, limited treatment options of depression after ACS, and lack of e ective procedure if initial treatment fails. To address these issues, clinical researchers have tried to develop personalized stepped care procedures for post-ACS depression patients; this involves o ering patients the choice of receiving psychotherapy and/or antidepressant treatment and adjusting treatment as needed. The treatment decisions are usually based on patient demographics, treatment preference, medical history, progress of disease, and comorbid conditions. With the development of modern technologies, the number of available treatments increases, and more pa- tient information are collected in clinical research. Thus excavating useful information for treatment decisions is becoming more challenging. In this project, we propose to develop a principled way to construct simple interpretable multistage treatment policies from high-dimensional data, that can be used to guide treatment selection throughout the course of the disease. Aim 1 of the project is devoted to the development of vari- able selection methodology for constructing multistage treatment policies using statistical machine learning techniques. The proposed research seeks to incorporate the popular variable selection technique (LASSO) into existing treatment policy search approaches, namely Q-learning and A-Learning, for developing optimal treatment policies and for identifying patient response status to initial treatment { an important factor for tailoring treatment in the subsequent stages. Aim 2 evaluates the proposed methods, applies the methods to post-ACS depression data, and addresses some computational challenges. Statistical research in this area has been focused on the development of evidence-based treatment policies using pre-chosen models and variables; few if any discuss how to select models or variables in a principled way. The proposed work aims to ll this gap in methodology using modern machine learning techniques. Project Narratives The proposed research aims to answer the following question:\How to excavate simple interpretable multistage treatment policies from high-dimensional, longitudinal medical data in a principled way?"" This is a crucial step in the management of chronic disease, such as depression, for which a large number of variables are collected over time, by facilitating the construction of a parsimonious clinical decision system.",Building Multistage Treatment Regimens for Depression after Acute Coronary SyndromeSyndrome,9334312,R21MH108999,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Selection for Treatments', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'individualized medicine', 'mortality', 'preference', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'simulation', 'treatment response']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2017,240000,0.07864559935156366
"Therapeutic Approaches to Dysarthria:  Acoustic and Perceptual Correlates ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 90% of the 1.5 million Americans living with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and 50% of the 500,000 Americans living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) will experience dysarthria. Dysarthria has devastating consequences for life quality and participation in society due to its effects on employment, leisure activities and social relationships. Knowledge of therapy techniques for maximizing perceived speech adequacy, as indexed by the gold standard perceptual construct of intelligibility is thus of vital importance. Owing to the scarcity of impartial comparative studies, the choice of one technique over others is often based on trial and error or reflects clinician bias, both of which are at odds with evidence-based practice. This project has sought to address this critical gap in knowledge regarding the comparative merits of dysarthria treatment techniques since its inception. Toward this end, published studies from the past funding cycle compared the acoustic and perceptual merits of three common, global dysarthria treatment techniques including 1) rate manipulation, 2) an increased vocal intensity and 3) clear speech in MS and PD as well as age and sex matched neurotypical talkers. Global treatment techniques by their very nature elicit co-occurring acoustic changes (e.g., duration, segmental articulation). Because an explanatory, acoustically-based model of intelligibility is lacking, the acoustic change(s) causing or explainin the improved perceptual outcomes of global treatment techniques are unknown. Determining the acoustic variables explaining intelligibility variation in dysarthria would not only tremendousy advance theoretical understanding of intelligibility but also would strengthen the scientific basis for treatment. Treatment focused on those acoustic variables explanatory for improved intelligibility may further accelerate progress in therapy. Importantly, research from the previous funding cycle suggests the promise of speech analysis-resynthesis for identifying segmental and suprasegmental acoustic variables explanatory for intelligibility in dysarthria. Building upon this work, the overarching goal of the continuation is to contribute towards development of an acoustically-based explanatory model of intelligibility. Our approach 1) employs established perceptual procedures and acoustic measures, 2) uses an innovative analysis-resynthesis technique that permits conclusions concerning the explanatory relationship between acoustic changes accompanying dysarthria therapy techniques and intelligibility, and 3) leverages methods from machine learning to build a predictive model of intelligibility from acoustics. The impact of this work is in its contribution to 1) advancing conceptual understanding of intelligibility, 2) strengthening the scientific basis for treatment, and 3) optimizing clinical implementation of dysarthria therapy techniques. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is directly relevant to the mission of NIDCD due to its focus on investigating the therapeutic techniques for maximizing intelligibility in dysarthra secondary to Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis. By advancing conceptual understanding of intelligibility, this research will strengthen the scientific basis for dysarthria treatments and will optimize their clinical implementation.",Therapeutic Approaches to Dysarthria:  Acoustic and Perceptual Correlates,9334170,R01DC004689,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Articulation', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Study', 'Development', 'Dysarthria', 'Employment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Idiopathic Parkinson Disease', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Leisure Activities', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clear speech', 'comparative', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment program']",NIDCD,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2017,517281,-0.0014407719690646195
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs.

"Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) white matter is an emerging new treatment strategy for treatment resistant depression (TRD) with published studies demonstrating sustained long-term antidepressant effects in 40-60% of implanted patients. Converging evidence from positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion tractography (DTI) strongly suggests that DBS mediates its clinical benefits by direct modulation of the SCC--a key hub in an aberrant neural circuit. Despite encouraging sustained long-term effects in this notoriously difficult to treat patient population, randomized controls trials of SCC DBS and other DBS targets for TRD are now on hold as initial results failed to meet predefined clinical endpoints. While this proposal cannot address those failures directly, a clear necessary next step for effective future testing and eventual dissemination of this treatment is the need to develop brain-based biomarkers to guide lead placement and to titrate stimulation parameters during ongoing care. In the absence of such biomarkers to guide DBS use, there will continue to be variability in the implementation of clinical procedures during testing, leading to ambiguous and possibly misleading trial outcomes, and subsequent abandonment of a potentially useful treatment. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop and test objective methods for reliable device configuration in individuals by optimizing DBS-SCC treatment with respect to human functional anatomy and key electrophysiological variables. We will leverage the capabilities of a novel bi-directional neuromodulation system (Medtronic RC+S) that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation to define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery. Ongoing measurements of SCC local field potentials (LFPs) will be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potential studies (ERP) performed as part of an experimental clinical trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS for TRD to identify an oscillatory signal that (1) is sensitive to changes in frequency and current parameters at the tractography defined optimal target and (2) tracks with depression state over time. Connectome-based and machine learning approaches will be used to define the most robust network biomarker and its response characteristics. Once defined, the control policy will be tested in a second phase feasibility study where parameters for initial stimulation will be selected based on the depression brain state biomarker and adjustments made to correct drift from the predefined target signal. If successful, the data- driven model and control strategy will enable objective, rational clinical programming of DBS stimulation for depression and provide a new model and approach for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment. . NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to refine and optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter for patients with treatment resistant depression. Using a newly available bi- directional neuromodulation system that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation, this study will define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery providing a new evidence-based strategy for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment.",Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression,9405277,UH3NS103550,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffusion', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Failure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Resistance', 'Scalp structure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'antidepressant effect', 'base', 'connectome', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'implantation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open label', 'patient population', 'response', 'support tools', 'targeted biomarker', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'white matter']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,UH3,2017,5562,0.03417873687856515
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for Chagas disease Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Project Summary:  Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these chal- lenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymor- phisms, whole brain neuroimaging, bioﬂuids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mecha- nisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Speciﬁcally, in Aim 1, we develop efﬁcient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation mod- els to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efﬁciency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-speciﬁc substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic sys- tems through ordinary differential equations with random inﬂections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker proﬁles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efﬁcient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individu- alized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest beneﬁt from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art ana- lytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research com- munity. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9308279,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,366940,0.014943574549438543
"Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response PROJECT SUMMARY The growing expansion of the approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and the variable responses to MS treatment have created an unmet medical need to provide individually tailored therapy. Efforts to bring precision medicine to provide individualized MS treatment selection have been impeded by our limited understanding of the factors that determine treatment response. While genomics hold the promise for closing this knowledge gap, the insufficient number of patients with detailed treatment response data and the modest effect size of genetic variants that influence treatment responses are the main limiting factors in pharmacogenomics studies. As electronic health records (EHR) become widely adopted and increasingly standardized and as we implement sophisticated computational and statistical methods to harness the EHR data, EHR systems can become cost-effective platforms to perform large-scale treatment response studies in real-life settings. Our team with a history of productive collaborations and diverse expertise (led by PI Dr. Xia) previously developed robust algorithms to identify 5,495 MS patients from the Partners HealthCare EHR systems and then model MS disease activity in these patients using EHR data. The Partners EHR system contains longitudinal clinical information on thousands of MS patients from two large academic medical centers and is linked to a well-characterized MS patient research registry and biobanks with existing genomics data. For the proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that meaningful phenotypes of MS disease activity can be extracted from EHR data to inform treatment response, and that additional common genetic variants exist in the population and can predict therapeutic response in MS when combined with clinical features derived from EHR data. The proposed study has three aims with the overall goal to produce a computational and analytic approach capable of identifying MS disease activity in relation to treatment history using EHR data and integrate with genomics profile to develop a predictive model of therapeutic response to commonly prescribed DMTs in this cohort of 5,495 MS patients, including injectable (interferon-β, glatiramer acetate) and oral (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) options. Specifically, we will (1) leverage narrative electronic health records data (e.g., clinical notes, radiology reports) and natural language processing (NLP) to ascertain individualized response to DMTs (n=600 for each DMT); (2) Identify clinical features from electronic health record data (e.g., diagnoses, exposures) that predict response to DMTs using a systematic phenome-wide approach; (3) Develop and test a comprehensive predictive model of individualized response to DMTs that incorporates clinical and genetic predictors. This research has the potential impact to be transformative by contributing to a major knowledge gap regarding the factors that influence treatment response and bringing precision medicine closer to individualized MS treatment selection. PROJECT NARRATIVE AND PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition that affects over 400,000 individuals in the United States and creates a high socioeconomic burden as a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Because not all patients respond the same way to a specific medication, physicians and MS patients often lose precious time searching for effective treatment with serially testing of costly medications. An individually tailored treatment can ensure early start of effective medication that can prevent relapse and progression of disability. Ultimately, this project will help gain insights into the factors that determine treatment response and enable physicians to match an individual MS patient's clinical and genomic profile with uniquely tailored therapy to maximize effectiveness, delay disease progression and reduce overall cost.",Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response,9358350,R01NS098023,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Fumarates', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injectable', 'Interferon-beta', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'copolymer 1', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'phenome', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,344715,0.04333817380195944
"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particular, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,8996183,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'burden of illness', 'candidate marker', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'flexibility', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient population', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2017,323753,-0.010390035772860826
"Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of high throughput biological data. Effective methods for analyzing this data must balance two opposing ideals. They must be (a) flexible and sufficiently data-adaptive to deal with the data's complex structure, yet (b) sufficiently simpe and transparent to interpret their results and analyze their uncertainty (so as not to mislead with conviction). This is additionally challenging because these datasets are massive, so attacking these problems requires a marriage of statistical and computational ideas. This project develops frameworks for attacking several problems involving this biological data. These frameworks balance flexibility and simplicity and are computationally tractable even on massive datasets. This application has three specific aims. Aim 1: A flexible and computationally tractable framework for building predictive models. Commonly we are interested in modelling phenotypic traits of an individual using omics data. We would like to find a small subset of genetic features which are important in phenotype expression level. In this approach, I propose a method for flexibly modelling a response variable (e.g. phenotype) with a small, adaptively chosen subset of features, in a computationally scalable fashion. Aim 2: A framework for jointly identifying and testing regions which differ across conditions. For example, in the context of methylation data measured in normal and cancer tissue samples, one might expect that some regions are more methylated in one tissue type or the other. These regions might suggest targets for therapy. However, we do not have the background biological knowledge to pre-specify regions to test. I propose an approach which adaptively selects regions and then tests them in a principled way. This approach is based on a convex formulation to the problem, using shrinkage to achieve sparse differences. Aim 3: A principled framework for developing and evaluating predictive biomarkers during clinical trials. Modern treatments target specific genetic abnormalities that are generally present in only a subset of patients with a disease. A major current goal in medicine is to develop biomarkers that identify those patients likely to benefit from treatment. I propose a framework for developing and testing biomarkers during large-scale clinical trials. This framework simultaneously builds these biomarkers and applies them to restrict enrollment into the trial to only those likely to benefit from treatment. The statistical tools that result from th proposed research will be implemented in freely available software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent advances in high-throughput biotechnology have provided us with a wealth of new biological data, a large step towards unlocking the tantalizing promise of personalized medicine: the tailoring of treatment to the genetic makeup of each individual and disease. However, classical statistical and computational tools have proven unable to exploit the extensive information these new experimental technologies bring to bear. This project focuses on building new flexible, data-adaptive tools to translate this wealth of low level information into actionable discoveries, and actual biological understanding.",Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics,9349367,DP5OD019820,"['Address', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Formulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Polynomial Models', 'Population', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telomerase', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'convict', 'data to knowledge', 'flexibility', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic signature', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput analysis', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP5,2017,326784,0.01813965681872481
"Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program “Optimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasis”constitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC “Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis” will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities OVERVIEW NARRATIVE Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment.

"Predicting Internet-Based Treatment Response for Major Depressive Disorder As many as 53% of students report experiencing depression during college, and these depressive episodes are associated with a higher frequency of academic problems, comorbidity, and suicide. Although there are effective options for treatment, the majority of individuals (>70%) do not pursue services, and even for those who do, response rates remain modest (~40-50%). As a means of increasing accessibility to treatment, internet-based interventions for depression have been developed and tested. Despite increased availability, response to internet-based interventions continues to vary substantially, and failed treatment often contributes to persistence and worsening of symptoms. Therefore, identifying individuals with a high likelihood of responding to internet-based treatment would represent a major advance and address a critical unmet need.  In recent years, promising approaches for testing the heterogeneity of the treatment effects – delineating which individuals are likely to respond to a given treatment – have been developed. However, their use for identifying predictors of treatment response in depression remains unclear. To address this unmet need, the proposed study will test a new, cost-effective, and feasibly-scaled method of predicting differential treatment response following internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression in a large, representative college sample (Boston Consortium of Colleges and Universities which includes 7 schools). Members of the consortium have committed to screening all incoming freshmen (N = ~14,000) through a rigorous online assessment and to offer iCBT to students with elevated levels of depressive symptoms (i.e., minor or major depression). The following steps will be pursued. First, in the initial phase of the study, freshmen students from the Boston Consortium will be screened for depression through an online survey, and they also will complete web-based neurocognitive tasks probing key mechanisms underpinning depression. Depressed students will be invited to enroll in iCBT, and a predictive algorithm will be developed based on assessments across different units of analysis (i.e., clinical characteristics, neurocognitive indices) to identify iCBT responders. Second, after the development phase, an independent sample of college students will be recruited to validate the predictive algorithm. This validation phase will use clinical indicators and neurocognitive data. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data targeting key mechanisms within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) will be acquired from a subset of participants. Neural data will be integrated to determine whether they improve the predictive algorithm. Third, data across independent samples will be combined, which will increase power to refine our predictive model for both acute and sustained response. In summary, there are alarming rates of depression among college students, and only a minority of students utilize mental health services. The proposed research will personalize our approach to depression treatment, which, ultimately, will improve effectiveness and better inform mental health care across college campuses. Depression is common, recurrent, and debilitating among college students, and the majority of depressed individuals (>70%) do not pursue treatment. Internet-based interventions are effective, low-cost, and easily disseminated, and the goal of this project is to test a new, cost-effective, and feasibly-scaled method of predicting differential treatment response to an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression. This innovative approach - which relies on an integration of data across units of analysis (e.g., self- report, neurocognitive, and neural data) – promises to optimize treatment outcomes for depression, and therefore, reduce associated negative consequences including academic problems, risky behavior engagement, and suicidality.",Predicting Internet-Based Treatment Response for Major Depressive Disorder,9328159,R56MH109566,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Boston', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Policy Maker', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Students', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'college', 'control trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'minor depressive disorder', 'minority student', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuromechanism', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive of treatment response', 'programs', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'reward expectancy', 'screening', 'suicidal behavior', 'support tools', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R56,2017,139359,0.03824346625634537
"Software Platform to Stratify Patients for Treatment Arm Randomization in Human Clinical Trials using Patient-Level Predictive Models ABSTRACT Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of brain and spinal cord motor neurons. Since Riluzole was approved in 1995, over 30 late-phase clinical trials have failed and no additional medications have been approved for ALS. While death from ALS averages 3 to 5 years from onset of symptoms, disease progression displays wide heterogeneity. A typical year-long clinical trial can have 20 to 25% of the patients die from the disease while another similar percentage progresses very slowly if at all. Several meta-analyses of ALS trial data indicate that ALS clinical trials are prone to statistical uncertainty and would benefit from tools that increase statistical sensitivity. It is clear that current statistical tools are inadequate to address the drug development challenges posed by this disease and many other diseases that characteristically exhibit high heterogeneity in disease progression. Using the recently available ALS PRO-ACT data set, our team was recently declared a winner of the DREAM Phil Bowen ALS Prediction Prize4Life Challenge. Since the contest, we have significantly improved the algorithm, built several additional models and begun to create drug development tools. The goal of this grant is to validate our clinical trial randomization tool and develop a prototype interface for use and testing at clinical trial sites. This prototype will serve as a platform for building a suite of tools based on disease progression predictions of individual patients that will eventually be used for drug development in multiple indications. The key innovation of this work, as it applies to randomizing patients for inclusion in different arms of a clinical trial is that it stratifies patients not by a set of features at the beginning of a trial, but rather by predicted outcome at the end of the trial as if patients in the treatment arm had not received the intervention being tested. An improved trial arm balance will provide a better test of the efficacy of the intervention. This work will focus on the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Demonstrate that, compared to traditional randomization strata, randomization strata defined by predictive algorithms significantly improve the balance of outcome features at the end of a trial period. Aim 2: Work with our clinical partner to develop a prototype platform that will enable an ALS predictive algorithm to be used by on-site investigators for randomization in future clinical trials. The randomization tool is the first in a series of planned tools based on patient level disease progression predictions. These tools will radically change the way early ALS clinical trials are enrolled, simulated and analyzed and will enable the development of similar tools, not only for other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, but also for multiple other diseases including diabetes, hospital-acquired infections, heart disease and cancer.

"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Outcomes from this study will inform clinical guidelines for effective language treatment in PPA, which can be adapted for other dementia syndromes.",Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia,9449181,R01AG055425,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Aphasia', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Videoconferences', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'eHealth', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'implementation research', 'language impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized care', 'premature', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'restoration', 'skills', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment response', 'trial design', 'web app']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,663165,0.04350214613214514
"Human nasal epithelial organoids as a non-invasive, personalized model for predicting effectiveness of CFTR modulators in cystic fibrosis patients Project Summary  The discovery of the single gene (CFTR) responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF) has been transformational in focusing treatment efforts on the development and approval of drugs that restore the function of the CFTR protein. Excellent clinical response for CF patients with “gating” mutations is observed following treatment with the CFTR modulator drug ivacaftor (VX-770); however, for the remaining ~95% of patients, no effective treatments exist. More than two thousand different CFTR mutations, combined with other genetic and environmental factors, result in significant variability in response among individuals to a single therapy. To improve the clinical outcome for all CF patients, it is important that patient-specific in vivo features of CF are faithfully reproduced in vitro for predictive screening assays. To meet that need we have developed a novel organoid-based screening platform, Sphera™, using cells derived from a patient’s nasal epithelia. Sphera couples patient-specific organoids with an integrated assessment of CFTR function, including organoid morphology and viscoelastic characterization of luminal mucus using our proprietary microrheology analytics. In Phase I we developed the Sphera platform and validated its utility in measuring organoid response to CFTR rescue. During Phase II we will define the efficiency and sensitivity of the Sphera platform and scale it for high throughput use in a cross-sectional clinical study. A multi-disciplinary, industry-academic partnership with expertise in all areas essential to the successful accomplishment of these aims has been assembled, including investigators with expertise in microfluidics, advanced mathematics, CF lung physiology, and clinical studies. Sphera will be commercialized as a full service platform marketed to clinical and drug development clients. The primary endpoint of this work is to develop a novel tool with dual utility in both CFTR modulator development and precision treatment for individuals with CF. Project Narrative  Individuals with cystic fibrosis face two realities: the extreme diversity in known CFTR mutations and the unpredictable response of CFTR modulator therapies in individual patients. This project expands the development of a comprehensive screening platform to rapidly identify the most promising therapy for individuals with cystic fibrosis.","Human nasal epithelial organoids as a non-invasive, personalized model for predicting effectiveness of CFTR modulators in cystic fibrosis patients",9385159,R44HL130189,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bicarbonates', 'Biological Assay', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Drug Development', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Couples', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epithelial', 'Face', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Morphology', 'Mucous body substance', 'Mutation', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Nose', 'Organoids', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quality Control', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Sputum', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'Transportation', 'VX-770', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical predictors', 'combinatorial', 'commercialization', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional restoration', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'lifestyle factors', 'multidisciplinary', 'mutant', 'novel', 'particle', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'viscoelasticity']",NHLBI,"PATH BIOANALYTICS, INC.",R44,2017,799995,0.00043006622154101307
"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user. This unprecedented level of tailoring could revolutionize the way such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.",Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM),9109063,R01MH100482,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Australia', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Employee Assistance Program (Health Care)', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Site', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'base', 'care systems', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'motivational intervention', 'preference', 'primary care setting', 'psychologic', 'psychopharmacologic', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'tailored messaging', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment site', 'trial comparing', 'usability', 'web-accessible', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,580914,0.024712075284786156
"Deep learning for representation of codes used for SEER-Medicare claims research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose developing an algorithm and user-friendly software to better identify treatments using Medicare claims data. We will validate our approach using procedures listed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database as a gold standard. In this way, we hope to better match procedures identified using Medicare claims data with SEER listed procedures.  The focus of this research is observational (i.e. non-randomized) data. Well-run randomized clinical trials can provide the best level of evidence of treatment effects. However, randomized trials in the United States have suffered from poor accrual for many interventions. Despite the fact that well-designed randomized clinical trials should be the gold standard, well-designed observational studies might be the only method of obtaining inferences concerning comparative effectiveness for some cancer interventions.  In cancer research, one of the most commonly used databases for observational research is the linked SEER-Medicare database. SEER-Medicare data has provided useful measurements of the effectiveness of a number of cancer therapies. Algorithms for identifying relevant treatment and diagnosis codes using Medicare data are often based on clinical reasoning and scientific evidence. One group of researchers, for example, developed an algorithm for identifying laparoscopic surgery among kidney cancer cases before claims codes for laparoscopic surgery were well developed. While such algorithms are useful for others pursuing similar investigations, there may still be substantial mismatch between treatment identified by the SEER cancer registry and treatment identified through Medicare claims. In this work, we propose developing a rigorous machine learning algorithm that can help researchers in better identifying treatments in Medicare claims data. Specifically, we will design a neural language modeling algorithm and implement a software system that finds vector representations of diagnosis and procedure codes.  We plan on using the neural language modeling algorithm to learn vector representations from SEER- Medicare claims data where related procedure and diagnosis codes are ""neighbors"" (i.e. closely related). We will investigate whether the codes we identify within neighborhoods correspond to the procedure codes used for published SEER-Medicare studies. We will then design a software assistant interface that will allow an investigator to explore which codes are related to a given seed of diagnosis or procedure codes. Finally, we will investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm by comparing procedures identified using Medicare claims with procedures listed in the SEER database. We will replicate analyses from a published SEER-Medicare paper to investigate if estimated treatment effects differ when using our novel algorithm compared to using the algorithm in the published paper.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In cancer research, one of the most commonly used databases for observational research is the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. To improve the identification of procedures when using Medicare claims data, we will design a software assistant interface that will allow an investigator to explore which codes are related to a given seed of diagnosis or procedure codes. This should improve the identification of procedures when using Medicare claims data, and make conclusions drawn from analyses using the database more reliable and consistent.            ",Deep learning for representation of codes used for SEER-Medicare claims research,9023921,R21CA202130,"['Algorithms', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Ethical Issues', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Laparoscopic Surgical Procedures', 'Learning', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Study', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Update', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplasm registry', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'relating to nervous system', 'software systems', 'treatment effect', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'vector', 'volunteer']",NCI,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R21,2016,178072,-0.0008496832551656394
"Machine Learning and Personalized Prognosis for Depression Treatment Abstract Depression treatment is effective for approximately 50-60% of patients who receive treatment, but the probability of a successful response is typically unknown before treatment begins. As a result, depression treatment is routinely delivered in a trial-and-error fashion until a satisfactory response is achieved. Our objective is to provide a personalized prognosis by applying ensemble machine learning techniques to discover novel, non-linear combinations of multiple weak predictors that collectively yield accurate predictions of treatment outcome. This statistical approach considers many prediction variables simultaneously and iteratively constructs a complex prediction model that often dramatically outperforms traditional statistical methods. Aim 1 is to apply stochastic gradient boosted decision trees to predict response to citalopram using archival data from the STAR*D clinical trial. In preliminary analyses, we randomly selected 1223 patients to train the model and another 407 patients to independently test the model (a 75-25 split), with tuning parameters selected by cross-validation to minimize log-loss. The resulting prediction on the independent test sample was superior to the no-information rate (p < 0.001), with an overall predictive accuracy of 66%. Although this level of prediction is significantly better than a no information model, we plan to improve the model's prognostication by 1) adding features that capture the “pharmacological noise” of concurrent (non- study) medication use and 2) updating model predictions based on early signs of response. Aim 2 is to use a similar machine learning approach to examine response to internet-based CBT for depression. Internet-based treatments for depression are growing in popularity, provide efficient access to health care, reduce treatment costs, and have good evidence for treatment efficacy. Importantly, we have a large dataset (N = 1,013) within which to develop treatment-matching algorithms that predict treatment response based on patient attributes. Study Impact: The overarching goal of this project is to use machine learning methods to develop treatment matching algorithms. In the long term, we can envision a system that evaluates a patient on a number of important predictor variables and provides a personalized probability of treatment success. These probabilities would then be used to guide treatment selection or modify current treatment if a poor response is predicted. Developing algorithms that successfully predict whether a particular form of treatment is likely to be successful for a patient with a given set of attributes would be a tremendous step towards efficient and personalized depression treatment.   Public Health Narrative Depression treatment is effective for roughly half of the patients who receive treatment, but it is usually unknown how a specific patient with a particular set of attributes will respond to a given treatment. Our objective is to provide a personalized prognosis by applying ensemble machine learning techniques to discover novel combinations of multiple weak predictors that collectively yield accurate predictions of treatment outcome. Developing algorithms that successfully predict whether a particular form of treatment is likely to be successful for a patient would be a tremendous step towards efficient and personalized depression treatment.  ",Machine Learning and Personalized Prognosis for Depression Treatment,9168157,R21MH110758,"['Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'Citalopram', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coin', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'effective therapy', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'information model', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'psychologic', 'response', 'success', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2016,234375,0.0933145037716555
"Building Multistage Treatment Regimens for Depression after Acute Coronary SyndromeSyndrome Building Multistage Treatment Policy for Depression after Acute Coronary Syndrome Project Summary Depression is not only commonly observed among patients who experienced acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but also has been shown to increase risks for recurrent ACS and mortality. Despite its high prevalence and serious impact, management of post-ACS depression remains poor because of ineciencies in depression screen- ing, limited treatment options of depression after ACS, and lack of e ective procedure if initial treatment fails. To address these issues, clinical researchers have tried to develop personalized stepped care procedures for post-ACS depression patients; this involves o ering patients the choice of receiving psychotherapy and/or antidepressant treatment and adjusting treatment as needed. The treatment decisions are usually based on patient demographics, treatment preference, medical history, progress of disease, and comorbid conditions. With the development of modern technologies, the number of available treatments increases, and more pa- tient information are collected in clinical research. Thus excavating useful information for treatment decisions is becoming more challenging. In this project, we propose to develop a principled way to construct simple interpretable multistage treatment policies from high-dimensional data, that can be used to guide treatment selection throughout the course of the disease. Aim 1 of the project is devoted to the development of vari- able selection methodology for constructing multistage treatment policies using statistical machine learning techniques. The proposed research seeks to incorporate the popular variable selection technique (LASSO) into existing treatment policy search approaches, namely Q-learning and A-Learning, for developing optimal treatment policies and for identifying patient response status to initial treatment { an important factor for tailoring treatment in the subsequent stages. Aim 2 evaluates the proposed methods, applies the methods to post-ACS depression data, and addresses some computational challenges. Statistical research in this area has been focused on the development of evidence-based treatment policies using pre-chosen models and variables; few if any discuss how to select models or variables in a principled way. The proposed work aims to ll this gap in methodology using modern machine learning techniques. Project Narratives The proposed research aims to answer the following question:\How to excavate simple interpretable multistage treatment policies from high-dimensional, longitudinal medical data in a principled way?""

"Therapeutic Approaches to Dysarthria:  Acoustic and Perceptual Correlates ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 90% of the 1.5 million Americans living with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and 50% of the 500,000 Americans living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) will experience dysarthria. Dysarthria has devastating consequences for life quality and participation in society due to its effects on employment, leisure activities and social relationships. Knowledge of therapy techniques for maximizing perceived speech adequacy, as indexed by the gold standard perceptual construct of intelligibility is thus of vital importance. Owing to the scarcity of impartial comparative studies, the choice of one technique over others is often based on trial and error or reflects clinician bias, both of which are at odds with evidence-based practice. This project has sought to address this critical gap in knowledge regarding the comparative merits of dysarthria treatment techniques since its inception. Toward this end, published studies from the past funding cycle compared the acoustic and perceptual merits of three common, global dysarthria treatment techniques including 1) rate manipulation, 2) an increased vocal intensity and 3) clear speech in MS and PD as well as age and sex matched neurotypical talkers. Global treatment techniques by their very nature elicit co-occurring acoustic changes (e.g., duration, segmental articulation). Because an explanatory, acoustically-based model of intelligibility is lacking, the acoustic change(s) causing or explainin the improved perceptual outcomes of global treatment techniques are unknown. Determining the acoustic variables explaining intelligibility variation in dysarthria would not only tremendousy advance theoretical understanding of intelligibility but also would strengthen the scientific basis for treatment. Treatment focused on those acoustic variables explanatory for improved intelligibility may further accelerate progress in therapy. Importantly, research from the previous funding cycle suggests the promise of speech analysis-resynthesis for identifying segmental and suprasegmental acoustic variables explanatory for intelligibility in dysarthria. Building upon this work, the overarching goal of the continuation is to contribute towards development of an acoustically-based explanatory model of intelligibility. Our approach 1) employs established perceptual procedures and acoustic measures, 2) uses an innovative analysis-resynthesis technique that permits conclusions concerning the explanatory relationship between acoustic changes accompanying dysarthria therapy techniques and intelligibility, and 3) leverages methods from machine learning to build a predictive model of intelligibility from acoustics. The impact of this work is in its contribution to 1) advancing conceptual understanding of intelligibility, 2) strengthening the scientific basis for treatment, and 3) optimizing clinical implementation of dysarthria therapy techniques. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is directly relevant to the mission of NIDCD due to its focus on investigating the therapeutic techniques for maximizing intelligibility in dysarthra secondary to Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis. By advancing conceptual understanding of intelligibility, this research will strengthen the scientific basis for dysarthria treatments and will optimize their clinical implementation.",Therapeutic Approaches to Dysarthria:  Acoustic and Perceptual Correlates,9120824,R01DC004689,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Study', 'Development', 'Dysarthria', 'Employment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Idiopathic Parkinson Disease', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Leisure Activities', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clear speech', 'comparative', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'predictive modeling', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment program']",NIDCD,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2016,504687,-0.0014407719690646195
"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,9119612,R01MH103148,"['Accelerometer', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical complication', 'mood symptom', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychotic symptoms', 'relapse patients', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2016,388305,0.011819934513809124
"Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response PROJECT SUMMARY The growing expansion of the approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and the variable responses to MS treatment have created an unmet medical need to provide individually tailored therapy. Efforts to bring precision medicine to provide individualized MS treatment selection have been impeded by our limited understanding of the factors that determine treatment response. While genomics hold the promise for closing this knowledge gap, the insufficient number of patients with detailed treatment response data and the modest effect size of genetic variants that influence treatment responses are the main limiting factors in pharmacogenomics studies. As electronic health records (EHR) become widely adopted and increasingly standardized and as we implement sophisticated computational and statistical methods to harness the EHR data, EHR systems can become cost-effective platforms to perform large-scale treatment response studies in real-life settings. Our team with a history of productive collaborations and diverse expertise (led by PI Dr. Xia) previously developed robust algorithms to identify 5,495 MS patients from the Partners HealthCare EHR systems and then model MS disease activity in these patients using EHR data. The Partners EHR system contains longitudinal clinical information on thousands of MS patients from two large academic medical centers and is linked to a well-characterized MS patient research registry and biobanks with existing genomics data. For the proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that meaningful phenotypes of MS disease activity can be extracted from EHR data to inform treatment response, and that additional common genetic variants exist in the population and can predict therapeutic response in MS when combined with clinical features derived from EHR data. The proposed study has three aims with the overall goal to produce a computational and analytic approach capable of identifying MS disease activity in relation to treatment history using EHR data and integrate with genomics profile to develop a predictive model of therapeutic response to commonly prescribed DMTs in this cohort of 5,495 MS patients, including injectable (interferon-β, glatiramer acetate) and oral (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) options. Specifically, we will (1) leverage narrative electronic health records data (e.g., clinical notes, radiology reports) and natural language processing (NLP) to ascertain individualized response to DMTs (n=600 for each DMT); (2) Identify clinical features from electronic health record data (e.g., diagnoses, exposures) that predict response to DMTs using a systematic phenome-wide approach; (3) Develop and test a comprehensive predictive model of individualized response to DMTs that incorporates clinical and genetic predictors. This research has the potential impact to be transformative by contributing to a major knowledge gap regarding the factors that influence treatment response and bringing precision medicine closer to individualized MS treatment selection. PROJECT NARRATIVE AND PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition that affects over 400,000 individuals in the United States and creates a high socioeconomic burden as a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Because not all patients respond the same way to a specific medication, physicians and MS patients often lose precious time searching for effective treatment with serially testing of costly medications. An individually tailored treatment can ensure early start of effective medication that can prevent relapse and progression of disability. Ultimately, this project will help gain insights into the factors that determine treatment response and enable physicians to match an individual MS patient's clinical and genomic profile with uniquely tailored therapy to maximize effectiveness, delay disease progression and reduce overall cost.",Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response,9158403,R01NS098023,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Fumarates', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injectable', 'Interferon-beta', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'copolymer 1', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'phenome', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,370421,0.04333817380195944
"Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of high throughput biological data. Effective methods for analyzing this data must balance two opposing ideals. They must be (a) flexible and sufficiently data-adaptive to deal with the data's complex structure, yet (b) sufficiently simpe and transparent to interpret their results and analyze their uncertainty (so as not to mislead with conviction). This is additionally challenging because these datasets are massive, so attacking these problems requires a marriage of statistical and computational ideas. This project develops frameworks for attacking several problems involving this biological data. These frameworks balance flexibility and simplicity and are computationally tractable even on massive datasets. This application has three specific aims. Aim 1: A flexible and computationally tractable framework for building predictive models. Commonly we are interested in modelling phenotypic traits of an individual using omics data. We would like to find a small subset of genetic features which are important in phenotype expression level. In this approach, I propose a method for flexibly modelling a response variable (e.g. phenotype) with a small, adaptively chosen subset of features, in a computationally scalable fashion. Aim 2: A framework for jointly identifying and testing regions which differ across conditions. For example, in the context of methylation data measured in normal and cancer tissue samples, one might expect that some regions are more methylated in one tissue type or the other. These regions might suggest targets for therapy. However, we do not have the background biological knowledge to pre-specify regions to test. I propose an approach which adaptively selects regions and then tests them in a principled way. This approach is based on a convex formulation to the problem, using shrinkage to achieve sparse differences. Aim 3: A principled framework for developing and evaluating predictive biomarkers during clinical trials. Modern treatments target specific genetic abnormalities that are generally present in only a subset of patients with a disease. A major current goal in medicine is to develop biomarkers that identify those patients likely to benefit from treatment. I propose a framework for developing and testing biomarkers during large-scale clinical trials. This framework simultaneously builds these biomarkers and applies them to restrict enrollment into the trial to only those likely to benefit from treatment. The statistical tools that result from th proposed research will be implemented in freely available software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent advances in high-throughput biotechnology have provided us with a wealth of new biological data, a large step towards unlocking the tantalizing promise of personalized medicine: the tailoring of treatment to the genetic makeup of each individual and disease. However, classical statistical and computational tools have proven unable to exploit the extensive information these new experimental technologies bring to bear. This project focuses on building new flexible, data-adaptive tools to translate this wealth of low level information into actionable discoveries, and actual biological understanding.",Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics,9135552,DP5OD019820,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Formulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Polynomial Models', 'Population', 'Proteomics', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telomerase', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data to knowledge', 'flexibility', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic signature', 'high throughput analysis', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP5,2016,324169,0.01813965681872481
"Predicting Internet-Based Treatment Response for Major Depressive Disorder As many as 53% of students report experiencing depression during college, and these depressive episodes are associated with a higher frequency of academic problems, comorbidity, and suicide. Although there are effective options for treatment, the majority of individuals (>70%) do not pursue services, and even for those who do, response rates remain modest (~40-50%). As a means of increasing accessibility to treatment, internet-based interventions for depression have been developed and tested. Despite increased availability, response to internet-based interventions continues to vary substantially, and failed treatment often contributes to persistence and worsening of symptoms. Therefore, identifying individuals with a high likelihood of responding to internet-based treatment would represent a major advance and address a critical unmet need.  In recent years, promising approaches for testing the heterogeneity of the treatment effects – delineating which individuals are likely to respond to a given treatment – have been developed. However, their use for identifying predictors of treatment response in depression remains unclear. To address this unmet need, the proposed study will test a new, cost-effective, and feasibly-scaled method of predicting differential treatment response following internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression in a large, representative college sample (Boston Consortium of Colleges and Universities which includes 7 schools). Members of the consortium have committed to screening all incoming freshmen (N = ~14,000) through a rigorous online assessment and to offer iCBT to students with elevated levels of depressive symptoms (i.e., minor or major depression). The following steps will be pursued. First, in the initial phase of the study, freshmen students from the Boston Consortium will be screened for depression through an online survey, and they also will complete web-based neurocognitive tasks probing key mechanisms underpinning depression. Depressed students will be invited to enroll in iCBT, and a predictive algorithm will be developed based on assessments across different units of analysis (i.e., clinical characteristics, neurocognitive indices) to identify iCBT responders. Second, after the development phase, an independent sample of college students will be recruited to validate the predictive algorithm. This validation phase will use clinical indicators and neurocognitive data. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data targeting key mechanisms within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) will be acquired from a subset of participants. Neural data will be integrated to determine whether they improve the predictive algorithm. Third, data across independent samples will be combined, which will increase power to refine our predictive model for both acute and sustained response. In summary, there are alarming rates of depression among college students, and only a minority of students utilize mental health services. The proposed research will personalize our approach to depression treatment, which, ultimately, will improve effectiveness and better inform mental health care across college campuses. Depression is common, recurrent, and debilitating among college students, and the majority of depressed individuals (>70%) do not pursue treatment. Internet-based interventions are effective, low-cost, and easily disseminated, and the goal of this project is to test a new, cost-effective, and feasibly-scaled method of predicting differential treatment response to an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression. This innovative approach - which relies on an integration of data across units of analysis (e.g., self- report, neurocognitive, and neural data) – promises to optimize treatment outcomes for depression, and therefore, reduce associated negative consequences including academic problems, risky behavior engagement, and suicidality.",Predicting Internet-Based Treatment Response for Major Depressive Disorder,9314157,R56MH109566,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Boston', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Policy Maker', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Students', 'Suicide', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'college', 'control trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'minor depressive disorder', 'minority student', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuromechanism', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'reward expectancy', 'screening', 'suicidal', 'support tools', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R56,2016,364740,0.03824346625634537
"Naltrexone Treatment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this international pilot study we use data from four clinical trials of heroin dependence treatment to identify which patients will be better respondents to naltrexone treatment and among respondents which type of naltrexone formulation (oral, implantable, or injectable) leads to the best outcome. Although in the United States naltrexone has been FDA approved for treatment of opioid addiction it has been underutilized. In Russia (where substitution therapy is illegal), naltrexone is the only pharmacological treatment option. Naltrexone is available in three forms: oral and extended release, injectable, and implantable depot-formulations. A novel methodology (Model-based Random Forest, mobForest) (Garge et al. 2013) will be extended to heroin treatment and to the development of a single interpretable parsimonious model. These methods will be applied to combined data from past four naltrexone efficacy randomized double blind, double dummy, placebo- controlled clinical trials and identify which patients are likely to respond to different naltrexone formulations. These studies were conducted in St. Petersburg, Russia, have data on almost 1,000 patients with more than 400 individual-level variables spanning demographics, clinical, genetic, and psychometrics domains. We will develop validated predictive models that provide prognosis of patients' response. We will provide clinically- relevant interpretations to cross-cultural clinical practice, and assess potential use in a larger multi-country study.

"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user.

"Therapeutic Approaches to Dysarthria:  Acoustic and Perceptual Correlates ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 90% of the 1.5 million Americans living with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and 50% of the 500,000 Americans living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) will experience dysarthria. Dysarthria has devastating consequences for life quality and participation in society due to its effects on employment, leisure activities and social relationships. Knowledge of therapy techniques for maximizing perceived speech adequacy, as indexed by the gold standard perceptual construct of intelligibility is thus of vital importance. Owing to the scarcity of impartial comparative studies, the choice of one technique over others is often based on trial and error or reflects clinician bias, both of which are at odds with evidence-based practice. This project has sought to address this critical gap in knowledge regarding the comparative merits of dysarthria treatment techniques since its inception. Toward this end, published studies from the past funding cycle compared the acoustic and perceptual merits of three common, global dysarthria treatment techniques including 1) rate manipulation, 2) an increased vocal intensity and 3) clear speech in MS and PD as well as age and sex matched neurotypical talkers. Global treatment techniques by their very nature elicit co-occurring acoustic changes (e.g., duration, segmental articulation). Because an explanatory, acoustically-based model of intelligibility is lacking, the acoustic change(s) causing or explainin the improved perceptual outcomes of global treatment techniques are unknown. Determining the acoustic variables explaining intelligibility variation in dysarthria would not only tremendousy advance theoretical understanding of intelligibility but also would strengthen the scientific basis for treatment. Treatment focused on those acoustic variables explanatory for improved intelligibility may further accelerate progress in therapy. Importantly, research from the previous funding cycle suggests the promise of speech analysis-resynthesis for identifying segmental and suprasegmental acoustic variables explanatory for intelligibility in dysarthria. Building upon this work, the overarching goal of the continuation is to contribute towards development of an acoustically-based explanatory model of intelligibility. Our approach 1) employs established perceptual procedures and acoustic measures, 2) uses an innovative analysis-resynthesis technique that permits conclusions concerning the explanatory relationship between acoustic changes accompanying dysarthria therapy techniques and intelligibility, and 3) leverages methods from machine learning to build a predictive model of intelligibility from acoustics. The impact of this work is in its contribution to 1) advancing conceptual understanding of intelligibility, 2) strengthening the scientific basis for treatment, and 3) optimizing clinical implementation of dysarthria therapy techniques.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is directly relevant to the mission of NIDCD due to its focus on investigating the therapeutic techniques for maximizing intelligibility in dysarthra secondary to Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis. By advancing conceptual understanding of intelligibility, this research will strengthen the scientific basis for dysarthria treatments and will optimize their clinical implementation.            ",Therapeutic Approaches to Dysarthria:  Acoustic and Perceptual Correlates,8955720,R01DC004689,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Study', 'Development', 'Dysarthria', 'Employment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Leisure Activities', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clear speech', 'comparative', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment program']",NIDCD,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2015,544862,-0.0014407719690646195
"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse.

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature.

"Computational Approach to Personalized Anemia Management DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective anemia management in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is a complex task due to large variation in erythropoietic response among the ESRD patients. Evidence shows that excessive doses of Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA), used in hypo-responsive patients, coincide with increased cardiovascular complications. In addition to health risks, reimbursement restrictions imposed by Medicare demand additional vigilance in ESA administration. Iron is one of the most important elements affecting the erythropoietic response. The ongoing blood losses associated with hemodialysis treatments, increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and access complications, as well as poor iron absorption lead to iron depletion in ESRD patients. Standard anemia management protocols do not fully address the synergistic nature of interactions between erythropoietin and iron. Personalized strategies for coordinated ESA and iron dosing are therefore necessary to achieve the desired clinical outcome, reduce patient risk exposure, and improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment. Our long-term goal is the advancement of biomedical computing to personalize medicine and pharmacologic management of chronic conditions. The objective of this project is to address the challenge of multiple drug dosing personalization with a specific application to ESA and iron management in anemia of ESRD. The central hypothesis is that a computational approach can be developed to perform coordinated personalized dosing of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and iron in order to achieve desired clinical outcomes and minimize patient exposure resulting in optimal care. The rationale behind the proposed research is that computational models quantifying the interaction between iron and erythropoietin can be applied through the principles of control theory and machine learning, to derive personalized dosing strategies for both agents. The main objective will be accomplished through three specific aims: 1) quantification of the erythropoietin-iron interaction through clinically relevant computational models, 2) application of such models to derive algorithms for coordinated personalized ESA and iron dosing, 3) validation of these algorithms through an ""in sillico"" trial for a wide range o simulated subjects and clinical conditions. The expected outcome of this project is a new systematic approach to the management of ESRD anemia using multiple agents resulting in improved patient care and decreased cost which will be broadly applicable to other therapeutic areas. The proposed research is relevant to public health because personalized dosing of multiple therapeutic agents broadly applicable to many chronic conditions is ultimately expected to improve cost-effectiveness of treatment and minimize patient risk. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH mission because it contributes toward advancement of personalized medicine, one of the top priorities of the NIH.",Computational Approach to Personalized Anemia Management,8914596,R01DK093832,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Area', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Intestines', 'Iron', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare', 'Medication Management', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'gastrointestinal', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'personalized medicine', 'response', 'theories', 'vigilance']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,R01,2015,336757,0.02183153432872097
"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particular, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,8808769,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2015,324063,-0.010390035772860826
"Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of high throughput biological data. Effective methods for analyzing this data must balance two opposing ideals. They must be (a) flexible and sufficiently data-adaptive to deal with the data's complex structure, yet (b) sufficiently simpe and transparent to interpret their results and analyze their uncertainty (so as not to mislead with conviction). This is additionally challenging because these datasets are massive, so attacking these problems requires a marriage of statistical and computational ideas. This project develops frameworks for attacking several problems involving this biological data. These frameworks balance flexibility and simplicity and are computationally tractable even on massive datasets. This application has three specific aims. Aim 1: A flexible and computationally tractable framework for building predictive models. Commonly we are interested in modelling phenotypic traits of an individual using omics data. We would like to find a small subset of genetic features which are important in phenotype expression level. In this approach, I propose a method for flexibly modelling a response variable (e.g. phenotype) with a small, adaptively chosen subset of features, in a computationally scalable fashion. Aim 2: A framework for jointly identifying and testing regions which differ across conditions. For example, in the context of methylation data measured in normal and cancer tissue samples, one might expect that some regions are more methylated in one tissue type or the other. These regions might suggest targets for therapy. However, we do not have the background biological knowledge to pre-specify regions to test. I propose an approach which adaptively selects regions and then tests them in a principled way. This approach is based on a convex formulation to the problem, using shrinkage to achieve sparse differences. Aim 3: A principled framework for developing and evaluating predictive biomarkers during clinical trials. Modern treatments target specific genetic abnormalities that are generally present in only a subset of patients with a disease. A major current goal in medicine is to develop biomarkers that identify those patients likely to benefit from treatment. I propose a framework for developing and testing biomarkers during large-scale clinical trials. This framework simultaneously builds these biomarkers and applies them to restrict enrollment into the trial to only those likely to benefit from treatment. The statistical tools that result from th proposed research will be implemented in freely available software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent advances in high-throughput biotechnology have provided us with a wealth of new biological data, a large step towards unlocking the tantalizing promise of personalized medicine: the tailoring of treatment to the genetic makeup of each individual and disease. However, classical statistical and computational tools have proven unable to exploit the extensive information these new experimental technologies bring to bear.

"Naltrexone Treatment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this international pilot study we use data from four clinical trials of heroin dependence treatment to identify which patients will be better respondents to naltrexone treatment and among respondents which type of naltrexone formulation (oral, implantable, or injectable) leads to the best outcome. Although in the United States naltrexone has been FDA approved for treatment of opioid addiction it has been underutilized. In Russia (where substitution therapy is illegal), naltrexone is the only pharmacological treatment option. Naltrexone is available in three forms: oral and extended release, injectable, and implantable depot-formulations. A novel methodology (Model-based Random Forest, mobForest) (Garge et al. 2013) will be extended to heroin treatment and to the development of a single interpretable parsimonious model. These methods will be applied to combined data from past four naltrexone efficacy randomized double blind, double dummy, placebo- controlled clinical trials and identify which patients are likely to respond to different naltrexone formulations. These studies were conducted in St. Petersburg, Russia, have data on almost 1,000 patients with more than 400 individual-level variables spanning demographics, clinical, genetic, and psychometrics domains.

"Biosignatures of Treatment Remission in Major Depression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is associated with structural, functional, and neurochemical alterations in key interrelated brain circuits involved in emotion, reward, and executive functioning. Current models of its etiology, including genetic   expression, gene environment interactions, the monoamine hypothesis, and neurogenesis guided our choice of biomarkers. We propose to use biomarkers from several levels of organization that address one or more of these models and examine their ability to predict treatment remission. At the genetic level, we will examine epigenetic measures and the transcriptome. At the molecular level, the utility of measures of 5HT1a neuroreceptor binding using Position Emission Tomography and proteomics will be investigated. At the anatomical level, we will examine white matter tract integrity and regional decreases in cortical thickness. Functional assessments include electroencephalography, loudness   dependent auditory evoked potentials, and neurocognitive performance. Clinical features will be studied as well, e.g. presence of anxious depression, family history of depression, and others. While receiving   supportive clinical management, 300 patients will be observed medication free for 3 weeks, to diminish the influence of placebo response and minimize effects on biosignature assays. Those still meeting criteria after the 3 weeks will receive all aforementioned assessments. Patients then will be randomized in a doublemasked fashion to bupropion or escitalopram, two of the most commonly prescribed treatments for depression, with putatively distinct mechanisms of action. Treatment will be for 12-14 weeks. Treatment outcome will be remission, measures of symptomatic improvement, and assessment of adverse events. Non-remitters will be crossed over. Outcomes will be measured with both traditional and contemporary clinical assessments. Patients will be followed for 6 months after randomization to assess maintenance of response and remission. We will also use a comprehensive analysis algorithm, using novel statistical techniques for high dimensional data to develop an optimal predictive model of treatment outcome that includes all data recorded from all modalities. The statistical team will develop new strategies to address the complex data set to be generated by this study. The resulting optimized algorithm for predicting remission can serve as the basis for a new study intended to validate this tool for personalized treatment of depression. Data and biological materials collected in this project would become part of a repository, open to qualified individuals for additional analysis.

"Developing an Evidence-Based Treatment Continuum for Spoken and Written Language DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How can recovery from acquired language impairment be maximized? This question is central to the focus of every clinician and clinical researcher working with adults with aphasia, alexia, and agraphia. Nearly six decades of treatment research has yielded evidence supporting the efficacy of a wide range of language rehabilitation approaches. Unfortunately, the research efforts have been directed toward treatment approaches in isolation, and few, if any, researchers have considered the full scope and sequence of treatments necessary to maximize language recovery. In our current research, we tackled this issue with respect to the treatment of acquired agraphia, yielding evidence to support a treatment continuum for single-word writing. In the current proposal, we aim to build on the re-trained skills to maximize lexical retrieval in the spoken language modality, and to extend the treatment sequence to text-level reading and written composition. Our approach is novel in its focus on the interactive contribution of semantic, phonological, and orthographic processes. This perspective stems from evidence that literate adults have strongly established links among these three central language components, and the promotion of interactive processing of residual (and re-trained) skills in each domain can advance performance at multiple levels within the language system (sublexical, lexical, and sentence). We will examine a hierarchically structured treatment continuum where gaining mastery at a given level provides the scaffolding for advancing to the next level. A decision tree is proposed to guide the sequence for each individual in an algorithmic fashion. Using a case series approach, we propose to implement treatment with 50 individuals who reflect a diverse range of severity levels and behavioral and lesion profiles. Individual responses to treatment will be evaluated relative to performance on a comprehensive assessment of language before and after critical phases of treatment, allowing us to test the proposed algorithm. Language behavior and treatment outcomes will also be considered relative to the location and extent of brain damage affecting critical cortical networks. This work will advance the understanding of sequential treatment outcomes, and will serve to establish guidelines regarding treatment candidacy across the continuum. Ultimately, this study has the potential to change the way that clinicians plan treatment: shifting from the administration of isolated treatments to a planned sequence of interventions to maximize language recovery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than 1 million Americans have persistent acquired language impairment due to brain damage. The rehabilitation of spoken and written language impairments is a high priority for affected individuals, and the quality and efficiency of treatment approaches are critical issues for patients, family members, speech-language pathologists, and third-party payers.

"Informatics to enable routine personalized cancer therapy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic analysis of individual patients is now affordable and therapies targeted to specific molecular aberrations are being tested in clinical trials. However, even highly-specialized physicians at leading academic centers are not equipped to apply genomic information available in publically available sources to clinical- decision-making concerning individual patients. Our central hypothesis is that we can develop informatics tools to support personalized cancer treatment as ""standard of care"" rather than ""one off"" exceptions. We will: 1) implement a bioinformatics pipeline for processing molecular data into actionable profiles, 2) create and maintain a database of therapeutic implications of common genomic aberrations using automated processing of publically-available sources and 3) develop tools to summarize and present patient-specific advice to clinicians. These tools will be based on existing technologies and publicly available data sources. Once tested, we will make these tools available via appropriate open source license.

"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems.

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.

"Computational Approach to Personalized Anemia Management     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective anemia management in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is a complex task due to large variation in erythropoietic response among the ESRD patients. Evidence shows that excessive doses of Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA), used in hypo-responsive patients, coincide with increased cardiovascular complications. In addition to health risks, reimbursement restrictions imposed by Medicare demand additional vigilance in ESA administration. Iron is one of the most important elements affecting the erythropoietic response. The ongoing blood losses associated with hemodialysis treatments, increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and access complications, as well as poor iron absorption lead to iron depletion in ESRD patients. Standard anemia management protocols do not fully address the synergistic nature of interactions between erythropoietin and iron. Personalized strategies for coordinated ESA and iron dosing are therefore necessary to achieve the desired clinical outcome, reduce patient risk exposure, and improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment. Our long-term goal is the advancement of biomedical computing to personalize medicine and pharmacologic management of chronic conditions. The objective of this project is to address the challenge of multiple drug dosing personalization with a specific application to ESA and iron management in anemia of ESRD. The central hypothesis is that a computational approach can be developed to perform coordinated personalized dosing of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and iron in order to achieve desired clinical outcomes and minimize patient exposure resulting in optimal care. The rationale behind the proposed research is that computational models quantifying the interaction between iron and erythropoietin can be applied through the principles of control theory and machine learning, to derive personalized dosing strategies for both agents. The main objective will be accomplished through three specific aims: 1) quantification of the erythropoietin-iron interaction through clinically relevant computational models, 2) application of such models to derive algorithms for coordinated personalized ESA and iron dosing, 3) validation of these algorithms through an ""in sillico"" trial for a wide range o simulated subjects and clinical conditions. The expected outcome of this project is a new systematic approach to the management of ESRD anemia using multiple agents resulting in improved patient care and decreased cost which will be broadly applicable to other therapeutic areas.          The proposed research is relevant to public health because personalized dosing of multiple therapeutic agents broadly applicable to many chronic conditions is ultimately expected to improve cost-effectiveness of treatment and minimize patient risk. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH mission because it contributes toward advancement of personalized medicine, one of the top priorities of the NIH.

"Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of high throughput biological data. Effective methods for analyzing this data must balance two opposing ideals. They must be (a) flexible and sufficiently data-adaptive to deal with the data's complex structure, yet (b) sufficiently simpe and transparent to interpret their results and analyze their uncertainty (so as not to mislead with conviction). This is additionally challenging because these datasets are massive, so attacking these problems requires a marriage of statistical and computational ideas. This project develops frameworks for attacking several problems involving this biological data. These frameworks balance flexibility and simplicity and are computationally tractable even on massive datasets. This application has three specific aims. Aim 1: A flexible and computationally tractable framework for building predictive models. Commonly we are interested in modelling phenotypic traits of an individual using omics data. We would like to find a small subset of genetic features which are important in phenotype expression level. In this approach, I propose a method for flexibly modelling a response variable (e.g. phenotype) with a small, adaptively chosen subset of features, in a computationally scalable fashion. Aim 2: A framework for jointly identifying and testing regions which differ across conditions. For example, in the context of methylation data measured in normal and cancer tissue samples, one might expect that some regions are more methylated in one tissue type or the other. These regions might suggest targets for therapy. However, we do not have the background biological knowledge to pre-specify regions to test. I propose an approach which adaptively selects regions and then tests them in a principled way. This approach is based on a convex formulation to the problem, using shrinkage to achieve sparse differences. Aim 3: A principled framework for developing and evaluating predictive biomarkers during clinical trials. Modern treatments target specific genetic abnormalities that are generally present in only a subset of patients with a disease. A major current goal in medicine is to develop biomarkers that identify those patients likely to benefit from treatment. I propose a framework for developing and testing biomarkers during large-scale clinical trials. This framework simultaneously builds these biomarkers and applies them to restrict enrollment into the trial to only those likely to benefit from treatment. The statistical tools that result from th proposed research will be implemented in freely available software.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent advances in high-throughput biotechnology have provided us with a wealth of new biological data, a large step towards unlocking the tantalizing promise of personalized medicine: the tailoring of treatment to the genetic makeup of each individual and disease. However, classical statistical and computational tools have proven unable to exploit the extensive information these new experimental technologies bring to bear. This project focuses on building new flexible, data-adaptive tools to translate this wealth of low level information into actionable discoveries, and actual biological understanding.            ",Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics,8796068,DP5OD019820,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Enrollment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteomics', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Simulate', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telomerase', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'flexibility', 'high throughput analysis', 'interest', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP5,2014,361063,0.01813965681872481
"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particulr, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pan- creatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.            ",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,8660307,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2014,324364,-0.010747409853374341
"Developing an Evidence-Based Treatment Continuum for Spoken and Written Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How can recovery from acquired language impairment be maximized? This question is central to the focus of every clinician and clinical researcher working with adults with aphasia, alexia, and agraphia. Nearly six decades of treatment research has yielded evidence supporting the efficacy of a wide range of language rehabilitation approaches. Unfortunately, the research efforts have been directed toward treatment approaches in isolation, and few, if any, researchers have considered the full scope and sequence of treatments necessary to maximize language recovery. In our current research, we tackled this issue with respect to the treatment of acquired agraphia, yielding evidence to support a treatment continuum for single-word writing. In the current proposal, we aim to build on the re-trained skills to maximize lexical retrieval in the spoken language modality, and to extend the treatment sequence to text-level reading and written composition. Our approach is novel in its focus on the interactive contribution of semantic, phonological, and orthographic processes. This perspective stems from evidence that literate adults have strongly established links among these three central language components, and the promotion of interactive processing of residual (and re-trained) skills in each domain can advance performance at multiple levels within the language system (sublexical, lexical, and sentence). We will examine a hierarchically structured treatment continuum where gaining mastery at a given level provides the scaffolding for advancing to the next level. A decision tree is proposed to guide the sequence for each individual in an algorithmic fashion. Using a case series approach, we propose to implement treatment with 50 individuals who reflect a diverse range of severity levels and behavioral and lesion profiles. Individual responses to treatment will be evaluated relative to performance on a comprehensive assessment of language before and after critical phases of treatment, allowing us to test the proposed algorithm. Language behavior and treatment outcomes will also be considered relative to the location and extent of brain damage affecting critical cortical networks. This work will advance the understanding of sequential treatment outcomes, and will serve to establish guidelines regarding treatment candidacy across the continuum. Ultimately, this study has the potential to change the way that clinicians plan treatment: shifting from the administration of isolated treatments to a planned sequence of interventions to maximize language recovery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than 1 million Americans have persistent acquired language impairment due to brain damage. The rehabilitation of spoken and written language impairments is a high priority for affected individuals, and the quality and efficiency of treatment approaches are critical issues for patients, family members, speech-language pathologists, and third-party payers. The research proposed here has the potential to significantly impact the planning and implementation of behavioral treatment in a manner that maximizes recovery of function.

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.                ",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,8640521,R01MH103148,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2013,271188,0.011819934513809124
"Computational Approach to Personalized Anemia Management     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective anemia management in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is a complex task due to large variation in erythropoietic response among the ESRD patients. Evidence shows that excessive doses of Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA), used in hypo-responsive patients, coincide with increased cardiovascular complications. In addition to health risks, reimbursement restrictions imposed by Medicare demand additional vigilance in ESA administration. Iron is one of the most important elements affecting the erythropoietic response. The ongoing blood losses associated with hemodialysis treatments, increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and access complications, as well as poor iron absorption lead to iron depletion in ESRD patients. Standard anemia management protocols do not fully address the synergistic nature of interactions between erythropoietin and iron. Personalized strategies for coordinated ESA and iron dosing are therefore necessary to achieve the desired clinical outcome, reduce patient risk exposure, and improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment. Our long-term goal is the advancement of biomedical computing to personalize medicine and pharmacologic management of chronic conditions. The objective of this project is to address the challenge of multiple drug dosing personalization with a specific application to ESA and iron management in anemia of ESRD. The central hypothesis is that a computational approach can be developed to perform coordinated personalized dosing of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and iron in order to achieve desired clinical outcomes and minimize patient exposure resulting in optimal care. The rationale behind the proposed research is that computational models quantifying the interaction between iron and erythropoietin can be applied through the principles of control theory and machine learning, to derive personalized dosing strategies for both agents. The main objective will be accomplished through three specific aims: 1) quantification of the erythropoietin-iron interaction through clinically relevant computational models, 2) application of such models to derive algorithms for coordinated personalized ESA and iron dosing, 3) validation of these algorithms through an ""in sillico"" trial for a wide range o simulated subjects and clinical conditions. The expected outcome of this project is a new systematic approach to the management of ESRD anemia using multiple agents resulting in improved patient care and decreased cost which will be broadly applicable to other therapeutic areas.          The proposed research is relevant to public health because personalized dosing of multiple therapeutic agents broadly applicable to many chronic conditions is ultimately expected to improve cost-effectiveness of treatment and minimize patient risk. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH mission because it contributes toward advancement of personalized medicine, one of the top priorities of the NIH.

"Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization for Rapid IMRT and VMAT Treatment Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has revolutionized the treatment of cancers in the last decade, since it can tightly conform and escalate radiation dose to a tumor while simultaneously protecting nearby radiation- sensitive normal tissues, resulting in better local control and fewer post-treatment complications than previous techniques. However, the process of obtaining a clinically acceptable IMRT plan for a difficult site is still extremely slow, requiring many hours of a busy expert's time in a manual trial-and-error loop of parameter adjustment. The goal of this project is to drastically reduce the amount of time to obtain a clinically acceptable IMRT plan using a new automated method that directly applies constrained optimization in a computationally tractable and clinically meaningful way. The hypothesis is that clinical treatment planning times using this technique will be reduced from several hours to a matter of minutes.  The new approach, called ROCO (Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization) translates well-established concepts from optimization and machine learning theory to the novel application of IMRT planning, exploiting the speed and ease of unconstrained optimizations and introducing a dimensionality reduction step that makes true constrained optimization tractable. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to (1) apply Reduced-Order Con- strained Optimization to IMRT planning for non-small cell lung cancers and nasopharynx cancers, where the planning process is highly time-consuming; (2) develop and extend the Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization paradigm to a promising IMRT variant called Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for the prostate site, which is currently nearly clinically intractable to plan; and (3) integrate the new tools into the clinical IMRT planning process at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, using a powered study to verify the hypothesis that the proposed method significantly improves planning speed. The experiments will be designed in consultation with an expert clinical treatment planner and biostatistician, and carefully validated using anonymized data from approximately 50 patients for each site.  The main benefit of the proposed approach is to drastically reduce planning times, which is critical if IMRT and VMAT are to reach their full potential in clinical application. In a busy clinic, long planning times place a severe stress on available resources, and can result in treatment delays, acceptance of sub-optimal plans or - in the worst case - errors due to time pressure. In the longer term, the proposed approach will provide deeper insight into the critical elements of the dose optimization problem, significantly reduce the trial-and-error effort characteristic of current IMRT planning, and reduce subjectivity in treatment plan selection.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician. This proposal describes a new, automatic method for treatment plan optimization that is very fast, requiring only minutes to produce a plan that directly meets all the physician's constraints, potentially saving much time for a busy clinic.

"Decision support for dose prescription in radiation treatment planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent advances in radiation therapy [1], such as Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) and Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT), offer the ability to maximize tumor control while reducing the risk of radiation-induced damage to adjacent normal tissue. Typically, radiation therapy involves three phases: (1) prescription - where radiation oncologists (physicians) specify the dose constraints for targets and organs at risk (OAR); (2) planning - where treatment planners (physicists, dosimetrists) determine the treatment parameters to achieve the prescribed dose constraints; and (3) treatment - where therapists carry out the plan to treat the patients. In current practice, radiation oncologists typically draw on a variety of sources for dose prescription, including the 1991 ""Emami"" paper [8] on normal tissue tolerance, updated guidance from QUANTEC, other data in journals and texts, and their personal experiences. While these provide a general understanding of the dependence of normal tissue complication on dose distribution or the upper limits of the organ tolerance in populations of patients, their application to an individual patient is less certain and precise. Application of data and guidelines that are available in the literature is further complicated by the fact that this information is available only as narrative texts, tables and charts that are difficult to quantitatively integrate into clinical practice. Furthermore, the existing guidelines do not consider patient specific information regarding the ideal dose distribution achievable at individual treatments [9]. Radiation oncologists are frequently forced to make difficult prescription decisions by synthesizing available population level guidelines, personal experience, and their understanding of the specific patient needs on an ad hoc basis. Our overarching goal is to improve outcome by providing evidence-based decision support for radiation oncologists, planners, and therapists in every phase of the treatment process. In this project we propose to develop practical and clinically useful decision support tools to help radiation oncologists prescribe patient- specific optimal dose constraints. The specific aims are (1) Provide radiation oncologists with reliable predictions of patient-specific dose distributions achievable for the patient's anatomy and tumor volume; and (2) Provide radiation oncologists with intuitive tools that integrate patient-specific dose predictions with population-based dose guidelines to support prescription decision making. We believe the technologies developed in this project will not only improve the quality of radiotherapy prescriptions but also reduce planning time with optimal dose constraints and improve clinical outcomes.         In this project we propose to develop practical and clinically useful decision support tools to help radiation oncologists prescribe patient-specific optimal dose constraints. The technologies developed in this project will not only improve the quality of radiotherapy prescriptions but also reduce planning time with optimal dose constraints and improve clinical outcomes.

"Discovering Tailoring Variables in Childhood Mental Health Treatment Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood psychiatric conditions often require that clinicians make individualized treatment decisions. In an exciting trend in child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) research and practice, there is growing interest and awareness in developing individualized decision rules (IDRs). IDRs use sociodemographic information, illness history, comorbidities, family/interpersonal measures, or biomarkers as inputs and then recommend the type, modality, and intensity or delivery of subsequent treatment(s) as outputs. IDRs provide a framework for personalized medicine: the level of personalization increases in proportion to the amount of useful information (tailoring variables) used as inputs in an IDR. The development of IDRs for the treatment of children with mental illness is an important ""next step"" in interventions research. Large scale clinical trials have established efficacious interventions fr many of the common CAMH disorders. However, despite a strong evidence base for treatments that are effective on average, little is known about which children are more or less likely to benefit from one treatment or another. Before IDRs can fulfill their potential, much methodological work remains to be done regarding how to use currently available data to assist in their development. A key step in developing effective IDRs is identifying tailoring variables to  use as inputs. Tailoring variables are special types of pre-treatment measures that pinpoint which treatment is best for whom. Existing methods do not explicitly (a) identify which measures are most useful (tailoring variable selection), or (b) combine them in an optimal fashion (tailorin variable feature construction). The specific aims of this study are: Aim 1 (Methods). To develop and evaluate a framework for (a) tailoring variable selection and (b) tailoring variable feature construction for individualizing CAMH treatment. The new method will be used to address scientific questions such as: (a) What are the most important measures (e.g., demographic, severity and duration of illness, comorbidity, parental psychopathology, psychosocial environment including family and peer relationships, biological) to use for tailoring treatment? (b) How do we combine them in order to guide treatment decisions (e.g., individual psychotherapy treatment, medication, or their combination)? Aim 2 (Application): To illustrate and evaluate the method by applying it to the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study randomized trial data to construct an IDR for choosing between SSRI, CBT, or SSRI+CBT for children with anxiety disorders. We will apply the new methodology to identify variables and features pinpointing children who are more or less likely to benefit from SSRI, CBT, or combined SSRI+CBT. Results will be used to construct a proposed IDR for pediatric anxiety disorders. We will compare how average symptom and severity outcomes differ on the IDR vs SSRI for all vs CBT for all vs SSRI+CBT for all. This study will provide researchers in CAMH with a novel tool for building IDRs. This study has significant public health impact because it aims to develop tools to personalize treatment for children and adolescents with mental health disorders. This is a high-priority area of research for the National Institute of Mental Health. This project aims to develop a new tool for deciding how to personalize (that is, individualize or  customize) treatment for children and adolescents with mental health disorders.

"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particulr, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pan- creatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group.

"Neural Network Predictors of Treatment Outcome Among Adolescent Assault Victims     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for a NIMH Exploratory/Developmental Grant Award (R21) seeks to identify neural functional connectivity patterns associated with response to Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) among female adolescent assault victims. Adolescent assault exposure is a potent risk factor for persistent psychopathology, most notably PTSD. TF-CBT is the only treatment for adolescent PTSD victims with strong empirical support, yet response to TF-CBT is variable and many victims continue to exhibit clinically significant symptoms following treatment. The overall goal of this proposal is to use computational neuroscience tools to predict and understand treatment response among this vulnerable population. Based on human neuroimaging studies demonstrating altered activity and connectivity within neural networks mediating emotion reactivity and emotion regulation among PTSD victims, we hypothesize that patterns of functional connectivity within these neural networks can be used to predict and understand response to TF-CBT among adolescent assault victims. 45 adolescent assault victims aged 11-16 will be provided with a 12-week course of TF-CBT. Participants will undergo fMRI scanning while engaged in emotion reactivity and emotion regulation tasks before and after treatment. A combination of graph theory analyses and support vector classification and regression will be used to identify pre-treatment patterns of functional connectivity that predict subsequent response to TF-CBT (Aim 1). Graph theory analyses will similarly be used to identify changes in network organization from pre-to-post-treatment associated with successful (Aim 2) and unsuccessful (Aim 3) treatment response. This analytic approach to the clinical problem of understanding the variable response to TF-CBT will foster concrete algorithms to be used by a clinician to predict a child's treatment response, which is the first step towards personalizing treatments for this vulnerable population. Further, this analytic approach will identify the essential neural mechanism mediating treatment response and provide targets for the development of novel treatment components. This application proposes a novel approach towards understanding treatment response among a vulnerable adolescent population and will hopefully facilitate the development of more consistent interventions to ameliorate the high cost associated with adolescent assault exposure.          This proposal investigates neural network predictors of treatment outcome among assaulted adolescent girls. This research will lead to a better understanding of how treatment works and why some children do not respond to treatment.

"Biosignatures of Treatment Remission in Major Depression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is associated with structural, functional, and neurochemical alterations in key interrelated brain circuits involved in emotion, reward, and executive functioning. Current models of its etiology, including genetic   expression, gene environment interactions, the monoamine hypothesis, and neurogenesis guided our choice of biomarkers. We propose to use biomarkers from several levels of organization that address one or more of these models and examine their ability to predict treatment remission. At the genetic level, we will examine epigenetic measures and the transcriptome. At the molecular level, the utility of measures of 5HT1a neuroreceptor binding using Position Emission Tomography and proteomics will be investigated. At the anatomical level, we will examine white matter tract integrity and regional decreases in cortical thickness. Functional assessments include electroencephalography, loudness   dependent auditory evoked potentials, and neurocognitive performance. Clinical features will be studied as well, e.g. presence of anxious depression, family history of depression, and others. While receiving   supportive clinical management, 300 patients will be observed medication free for 3 weeks, to diminish the influence of placebo response and minimize effects on biosignature assays. Those still meeting criteria after the 3 weeks will receive all aforementioned assessments. Patients then will be randomized in a doublemasked fashion to bupropion or escitalopram, two of the most commonly prescribed treatments for depression, with putatively distinct mechanisms of action. Treatment will be for 12-14 weeks. Treatment outcome will be remission, measures of symptomatic improvement, and assessment of adverse events. Non-remitters will be crossed over. Outcomes will be measured with both traditional and contemporary clinical assessments. Patients will be followed for 6 months after randomization to assess maintenance of response and remission. We will also use a comprehensive analysis algorithm, using novel statistical techniques for high dimensional data to develop an optimal predictive model of treatment outcome that includes all data recorded from all modalities. The statistical team will develop new strategies to address the complex data set to be generated by this study.

"Biosignatures of Treatment Remission in Major Depression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is associated with structural, functional, and neurochemical alterations in key interrelated brain circuits involved in emotion, reward, and executive functioning. Current models of its etiology, including genetic   expression, gene environment interactions, the monoamine hypothesis, and neurogenesis guided our choice of biomarkers. We propose to use biomarkers from several levels of organization that address one or more of these models and examine their ability to predict treatment remission. At the genetic level, we will examine epigenetic measures and the transcriptome. At the molecular level, the utility of measures of 5HT1a neuroreceptor binding using Position Emission Tomography and proteomics will be investigated. At the anatomical level, we will examine white matter tract integrity and regional decreases in cortical thickness. Functional assessments include electroencephalography, loudness   dependent auditory evoked potentials, and neurocognitive performance. Clinical features will be studied as well, e.g. presence of anxious depression, family history of depression, and others. While receiving   supportive clinical management, 300 patients will be observed medication free for 3 weeks, to diminish the influence of placebo response and minimize effects on biosignature assays. Those still meeting criteria after the 3 weeks will receive all aforementioned assessments. Patients then will be randomized in a doublemasked fashion to bupropion or escitalopram, two of the most commonly prescribed treatments for depression, with putatively distinct mechanisms of action. Treatment will be for 12-14 weeks. Treatment outcome will be remission, measures of symptomatic improvement, and assessment of adverse events. Non-remitters will be crossed over. Outcomes will be measured with both traditional and contemporary clinical assessments. Patients will be followed for 6 months after randomization to assess maintenance of response and remission. We will also use a comprehensive analysis algorithm, using novel statistical techniques for high dimensional data to develop an optimal predictive model of treatment outcome that includes all data recorded from all modalities. The statistical team will develop new strategies to address the complex data set to be generated by this study. The resulting optimized algorithm for predicting remission can serve as the basis for a new study intended to validate this tool for personalized treatment of depression.

"Inflammation and cardiovascular disease in RA     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive, systemic, inflammatory disease that primarily attacks peripheral joints and surrounding tendons and ligaments. This often very painful and debilitating disease affects approximately 1.3 million Americans, of which about 70% are women. 10% of affected subjects suffer total disability. Over the last decade there have been considerable advances in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The use of biologic agents that antagonize tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has resulted in decreased morbidity as well as clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life. Nevertheless, a considerable proportion of RA patients, ranging from 20% to 50% in clinical trials, failed to mount a robust clinical response to these agents. Given the very high cost and potential serious toxicities associated with TNF antagonists, identification of predictors of the response to TNF antagonist therapy would help to optimize the clinical management of RA patients.  Novel optical tomographic imaging (OTI) methods have been developed in recent years and are currently tested for various clinical application ranging from breast cancer imaging to imaging of brain activities. This novel technology promises to offer new insights into the various disease processes without the use of ionizing radiation at a relatively low cost. The group of Dr. Hielscher has recently shown that OTI is particularly sensitive to small changes in finger joints affected by RA. These changes manifest themselves in differences in the optical absorption and scattering coefficients inside these joints, which come about by changes in the optical properties of the synovial fluid as well as the vasculature surrounding the joints.  We hypothesize that optical tomographic imaging (OTI) methods will be able to detect changes occurring in arthritic joints that are treated with TNF antagonist within the first few months or even weeks of treatment initiation. Therefore, the specific aim of this revision application is to perform a longitudinal observational pilot study with 20 RA patients to identify optical imaging biomarkers that can be used to predict treatment outcome. In particular we expect that patients who respond to the treatment will show an increase in the variation of the scattering and absorption coefficient across the joint. In addition, both absorption and scattering coefficients will decreas. In patients for whom treatment response is not observed, no changes will be observed over the course of the treatment. A successful study would provide preliminary data for a more extensive grant application by a newly formed interdisciplinary team of NIAMS researchers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a painful and debilitating disease affecting approximately 1.5 million Americans. The last decade has seen the development of a new group of RA drugs called biologic response modifiers or biologics that can greatly improve the quality of life. However, not all patients respond to these new drugs and given the very high cost and potential serious side effects it is highly desirable to find biomarkers that can predict f a patient will respond to a particular drug or not. We propose to test in a clinical pilot study involving 20 RA patients, if a novel optical imaging system can be used to predict treatment outcome within a few weeks of treatment initiation.            ",Inflammation and cardiovascular disease in RA,8585677,R01AR050026,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'American', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Applications Grants', 'Arthritis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Modifying Second-Line Drugs', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Finger joint structure', 'Fingers', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Joints', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Methotrexate', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Optical Methods', 'Optical Tomography', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Surgeon', 'Synovial Fluid', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'absorption', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'college', 'cost', 'disability', 'follow-up', 'healthy volunteer', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'rheumatologist', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2013,147421,0.011061995509405663
"Developing an Evidence-Based Treatment Continuum for Spoken and Written Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How can recovery from acquired language impairment be maximized? This question is central to the focus of every clinician and clinical researcher working with adults with aphasia, alexia, and agraphia. Nearly six decades of treatment research has yielded evidence supporting the efficacy of a wide range of language rehabilitation approaches. Unfortunately, the research efforts have been directed toward treatment approaches in isolation, and few, if any, researchers have considered the full scope and sequence of treatments necessary to maximize language recovery. In our current research, we tackled this issue with respect to the treatment of acquired agraphia, yielding evidence to support a treatment continuum for single-word writing. In the current proposal, we aim to build on the re-trained skills to maximize lexical retrieval in the spoken language modality, and to extend the treatment sequence to text-level reading and written composition. Our approach is novel in its focus on the interactive contribution of semantic, phonological, and orthographic processes. This perspective stems from evidence that literate adults have strongly established links among these three central language components, and the promotion of interactive processing of residual (and re-trained) skills in each domain can advance performance at multiple levels within the language system (sublexical, lexical, and sentence). We will examine a hierarchically structured treatment continuum where gaining mastery at a given level provides the scaffolding for advancing to the next level. A decision tree is proposed to guide the sequence for each individual in an algorithmic fashion. Using a case series approach, we propose to implement treatment with 50 individuals who reflect a diverse range of severity levels and behavioral and lesion profiles. Individual responses to treatment will be evaluated relative to performance on a comprehensive assessment of language before and after critical phases of treatment, allowing us to test the proposed algorithm. Language behavior and treatment outcomes will also be considered relative to the location and extent of brain damage affecting critical cortical networks. This work will advance the understanding of sequential treatment outcomes, and will serve to establish guidelines regarding treatment candidacy across the continuum. Ultimately, this study has the potential to change the way that clinicians plan treatment: shifting from the administration of isolated treatments to a planned sequence of interventions to maximize language recovery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than 1 million Americans have persistent acquired language impairment due to brain damage. The rehabilitation of spoken and written language impairments is a high priority for affected individuals, and the quality and efficiency of treatment approaches are critical issues for patients, family members, speech-language pathologists, and third-party payers. The research proposed here has the potential to significantly impact the planning and implementation of behavioral treatment in a manner that maximizes recovery of function.

"Informatics to enable routine personalized cancer therapy  Program Director/Principal Investigator (Bernstam, Elmer Victor) Abstract Genomic analysis of individual patients is now affordable and therapies targeted to specific molecular aberrations are being tested in clinical trials. However, even highly-specialized physicians at leading academic centers are not equipped to apply genomic information available in publically available sources to clinical- decision-making concerning individual patients. Our central hypothesis is that we can develop informatics tools to support personalized cancer treatment as ""standard of care"" rather than ""one off"" exceptions. We will: 1) implement a bioinformatics pipeline for processing molecular data into actionable profiles, 2) create and maintain a database of therapeutic implications of common genomic aberrations using automated processing of publically-available sources and 3) develop tools to summarize and present patient-specific advice to clinicians.

"High-Throughput Computing for a Multi-Plan Framework in Radiotherapy  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Computerized planning for radiation delivery via either external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or intensity- modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) from linear accelerators is a complex process involving a large amount of input data and vast numbers of decision variables. Such large-scale combinatorial optimization problems are typically intractable for conventional approaches such as the direct application of the best available commercial algorithms, and thus specialized methods that take advantage of problem structure are required. Radiation treatment planning (RTP) problems are further complicated by the fact that they are multi-objective, that is, the RTP optimization process must take into account a trade-off between the competing goals of delivering appropriate doses to the tumor and avoiding the delivery of harmful radiation to nearby healthy organs. The goal of this proposal is to harness distributive computing via the Condor system for High Throughput Computing (HTC) within an RTP environment. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1) To develop a Nested Partitions (NP) framework that guides a global search process for optimal IMRT delivery parameters using HTC. 2) To develop parallel HTC-based linear programming (LP) methods to efficiently solve the dose optimization problem in IMRT for each given set of beam angles or beam apertures. (3) To exploit a high-throughput computing (HTC) environment and the developed NP/LP/segmentation framework to efficiently generate multiple plans for each given patient case. (4) To couple this multi-plan framework with a decision support system (DSS) that includes planning surface models, a graphical-user-interface (GUI) and machine learning tools to prediction OAR complication in order to aid in the ranking and selection of the generated treatment plans. This proposal requires a multi-disciplinary approach that is best conducted within the framework of the Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology program announcement. It brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in medical physics, mathematical programming, industrial engineering and clinical radiation oncology that is crucial to the development of the proposed multi- plan framework using HTC in radiation therapy.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a multi-dimensional platform for sophisticated treatment planning of radiation delivery. It will develop novel algorithms that will enable generation of superior treatment plans with the added advantage of increasing the speed of treatment planning. Further, it will allow physicians to know beforehand the quality of the treatment plan relative to the multiple treatment objectives and be able to determine the treatment complication scenario beforehand.",High-Throughput Computing for a Multi-Plan Framework in Radiotherapy,8271284,R01CA130814,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Generations', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Accelerator Radiotherapy Systems', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'combinatorial', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'computing resources', 'direct application', 'graphical user interface', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2012,297329,0.02839550204652856
"SmartTool for Anomaly Detection in Radiotherapy Treatment Plan Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Adverse events and medical errors result in thousands of accidental deaths and over one million excess injuries each year. To avoid medical errors in radiation cancer treatment, careful attention needs to be made to ensure accurate implementation of the intended treatment plan. We propose a SmartTool to automatically detect and highlight potential errors in a radiotherapy treatment plan, in real time and before its execution. SmartTool will double check all the treatment parameters in the background against a previously built Predictive Model of a Medical Error (PMME) and flag the operator, [post human QA,] if there is a discrepancy in the treatment plan, by stopping execution, highlighting the outlier treatment parameter and prompting human intervention. To build the PMME we will mine the dataset of previously treated cancer patients, by clustering the data in the groups based on treatment parameter similarity, labeling the clusters and using an innovative algorithm to build a highly accurate anomaly detection tool. PMME will also be dynamically updated [to include new treatment data instances coming in to the system, and updating the model should any treatment flags be identified as false positive or false negative]. The vastly innovative aspect of SmartTool is in the novel use of machine learning techniques to automatically build an anomaly prediction model on unlabeled data (customarily a labeled data is required to build a predictive model) and provide an automatic, real time and unobtrusive intelligent computational treatment checking algorithm. Moreover, having an analytical model of an outlier/anomaly offers the capability to describe the conditions of the outlier being created and is the essential in gaining investigative (and medical) insight in what went wrong and how to improve the process in the future. SmartTool can also be applied in a variety of other medical areas (e.g. predicting errors in pharmacy, laboratory data, and treatment procedure data), to detect anomalies and describe them, offering potential novel medical discoveries and a prospect of saving thousands more lives, with a vast commercialization aspect.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposal is aimed at promoting research and development in biomedical computational science and technology that is consistent with the objective of the NIH and NCI to support rapid progress in areas of scientific opportunity in biomedical research, and enhancing the public health.

"Computational Approach to Personalized Anemia Management     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective anemia management in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is a complex task due to large variation in erythropoietic response among the ESRD patients. Evidence shows that excessive doses of Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA), used in hypo-responsive patients, coincide with increased cardiovascular complications. In addition to health risks, reimbursement restrictions imposed by Medicare demand additional vigilance in ESA administration. Iron is one of the most important elements affecting the erythropoietic response. The ongoing blood losses associated with hemodialysis treatments, increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and access complications, as well as poor iron absorption lead to iron depletion in ESRD patients. Standard anemia management protocols do not fully address the synergistic nature of interactions between erythropoietin and iron. Personalized strategies for coordinated ESA and iron dosing are therefore necessary to achieve the desired clinical outcome, reduce patient risk exposure, and improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment. Our long-term goal is the advancement of biomedical computing to personalize medicine and pharmacologic management of chronic conditions. The objective of this project is to address the challenge of multiple drug dosing personalization with a specific application to ESA and iron management in anemia of ESRD. The central hypothesis is that a computational approach can be developed to perform coordinated personalized dosing of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and iron in order to achieve desired clinical outcomes and minimize patient exposure resulting in optimal care. The rationale behind the proposed research is that computational models quantifying the interaction between iron and erythropoietin can be applied through the principles of control theory and machine learning, to derive personalized dosing strategies for both agents. The main objective will be accomplished through three specific aims: 1) quantification of the erythropoietin-iron interaction through clinically relevant computational models, 2) application of such models to derive algorithms for coordinated personalized ESA and iron dosing, 3) validation of these algorithms through an ""in sillico"" trial for a wide range o simulated subjects and clinical conditions. The expected outcome of this project is a new systematic approach to the management of ESRD anemia using multiple agents resulting in improved patient care and decreased cost which will be broadly applicable to other therapeutic areas.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because personalized dosing of multiple therapeutic agents broadly applicable to many chronic conditions is ultimately expected to improve cost-effectiveness of treatment and minimize patient risk. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH mission because it contributes toward advancement of personalized medicine, one of the top priorities of the NIH.                    The proposed research is relevant to public health because personalized dosing of multiple therapeutic agents broadly applicable to many chronic conditions is ultimately expected to improve cost-effectiveness of treatment and minimize patient risk.

"Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization for Rapid IMRT and VMAT Treatment Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has revolutionized the treatment of cancers in the last decade, since it can tightly conform and escalate radiation dose to a tumor while simultaneously protecting nearby radiation- sensitive normal tissues, resulting in better local control and fewer post-treatment complications than previous techniques. However, the process of obtaining a clinically acceptable IMRT plan for a difficult site is still extremely slow, requiring many hours of a busy expert's time in a manual trial-and-error loop of parameter adjustment. The goal of this project is to drastically reduce the amount of time to obtain a clinically acceptable IMRT plan using a new automated method that directly applies constrained optimization in a computationally tractable and clinically meaningful way. The hypothesis is that clinical treatment planning times using this technique will be reduced from several hours to a matter of minutes.  The new approach, called ROCO (Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization) translates well-established concepts from optimization and machine learning theory to the novel application of IMRT planning, exploiting the speed and ease of unconstrained optimizations and introducing a dimensionality reduction step that makes true constrained optimization tractable. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to (1) apply Reduced-Order Con- strained Optimization to IMRT planning for non-small cell lung cancers and nasopharynx cancers, where the planning process is highly time-consuming; (2) develop and extend the Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization paradigm to a promising IMRT variant called Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for the prostate site, which is currently nearly clinically intractable to plan; and (3) integrate the new tools into the clinical IMRT planning process at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, using a powered study to verify the hypothesis that the proposed method significantly improves planning speed. The experiments will be designed in consultation with an expert clinical treatment planner and biostatistician, and carefully validated using anonymized data from approximately 50 patients for each site.  The main benefit of the proposed approach is to drastically reduce planning times, which is critical if IMRT and VMAT are to reach their full potential in clinical application. In a busy clinic, long planning times place a severe stress on available resources, and can result in treatment delays, acceptance of sub-optimal plans or - in the worst case - errors due to time pressure. In the longer term, the proposed approach will provide deeper insight into the critical elements of the dose optimization problem, significantly reduce the trial-and-error effort characteristic of current IMRT planning, and reduce subjectivity in treatment plan selection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician.

"Decision support for dose prescription in radiation treatment planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent advances in radiation therapy [1], such as Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) and Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT), offer the ability to maximize tumor control while reducing the risk of radiation-induced damage to adjacent normal tissue. Typically, radiation therapy involves three phases: (1) prescription - where radiation oncologists (physicians) specify the dose constraints for targets and organs at risk (OAR); (2) planning - where treatment planners (physicists, dosimetrists) determine the treatment parameters to achieve the prescribed dose constraints; and (3) treatment - where therapists carry out the plan to treat the patients. In current practice, radiation oncologists typically draw on a variety of sources for dose prescription, including the 1991 ""Emami"" paper [8] on normal tissue tolerance, updated guidance from QUANTEC, other data in journals and texts, and their personal experiences. While these provide a general understanding of the dependence of normal tissue complication on dose distribution or the upper limits of the organ tolerance in populations of patients, their application to an individual patient is less certain and precise. Application of data and guidelines that are available in the literature is further complicated by the fact that this information is available only as narrative texts, tables and charts that are difficult to quantitatively integrate into clinical practice. Furthermore, the existing guidelines do not consider patient specific information regarding the ideal dose distribution achievable at individual treatments [9]. Radiation oncologists are frequently forced to make difficult prescription decisions by synthesizing available population level guidelines, personal experience, and their understanding of the specific patient needs on an ad hoc basis. Our overarching goal is to improve outcome by providing evidence-based decision support for radiation oncologists, planners, and therapists in every phase of the treatment process. In this project we propose to develop practical and clinically useful decision support tools to help radiation oncologists prescribe patient- specific optimal dose constraints. The specific aims are (1) Provide radiation oncologists with reliable predictions of patient-specific dose distributions achievable for the patient's anatomy and tumor volume; and (2) Provide radiation oncologists with intuitive tools that integrate patient-specific dose predictions with population-based dose guidelines to support prescription decision making. We believe the technologies developed in this project will not only improve the quality of radiotherapy prescriptions but also reduce planning time with optimal dose constraints and improve clinical outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this project we propose to develop practical and clinically useful decision support tools to help radiation oncologists prescribe patient-specific optimal dose constraints.

"Discovering Tailoring Variables in Childhood Mental Health Treatment Research     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Childhood psychiatric conditions often require that clinicians make individualized treatment decisions. In an exciting trend in child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) research and practice, there is growing interest and awareness in developing individualized decision rules (IDRs). IDRs use sociodemographic information, illness history, comorbidities, family/interpersonal measures, or biomarkers as inputs and then recommend the type, modality, and intensity or delivery of subsequent treatment(s) as outputs. IDRs provide a framework for personalized medicine: the level of personalization increases in proportion to the amount of useful information (tailoring variables) used as inputs in an IDR. The development of IDRs for the treatment of children with mental illness is an important ""next step"" in interventions research. Large scale clinical trials have established efficacious interventions fr many of the common CAMH disorders. However, despite a strong evidence base for treatments that are effective on average, little is known about which children are more or less likely to benefit from one treatment or another. Before IDRs can fulfill their potential, much methodological work remains to be done regarding how to use currently available data to assist in their development. A key step in developing effective IDRs is identifying tailoring variables to use as inputs. Tailoring variables are special types of pre-treatment measures that pinpoint which treatment is best for whom. Existing methods do not explicitly (a) identify which measures are most useful (tailoring variable selection), or (b) combine them in an optimal fashion (tailorin variable feature construction). The specific aims of this study are: Aim 1 (Methods). To develop and evaluate a framework for (a) tailoring variable selection and (b) tailoring variable feature construction for individualizing CAMH treatment. The new method will be used to address scientific questions such as: (a) What are the most important measures (e.g., demographic, severity and duration of illness, comorbidity, parental psychopathology, psychosocial environment including family and peer relationships, biological) to use for tailoring treatment? (b) How do we combine them in order to guide treatment decisions (e.g., individual psychotherapy treatment, medication, or their combination)? Aim 2 (Application): To illustrate and evaluate the method by applying it to the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study randomized trial data to construct an IDR for choosing between SSRI, CBT, or SSRI+CBT for children with anxiety disorders. We will apply the new methodology to identify variables and features pinpointing children who are more or less likely to benefit from SSRI, CBT, or combined SSRI+CBT. Results will be used to construct a proposed IDR for pediatric anxiety disorders. We will compare how average symptom and severity outcomes differ on the IDR vs SSRI for all vs CBT for all vs SSRI+CBT for all.  This study will provide researchers in CAMH with a novel tool for building IDRs. This study has significant public health impact because it aims to develop tools to personalize treatment for children and adolescents with mental health disorders. This is a high-priority area of research for the National Institute of Mental Health.                  PROJEC NARRAIVE: Thspojectaimstodevelopanew too fo decdnghow topesonlze(thatis,indvdulzeo  cusomiz)tramn forchildrnandadolscns ihmnalhalhdisoThrdsrhs.simpotnt cinclandpu-hbeialcthrelevancebecause, althoughrserchhsestbished efccioustretments o mny chldandadolescent mentlhelthdsoders,ltteisknown bout whichchldenaemoeo lsslikly obnfitfrom on ramn oranohr.",Discovering Tailoring Variables in Childhood Mental Health Treatment Research,8359143,R03MH097954,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Seminal', 'Sertraline', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Sterile coverings', 'Symptoms', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2012,87008,0.012246103531516672
"Neural Network Predictors of Treatment Outcome Among Adolescent Assault Victims     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for a NIMH Exploratory/Developmental Grant Award (R21) seeks to identify neural functional connectivity patterns associated with response to Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) among female adolescent assault victims. Adolescent assault exposure is a potent risk factor for persistent psychopathology, most notably PTSD. TF-CBT is the only treatment for adolescent PTSD victims with strong empirical support, yet response to TF-CBT is variable and many victims continue to exhibit clinically significant symptoms following treatment. The overall goal of this proposal is to use computational neuroscience tools to predict and understand treatment response among this vulnerable population. Based on human neuroimaging studies demonstrating altered activity and connectivity within neural networks mediating emotion reactivity and emotion regulation among PTSD victims, we hypothesize that patterns of functional connectivity within these neural networks can be used to predict and understand response to TF-CBT among adolescent assault victims. 45 adolescent assault victims aged 11-16 will be provided with a 12-week course of TF-CBT. Participants will undergo fMRI scanning while engaged in emotion reactivity and emotion regulation tasks before and after treatment. A combination of graph theory analyses and support vector classification and regression will be used to identify pre-treatment patterns of functional connectivity that predict subsequent response to TF-CBT (Aim 1). Graph theory analyses will similarly be used to identify changes in network organization from pre-to-post-treatment associated with successful (Aim 2) and unsuccessful (Aim 3) treatment response. This analytic approach to the clinical problem of understanding the variable response to TF-CBT will foster concrete algorithms to be used by a clinician to predict a child's treatment response, which is the first step towards personalizing treatments for this vulnerable population. Further, this analytic approach will identify the essential neural mechanism mediating treatment response and provide targets for the development of novel treatment components. This application proposes a novel approach towards understanding treatment response among a vulnerable adolescent population and will hopefully facilitate the development of more consistent interventions to ameliorate the high cost associated with adolescent assault exposure.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal investigates neural network predictors of treatment outcome among assaulted adolescent girls. This research will lead to a better understanding of how treatment works and why some children do not respond to treatment.              This proposal investigates neural network predictors of treatment outcome among assaulted adolescent girls.

"Biosignatures of Treatment Remission in Major Depression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is associated with structural, functional, and neurochemical alterations in key interrelated brain circuits involved in emotion, reward, and executive functioning. Current models of its etiology, including genetic expression, gene environment interactions, the monoamine hypothesis, and neurogenesis guided our choice of biomarkers. We propose to use biomarkers from several levels of organization that address one or more of these models and examine their ability to predict treatment remission. At the genetic level, we will examine epigenetic measures and the transcriptome. At the molecular level, the utility of measures of 5HT1a neuroreceptor binding using Position Emission Tomography and proteomics will be investigated. At the anatomical level, we will examine white matter tract integrity and regional decreases in cortical thickness. Functional assessments include electroencephalography, loudness   dependent auditory evoked potentials, and neurocognitive performance. Clinical features will be studied as well, e.g. presence of anxious depression, family history of depression, and others. While receiving   supportive clinical management, 300 patients will be observed medication free for 3 weeks, to diminish the influence of placebo response and minimize effects on biosignature assays. Those still meeting criteria after the 3 weeks will receive all aforementioned assessments. Patients then will be randomized in a doublemasked fashion to bupropion or escitalopram, two of the most commonly prescribed treatments for depression, with putatively distinct mechanisms of action. Treatment will be for 12-14 weeks. Treatment outcome will be remission, measures of symptomatic improvement, and assessment of adverse events. Non-remitters will be crossed over. Outcomes will be measured with both traditional and contemporary clinical assessments. Patients will be followed for 6 months after randomization to assess maintenance of response and remission. We will also use a comprehensive analysis algorithm, using novel statistical techniques for high dimensional data to develop an optimal predictive model of treatment outcome that includes all data recorded from all modalities. The statistical team will develop new strategies to address the complex data set to be generated by this study. The resulting optimized algorithm for predicting remission can serve as the basis for a new study intended to validate this tool for personalized treatment of depression. Data and biological materials collected in this project would become part of a repository, open to qualified individuals for additional analysis.

"Developing an Evidence-Based Treatment Continuum for Spoken and Written Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How can recovery from acquired language impairment be maximized? This question is central to the focus of every clinician and clinical researcher working with adults with aphasia, alexia, and agraphia. Nearly six decades of treatment research has yielded evidence supporting the efficacy of a wide range of language rehabilitation approaches. Unfortunately, the research efforts have been directed toward treatment approaches in isolation, and few, if any, researchers have considered the full scope and sequence of treatments necessary to maximize language recovery. In our current research, we tackled this issue with respect to the treatment of acquired agraphia, yielding evidence to support a treatment continuum for single-word writing. In the current proposal, we aim to build on the re-trained skills to maximize lexical retrieval in the spoken language modality, and to extend the treatment sequence to text-level reading and written composition. Our approach is novel in its focus on the interactive contribution of semantic, phonological, and orthographic processes. This perspective stems from evidence that literate adults have strongly established links among these three central language components, and the promotion of interactive processing of residual (and re-trained) skills in each domain can advance performance at multiple levels within the language system (sublexical, lexical, and sentence). We will examine a hierarchically structured treatment continuum where gaining mastery at a given level provides the scaffolding for advancing to the next level. A decision tree is proposed to guide the sequence for each individual in an algorithmic fashion. Using a case series approach, we propose to implement treatment with 50 individuals who reflect a diverse range of severity levels and behavioral and lesion profiles. Individual responses to treatment will be evaluated relative to performance on a comprehensive assessment of language before and after critical phases of treatment, allowing us to test the proposed algorithm. Language behavior and treatment outcomes will also be considered relative to the location and extent of brain damage affecting critical cortical networks. This work will advance the understanding of sequential treatment outcomes, and will serve to establish guidelines regarding treatment candidacy across the continuum. Ultimately, this study has the potential to change the way that clinicians plan treatment: shifting from the administration of isolated treatments to a planned sequence of interventions to maximize language recovery.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than 1 million Americans have persistent acquired language impairment due to brain damage. The rehabilitation of spoken and written language impairments is a high priority for affected individuals, and the quality and efficiency of treatment approaches are critical issues for patients, family members, speech-language pathologists, and third-party payers. The research proposed here has the potential to significantly impact the planning and implementation of behavioral treatment in a manner that maximizes recovery of function.

"Toward Individually-tailored Medicine: Probabilistic Models of Cerebral Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding, both from incidental discovery on imaging studies and on autopsy; it is estimated that anywhere from 1-6% of the American population will develop this problem. Unfortunately, while our ability to detect ICAs has grown, our fundamental understanding of this disease entity remains lacking and significant debate continues in regards to its treatment. Given the high degree of mortality and comorbidity associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, it is imperative that new insights and approaches be developed to inform medical decision making involving ICAs. Thus, the objective of this proposal is the creation of an informatics infrastructure to help elucidate the genesis, progression, and treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Building from our efforts from the previous R01, a set of technical developments is outlined to transform the array of information routinely collected from clinical as- sessment of ICA patients into a Bayesian belief network (BBN) that models the disease. First, we evolve the concept of a phenomenon-centric data model (PCDM) as the basis for (temporally) organizing clinically-derived observations, enabling the model to be associated with processing pipelines that can identify and transform targeted variables from the content of clinical data sources. Through these pipelines, specific values in free- text reports (radiology, surgery, pathology, discharge summaries) and imaging studies will be automatically extracted into a scientific-quality database. Second, the PCDM schema for ICAs is mapped to a Bayesian belief network: the linkage between the PCDM and BBN allows automatic updating of the network and its progressive refinement from a growing dataset. The BBN's topology will be determined by clinical experts and conditional probabilities computed from the extracted clinical data. A basic graphical user interface (GUI) will permit users to interact with the BBN, aiding in medical decision making tasks. The GUI will allow a clinician to pose questions from either a set of common clinical queries or to create new queries: loading a patient's medical record into this application will automatically populate BBN variables with extracted information (i.e., from the pipelines). Each technical component of this proposal will be evaluated in a laboratory setting. In addition, the BBN will be tested for its predictive capabilities and compared to other statistical models to assess its potential in guiding ICA treatment. This proposal leverages a clinical collaboration with the UCLA Division of Interventional Neuroradiology, a leader in ICA research and treatment. A combined dataset of 2,000 retrospective and prospective subjects will be used to create the ICA database and BBN. Data collection will encompass a comprehensive set of variables including clinical presentation, imaging assessment (morphology, hemodynamics), histopathology, gene expression, treatment, and outcomes. We will additionally leverage the NIH/NINDS Human Genetic DNA and Cell Line Repository for additional ICA-related data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies. The associated mortality rate and comorbidity resultant from ruptured ICAs are extreme: subarachnoid hemorrhage causes 50% of individuals to die within one month of rupture, and more than one third of survivors develop major neurological deficits. Hence, the focus of this re- search is the creation of a comprehensive research database for ICA patients, using the spectrum of data routinely acquired in the diagnosis and treatment of the problem; from this database, a new probabilistic model of ICAs will be created, providing new insights into the disease and its optimal treatment for a given individual.

"High-Throughput Computing for a Multi-Plan Framework in Radiotherapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Computerized planning for radiation delivery via either external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or intensity- modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) from linear accelerators is a complex process involving a large amount of input data and vast numbers of decision variables. Such large-scale combinatorial optimization problems are typically intractable for conventional approaches such as the direct application of the best available commercial algorithms, and thus specialized methods that take advantage of problem structure are required. Radiation treatment planning (RTP) problems are further complicated by the fact that they are multi-objective, that is, the RTP optimization process must take into account a trade-off between the competing goals of delivering appropriate doses to the tumor and avoiding the delivery of harmful radiation to nearby healthy organs. The goal of this proposal is to harness distributive computing via the Condor system for High Throughput Computing (HTC) within an RTP environment. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1) To develop a Nested Partitions (NP) framework that guides a global search process for optimal IMRT delivery parameters using HTC. 2) To develop parallel HTC-based linear programming (LP) methods to efficiently solve the dose optimization problem in IMRT for each given set of beam angles or beam apertures. (3) To exploit a high-throughput computing (HTC) environment and the developed NP/LP/segmentation framework to efficiently generate multiple plans for each given patient case. (4) To couple this multi-plan framework with a decision support system (DSS) that includes planning surface models, a graphical-user-interface (GUI) and machine learning tools to prediction OAR complication in order to aid in the ranking and selection of the generated treatment plans. This proposal requires a multi-disciplinary approach that is best conducted within the framework of the Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology program announcement. It brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in medical physics, mathematical programming, industrial engineering and clinical radiation oncology that is crucial to the development of the proposed multi- plan framework using HTC in radiation therapy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to develop a multi-dimensional platform for sophisticated treatment planning of radiation delivery.

"Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization for Rapid IMRT and VMAT Treatment Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has revolutionized the treatment of cancers in the last decade, since it can tightly conform and escalate radiation dose to a tumor while simultaneously protecting nearby radiation- sensitive normal tissues, resulting in better local control and fewer post-treatment complications than previous techniques. However, the process of obtaining a clinically acceptable IMRT plan for a difficult site is still extremely slow, requiring many hours of a busy expert's time in a manual trial-and-error loop of parameter adjustment. The goal of this project is to drastically reduce the amount of time to obtain a clinically acceptable IMRT plan using a new automated method that directly applies constrained optimization in a computationally tractable and clinically meaningful way. The hypothesis is that clinical treatment planning times using this technique will be reduced from several hours to a matter of minutes.  The new approach, called ROCO (Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization) translates well-established concepts from optimization and machine learning theory to the novel application of IMRT planning, exploiting the speed and ease of unconstrained optimizations and introducing a dimensionality reduction step that makes true constrained optimization tractable. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to (1) apply Reduced-Order Con- strained Optimization to IMRT planning for non-small cell lung cancers and nasopharynx cancers, where the planning process is highly time-consuming; (2) develop and extend the Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization paradigm to a promising IMRT variant called Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for the prostate site, which is currently nearly clinically intractable to plan; and (3) integrate the new tools into the clinical IMRT planning process at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, using a powered study to verify the hypothesis that the proposed method significantly improves planning speed. The experiments will be designed in consultation with an expert clinical treatment planner and biostatistician, and carefully validated using anonymized data from approximately 50 patients for each site.  The main benefit of the proposed approach is to drastically reduce planning times, which is critical if IMRT and VMAT are to reach their full potential in clinical application. In a busy clinic, long planning times place a severe stress on available resources, and can result in treatment delays, acceptance of sub-optimal plans or - in the worst case - errors due to time pressure. In the longer term, the proposed approach will provide deeper insight into the critical elements of the dose optimization problem, significantly reduce the trial-and-error effort characteristic of current IMRT planning, and reduce subjectivity in treatment plan selection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician. This proposal describes a new, automatic method for treatment plan optimization that is very fast, requiring only minutes to produce a plan that directly meets all the physician's constraints, potentially saving much time for a busy clinic.           Project Narrative Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician.

"Building a Risk Stratification Model for Treatment Resistance in Major Depressive    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One-third or more of individuals treated for major depressive disorder (MDD) do not experience remission of symptoms despite at least two adequate antidepressant trials. Such treatment-resistant depression (TRD) contributes disproportionately to the tremendous costs of MDD, in terms of health care costs, functional impairment, and diminished quality of life. The promise of personalized medicine for individuals at high risk for TRD is apparent. If these individuals could be recognized early in their disease course, they could be triaged to more intensive or targeted interventions to improve their likelihood of remission. For example, they might receive earlier addition of cognitive-behavioral therapy, earlier use of combination medication treatments, or earlier referral for electroconvulsive therapy. With the proliferation of treatment options in MDD, individuals can spend months or years in and out of treatment before receiving these next-step treatments. Moreover, the ability to identify these individuals would facilitate the development of new personalized interventions: rather than the requiring multiple failed prospective trials, high-risk individuals could immediately be offered study participation. At present, there are two primary obstacles to translating personalized medicine into clinical practice. First, no large and generalizable cohorts have been collected in which to build risk models. Second, no validation cohorts exist to demonstrate that such models perform well in clinical settings. The present study proposes to address these two obstacles directly. Previous investigations, including work in the large multicenter Systematic Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study, have identified putative clinical or genetic predictors of treatment response. However, in the absence of replication, such associations are hypothesis-generating at best. An ongoing study will collect data from 1,000 individuals treated in a New England health system for whom prospective treatment outcomes are available (the Dep1 cohort), including 500 individuals with TRD and 500 with SSRI-responsive MDD, with completion of a genome wide association study expected by spring 2009. The proposed study will first use cutting-edge modeling techniques to construct and cross-validate models of TRD using sociodemographic, clinical, and genetic predictors in the existing Dep1 cohort. In parallel, it will collect an additional 1,000 MDD subjects with 6-month treatment outcomes from the same health system. This second cohort (Dep2) will be used to validate the TRD risk stratification model. To identify these patient cohorts, this study will take advantage of computerized administrative data systems, data-mining, and natural language processing techniques that have been successfully applied to support population-based research. This approach allows identification of clinical features, such as comorbidities, medication treatments, as well as longitudinal outcomes, based on claims, pharmacy data, and medical records. The resulting patient data is far more representative of clinical populations, and far less expensive to generate, than that which could be obtained using more traditional approaches. Therefore, beyond facilitating personalized treatment of MDD, the proposed study would establish the methodology for using large clinical populations to personalize treatment in psychiatry as a whole.       Public Health Relevance: A third or more of people with major depression do not get well despite two or more different treatments, and identifying these people early in treatment might allow more personalized approaches with greater chances of success. This study will use statistical techniques to try to predict who is at risk for this treatment- resistant depression, based on clinical differences and genetic variations. Then, it will examine a second group of patients to see how well this technique might work if it is applied in a large health system.           Narrative A third or more of people with major depression do not get well despite two or more different treatments, and identifying these people early in treatment might allow more personalized approaches with greater chances of success.

"Biosignatures of Treatment Remission in Major Depression Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is associated with structural, functional, and neurochemical alterations in key interrelated brain circuits involved in emotion, reward, and executive functioning. Current models of its etiology, including genetic expression, gene environment interactions, the monoamine hypothesis, and neurogenesis guided our choice of biomarkers. We propose to use biomarkers from several levels of organization that address one or more of these models and examine their ability to predict treatment remission. At the genetic level, we will examine epigenetic measures and the transcriptome. At the molecular level, the utility of measures of 5HT1a neuroreceptor binding using Position Emission Tomography and proteomics will be investigated. At the anatomical level, we will examine white matter tract integrity and regional decreases in cortical thickness. Functional assessments include electroencephalography, loudness dependent auditory evoked potentials, and neurocognitive performance. Clinical features will be studied as well, e.g. presence of anxious depression, family history of depression, and others. While receiving supportive clinical management, 300 patients will be observed medication free for 3 weeks, to diminish the influence of placebo response and minimize effects on biosignature assays. Those still meeting criteria after the 3 weeks will receive all aforementioned assessments. Patients then will be randomized in a doublemasked fashion to bupropion or escitalopram, two of the most commonly prescribed treatments for depression, with putatively distinct mechanisms of action. Treatment will be for 12-14 weeks. Treatment outcome will be remission, measures of symptomatic improvement, and assessment of adverse events. Non-remitters will be crossed over. Outcomes will be measured with both traditional and contemporary clinical assessments. Patients will be followed for 6 months after randomization to assess maintenance of response and remission. We will also use a comprehensive analysis algorithm, using novel statistical techniques for high dimensional data to develop an optimal predictive model of treatment outcome that includes all data recorded from all modalities. The statistical team will develop new strategies to address the complex data set to be generated by this study. The resulting optimized algorithm for predicting remission can serve as the basis for a new study intended to validate this tool for personalized treatment of depression.

Unfortunately, the research efforts have been directed toward treatment approaches in isolation, and few, if any, researchers have considered the full scope and sequence of treatments necessary to maximize language recovery. In our current research, we tackled this issue with respect to the treatment of acquired agraphia, yielding evidence to support a treatment continuum for single-word writing. In the current proposal, we aim to build on the re-trained skills to maximize lexical retrieval in the spoken language modality, and to extend the treatment sequence to text-level reading and written composition. Our approach is novel in its focus on the interactive contribution of semantic, phonological, and orthographic processes. This perspective stems from evidence that literate adults have strongly established links among these three central language components, and the promotion of interactive processing of residual (and re-trained) skills in each domain can advance performance at multiple levels within the language system (sublexical, lexical, and sentence). We will examine a hierarchically structured treatment continuum where gaining mastery at a given level provides the scaffolding for advancing to the next level. A decision tree is proposed to guide the sequence for each individual in an algorithmic fashion. Using a case series approach, we propose to implement treatment with 50 individuals who reflect a diverse range of severity levels and behavioral and lesion profiles. Individual responses to treatment will be evaluated relative to performance on a comprehensive assessment of language before and after critical phases of treatment, allowing us to test the proposed algorithm. Language behavior and treatment outcomes will also be considered relative to the location and extent of brain damage affecting critical cortical networks. This work will advance the understanding of sequential treatment outcomes, and will serve to establish guidelines regarding treatment candidacy across the continuum. Ultimately, this study has the potential to change the way that clinicians plan treatment: shifting from the administration of isolated treatments to a planned sequence of interventions to maximize language recovery.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than 1 million Americans have persistent acquired language impairment due to brain damage. The rehabilitation of spoken and written language impairments is a high priority for affected individuals, and the quality and efficiency of treatment approaches are critical issues for patients, family members, speech-language pathologists, and third-party payers. The research proposed here has the potential to significantly impact the planning and implementation of behavioral treatment in a manner that maximizes recovery of function.           More than 1 million Americans have persistent acquired language impairment due to brain damage.

"High-Throughput Computing for a Multi-Plan Framework in Radiotherapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Computerized planning for radiation delivery via either external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or intensity- modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) from linear accelerators is a complex process involving a large amount of input data and vast numbers of decision variables. Such large-scale combinatorial optimization problems are typically intractable for conventional approaches such as the direct application of the best available commercial algorithms, and thus specialized methods that take advantage of problem structure are required. Radiation treatment planning (RTP) problems are further complicated by the fact that they are multi-objective, that is, the RTP optimization process must take into account a trade-off between the competing goals of delivering appropriate doses to the tumor and avoiding the delivery of harmful radiation to nearby healthy organs. The goal of this proposal is to harness distributive computing via the Condor system for High Throughput Computing (HTC) within an RTP environment. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1) To develop a Nested Partitions (NP) framework that guides a global search process for optimal IMRT delivery parameters using HTC. 2) To develop parallel HTC-based linear programming (LP) methods to efficiently solve the dose optimization problem in IMRT for each given set of beam angles or beam apertures. (3) To exploit a high-throughput computing (HTC) environment and the developed NP/LP/segmentation framework to efficiently generate multiple plans for each given patient case. (4) To couple this multi-plan framework with a decision support system (DSS) that includes planning surface models, a graphical-user-interface (GUI) and machine learning tools to prediction OAR complication in order to aid in the ranking and selection of the generated treatment plans. This proposal requires a multi-disciplinary approach that is best conducted within the framework of the Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology program announcement. It brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in medical physics, mathematical programming, industrial engineering and clinical radiation oncology that is crucial to the development of the proposed multi- plan framework using HTC in radiation therapy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to develop a multi-dimensional platform for sophisticated treatment planning of radiation delivery. It will develop novel algorithms that will enable generation of superior treatment plans with the added advantage of increasing the speed of treatment planning. Further, it will allow physicians to know beforehand the quality of the treatment plan relative to the multiple treatment objectives and be able to determine the treatment complication scenario beforehand.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a multi-dimensional platform for sophisticated treatment planning of radiation delivery.

"Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization for Rapid IMRT and VMAT Treatment Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has revolutionized the treatment of cancers in the last decade, since it can tightly conform and escalate radiation dose to a tumor while simultaneously protecting nearby radiation- sensitive normal tissues, resulting in better local control and fewer post-treatment complications than previous techniques. However, the process of obtaining a clinically acceptable IMRT plan for a difficult site is still extremely slow, requiring many hours of a busy expert's time in a manual trial-and-error loop of parameter adjustment. The goal of this project is to drastically reduce the amount of time to obtain a clinically acceptable IMRT plan using a new automated method that directly applies constrained optimization in a computationally tractable and clinically meaningful way. The hypothesis is that clinical treatment planning times using this technique will be reduced from several hours to a matter of minutes.  The new approach, called ROCO (Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization) translates well-established concepts from optimization and machine learning theory to the novel application of IMRT planning, exploiting the speed and ease of unconstrained optimizations and introducing a dimensionality reduction step that makes true constrained optimization tractable. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to (1) apply Reduced-Order Con- strained Optimization to IMRT planning for non-small cell lung cancers and nasopharynx cancers, where the planning process is highly time-consuming; (2) develop and extend the Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization paradigm to a promising IMRT variant called Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for the prostate site, which is currently nearly clinically intractable to plan; and (3) integrate the new tools into the clinical IMRT planning process at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, using a powered study to verify the hypothesis that the proposed method significantly improves planning speed. The experiments will be designed in consultation with an expert clinical treatment planner and biostatistician, and carefully validated using anonymized data from approximately 50 patients for each site.  The main benefit of the proposed approach is to drastically reduce planning times, which is critical if IMRT and VMAT are to reach their full potential in clinical application. In a busy clinic, long planning times place a severe stress on available resources, and can result in treatment delays, acceptance of sub-optimal plans or - in the worst case - errors due to time pressure. In the longer term, the proposed approach will provide deeper insight into the critical elements of the dose optimization problem, significantly reduce the trial-and-error effort characteristic of current IMRT planning, and reduce subjectivity in treatment plan selection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician. This proposal describes a new, automatic method for treatment plan optimization that is very fast, requiring only minutes to produce a plan that directly meets all the physician's constraints, potentially saving much time for a busy clinic.           Project Narrative Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician.

"Biomechanics and Correction of Crouch Gait The goal of this work is to establish a scientific basis for treating crouch gait, one of the most common movement abnormalities among children with cerebral palsy. Crouch gait is characterized by persistent flexion of the knee. It is an inefficient means of locomotion; if not corrected it often leads to bone deformities and serious, life-long physical limitations. We will develop predictive tools to determine the probability that each of the common treatments for crouch gait will improve a subject's excess knee flexion. For each treatment, we will identify a set of predictive variables. We will then identify all subjects from a large database of patients who received the surgery and use these subjects' outcome data to choose a weighting coefficient for each of the biomechanics based predictive variables. We will assess the predictive accuracy when applied to a different set of subjects using cross validation. These tools will predict whether or not a particular surgery will improve a patient's excessive knee flexion. Our preliminary work suggests that 80% prediction accuracy is feasible The success of this project will result in rigorously tested methods to aid treatment planning for crouch gait, and will hopefully produce better, more predictable treatment outcomes. Although multi-joint movement abnormalities such as crouch gait are exceptionally complex, the development of statistical models that predict which patients will benefit from specific surgical treatments is an important and necessary step toward designing more effective treatments.  PROJECT RELEVANCE  Crouch gait is one of the most common movement abnormalities among children with cerebral palsy. Surgeries are frequently performed in an effort to improve crouch gait, but it is difficult to predict which patients will benefit from these procedures because the biomechanical factors that cause crouch gait are unknown.

"Building a Risk Stratification Model for Treatment Resistance in Major Depressive    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One-third or more of individuals treated for major depressive disorder (MDD) do not experience remission of symptoms despite at least two adequate antidepressant trials. Such treatment-resistant depression (TRD) contributes disproportionately to the tremendous costs of MDD, in terms of health care costs, functional impairment, and diminished quality of life. The promise of personalized medicine for individuals at high risk for TRD is apparent. If these individuals could be recognized early in their disease course, they could be triaged to more intensive or targeted interventions to improve their likelihood of remission. For example, they might receive earlier addition of cognitive-behavioral therapy, earlier use of combination medication treatments, or earlier referral for electroconvulsive therapy. With the proliferation of treatment options in MDD, individuals can spend months or years in and out of treatment before receiving these next-step treatments. Moreover, the ability to identify these individuals would facilitate the development of new personalized interventions: rather than the requiring multiple failed prospective trials, high-risk individuals could immediately be offered study participation. At present, there are two primary obstacles to translating personalized medicine into clinical practice. First, no large and generalizable cohorts have been collected in which to build risk models. Second, no validation cohorts exist to demonstrate that such models perform well in clinical settings. The present study proposes to address these two obstacles directly. Previous investigations, including work in the large multicenter Systematic Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study, have identified putative clinical or genetic predictors of treatment response. However, in the absence of replication, such associations are hypothesis-generating at best. An ongoing study will collect data from 1,000 individuals treated in a New England health system for whom prospective treatment outcomes are available (the Dep1 cohort), including 500 individuals with TRD and 500 with SSRI-responsive MDD, with completion of a genome wide association study expected by spring 2009. The proposed study will first use cutting-edge modeling techniques to construct and cross-validate models of TRD using sociodemographic, clinical, and genetic predictors in the existing Dep1 cohort. In parallel, it will collect an additional 1,000 MDD subjects with 6-month treatment outcomes from the same health system. This second cohort (Dep2) will be used to validate the TRD risk stratification model. To identify these patient cohorts, this study will take advantage of computerized administrative data systems, data-mining, and natural language processing techniques that have been successfully applied to support population-based research. This approach allows identification of clinical features, such as comorbidities, medication treatments, as well as longitudinal outcomes, based on claims, pharmacy data, and medical records. The resulting patient data is far more representative of clinical populations, and far less expensive to generate, than that which could be obtained using more traditional approaches. Therefore, beyond facilitating personalized treatment of MDD, the proposed study would establish the methodology for using large clinical populations to personalize treatment in psychiatry as a whole.       Public Health Relevance: A third or more of people with major depression do not get well despite two or more different treatments, and identifying these people early in treatment might allow more personalized approaches with greater chances of success. This study will use statistical techniques to try to predict who is at risk for this treatment- resistant depression, based on clinical differences and genetic variations. Then, it will examine a second group of patients to see how well this technique might work if it is applied in a large health system.           Narrative A third or more of people with major depression do not get well despite two or more different treatments, and identifying these people early in treatment might allow more personalized approaches with greater chances of success.

"High-Throughput Computing for a Multi-Plan Framework in Radiotherapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Computerized planning for radiation delivery via either external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or intensity- modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) from linear accelerators is a complex process involving a large amount of input data and vast numbers of decision variables. Such large-scale combinatorial optimization problems are typically intractable for conventional approaches such as the direct application of the best available commercial algorithms, and thus specialized methods that take advantage of problem structure are required. Radiation treatment planning (RTP) problems are further complicated by the fact that they are multi-objective, that is, the RTP optimization process must take into account a trade-off between the competing goals of delivering appropriate doses to the tumor and avoiding the delivery of harmful radiation to nearby healthy organs. The goal of this proposal is to harness distributive computing via the Condor system for High Throughput Computing (HTC) within an RTP environment. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1) To develop a Nested Partitions (NP) framework that guides a global search process for optimal IMRT delivery parameters using HTC. 2) To develop parallel HTC-based linear programming (LP) methods to efficiently solve the dose optimization problem in IMRT for each given set of beam angles or beam apertures. (3) To exploit a high-throughput computing (HTC) environment and the developed NP/LP/segmentation framework to efficiently generate multiple plans for each given patient case. (4) To couple this multi-plan framework with a decision support system (DSS) that includes planning surface models, a graphical-user-interface (GUI) and machine learning tools to prediction OAR complication in order to aid in the ranking and selection of the generated treatment plans. This proposal requires a multi-disciplinary approach that is best conducted within the framework of the Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology program announcement. It brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in medical physics, mathematical programming, industrial engineering and clinical radiation oncology that is crucial to the development of the proposed multi- plan framework using HTC in radiation therapy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to develop a multi-dimensional platform for sophisticated treatment planning of radiation delivery. It will develop novel algorithms that will enable generation of superior treatment plans with the added advantage of increasing the speed of treatment planning. Further, it will allow physicians to know beforehand the quality of the treatment plan relative to the multiple treatment objectives and be able to determine the treatment complication scenario beforehand.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a multi-dimensional platform for sophisticated treatment planning of radiation delivery.

"Biomechanics and Correction of Crouch Gait The goal of this work is to establish a scientific basis for treating crouch gait, one of the most common movement abnormalities among children with cerebral palsy. Crouch gait is characterized by persistent flexion of the knee. It is an inefficient means of locomotion; if not corrected it often leads to bone deformities and serious, life-long physical limitations. We will develop predictive tools to determine the probability that each of the common treatments for crouch gait will improve a subject's excess knee flexion. For each treatment, we will identify a set of predictive variables. We will then identify all subjects from a large database of patients who received the surgery and use these subjects' outcome data to choose a weighting coefficient for each of the biomechanics based predictive variables. We will assess the predictive accuracy when applied to a different set of subjects using cross validation. These tools will predict whether or not a particular surgery will improve a patient's excessive knee flexion. Our preliminary work suggests that 80% prediction accuracy is feasible The success of this project will result in rigorously tested methods to aid treatment planning for crouch gait, and will hopefully produce better, more predictable treatment outcomes. Although multi-joint movement abnormalities such as crouch gait are exceptionally complex, the development of statistical models that predict which patients will benefit from specific surgical treatments is an important and necessary step toward designing more effective treatments. The positive economic impact of this project is to maintain employment for the project participants. We have already lost one talented bioengineer, F.E. Anderson, because of the funding gap in this project arising from severe NIH paylines. Funding for this project will provide employment for Ajay Seth, Carolyn Mazenko, and Jennifer Hicks for the next two years.",Biomechanics and Correction of Crouch Gait,7735516,R01HD033929,"['Aftercare', 'Arthralgia', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Employment', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'common treatment', 'crouch gait', 'design', 'economic impact', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'response', 'simulation', 'sound', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,390557,0.01028600757004284
"Building a Risk Stratification Model for Treatment Resistance in Major Depressive    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One-third or more of individuals treated for major depressive disorder (MDD) do not experience remission of symptoms despite at least two adequate antidepressant trials. Such treatment-resistant depression (TRD) contributes disproportionately to the tremendous costs of MDD, in terms of health care costs, functional impairment, and diminished quality of life. The promise of personalized medicine for individuals at high risk for TRD is apparent. If these individuals could be recognized early in their disease course, they could be triaged to more intensive or targeted interventions to improve their likelihood of remission. For example, they might receive earlier addition of cognitive-behavioral therapy, earlier use of combination medication treatments, or earlier referral for electroconvulsive therapy. With the proliferation of treatment options in MDD, individuals can spend months or years in and out of treatment before receiving these next-step treatments. Moreover, the ability to identify these individuals would facilitate the development of new personalized interventions: rather than the requiring multiple failed prospective trials, high-risk individuals could immediately be offered study participation. At present, there are two primary obstacles to translating personalized medicine into clinical practice. First, no large and generalizable cohorts have been collected in which to build risk models. Second, no validation cohorts exist to demonstrate that such models perform well in clinical settings. The present study proposes to address these two obstacles directly. Previous investigations, including work in the large multicenter Systematic Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study, have identified putative clinical or genetic predictors of treatment response. However, in the absence of replication, such associations are hypothesis-generating at best. An ongoing study will collect data from 1,000 individuals treated in a New England health system for whom prospective treatment outcomes are available (the Dep1 cohort), including 500 individuals with TRD and 500 with SSRI-responsive MDD, with completion of a genome wide association study expected by spring 2009. The proposed study will first use cutting-edge modeling techniques to construct and cross-validate models of TRD using sociodemographic, clinical, and genetic predictors in the existing Dep1 cohort. In parallel, it will collect an additional 1,000 MDD subjects with 6-month treatment outcomes from the same health system. This second cohort (Dep2) will be used to validate the TRD risk stratification model. To identify these patient cohorts, this study will take advantage of computerized administrative data systems, data-mining, and natural language processing techniques that have been successfully applied to support population-based research. This approach allows identification of clinical features, such as comorbidities, medication treatments, as well as longitudinal outcomes, based on claims, pharmacy data, and medical records. The resulting patient data is far more representative of clinical populations, and far less expensive to generate, than that which could be obtained using more traditional approaches. Therefore, beyond facilitating personalized treatment of MDD, the proposed study would establish the methodology for using large clinical populations to personalize treatment in psychiatry as a whole.       Public Health Relevance: A third or more of people with major depression do not get well despite two or more different treatments, and identifying these people early in treatment might allow more personalized approaches with greater chances of success. This study will use statistical techniques to try to predict who is at risk for this treatment- resistant depression, based on clinical differences and genetic variations. Then, it will examine a second group of patients to see how well this technique might work if it is applied in a large health system.           Narrative A third or more of people with major depression do not get well despite two or more different treatments, and identifying these people early in treatment might allow more personalized approaches with greater chances of success.

"Toward Individually-tailored Medicine: Probabilistic Models of Cerebral Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding, both from incidental discovery on imaging studies and on autopsy; it is estimated that anywhere from 1-6% of the American population will develop this problem. Unfortunately, while our ability to detect ICAs has grown, our fundamental understanding of this disease entity remains lacking and significant debate continues in regards to its treatment. Given the high degree of mortality and comorbidity associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, it is imperative that new insights and approaches be developed to inform medical decision making involving ICAs. Thus, the objective of this proposal is the creation of an informatics infrastructure to help elucidate the genesis, progression, and treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Building from our efforts from the previous R01, a set of technical developments is outlined to transform the array of information routinely collected from clinical as- sessment of ICA patients into a Bayesian belief network (BBN) that models the disease. First, we evolve the concept of a phenomenon-centric data model (PCDM) as the basis for (temporally) organizing clinically-derived observations, enabling the model to be associated with processing pipelines that can identify and transform targeted variables from the content of clinical data sources. Through these pipelines, specific values in free- text reports (radiology, surgery, pathology, discharge summaries) and imaging studies will be automatically extracted into a scientific-quality database. Second, the PCDM schema for ICAs is mapped to a Bayesian belief network: the linkage between the PCDM and BBN allows automatic updating of the network and its progressive refinement from a growing dataset. The BBN's topology will be determined by clinical experts and conditional probabilities computed from the extracted clinical data. A basic graphical user interface (GUI) will permit users to interact with the BBN, aiding in medical decision making tasks. The GUI will allow a clinician to pose questions from either a set of common clinical queries or to create new queries: loading a patient's medical record into this application will automatically populate BBN variables with extracted information (i.e., from the pipelines). Each technical component of this proposal will be evaluated in a laboratory setting. In addition, the BBN will be tested for its predictive capabilities and compared to other statistical models to assess its potential in guiding ICA treatment. This proposal leverages a clinical collaboration with the UCLA Division of Interventional Neuroradiology, a leader in ICA research and treatment. A combined dataset of 2,000 retrospective and prospective subjects will be used to create the ICA database and BBN. Data collection will encompass a comprehensive set of variables including clinical presentation, imaging assessment (morphology, hemodynamics), histopathology, gene expression, treatment, and outcomes. We will additionally leverage the NIH/NINDS Human Genetic DNA and Cell Line Repository for additional ICA-related data.

"Generalization of the Client Matching Protocol    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This proposal tests the generalization of a standardized client-treatment matching interview and decision-tree algorithm (the Client Matching Protocol, or CMP) through an 18-month secondary analysis of the Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Study (DATOS) database. The investigative team's previous study of Therapeutic Community (TC)-oriented agencies found that clients entering outpatient and residential treatment settings in which there was a concordance with the CMP algorithm (matched clients) showed significantly higher rates of treatment completion and long-term retention than clients entering settings that were discordant with the CMP algorithm (mismatched clients). The present study uses the DATOS variables to recreate the CMP algorithm. The study extends the previous research by 1) testing the generalization of the CMP to non-TC residential and outpatient programs, 2) determining the effect of matching on treatment process, and 3) testing the generalization of the matching effect to one- and five-year treatment outcomes. Additional research questions explore the extension of the CMP algorithm to short-term residential and methadone outpatient treatment, and to the interaction between the CMP match and organizational and client variables. Non-parametric statistics, ANOVA, logistic and multiple regression, and Structural Equation Modeling test the effects of matching and the interaction of matching and the program and client characteristics. The present study contains important research and clinical implications. This 18-month study contains significant implications for both treatment and research in that it will provide empirical clarification of whether and how matching contributes to treatment improvement.

"Expert System Intervention--Domestic Violence Offenders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Male-to-female partner violence poses a major threat to the physical and emotional well being of women. Research assessing the efficacy of court-mandated domestic violence treatment programs has yielded disappointing results. A major problem with mandated treatment is that it tends to be standardized and 'one-size-fits-all,' neglecting individual differences in motivation level and readiness to change. We propose to individualize services by developing and testing a Transtheoretical Model (TTM) based intervention tailored to individual stage of readiness to end the violence. In Phase I the objective was to develop a stage-based computer-administered multimedia expert system intervention and self-help manual designed to be administered as an adjunct to traditional batterer treatment. In Phase II, the objective is to complete development of the intervention materials, translate them into Spanish, and assess their efficacy in a randomized clinical trial. English- and Spanish-speaking domestic violence treatment clients will be randomly assigned at treatment intake to the experimental (n=350) or control condition (n=350).

"Expert System Intervention--Domestic Violence Offenders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Male-to-female partner violence poses a major threat to the physical and emotional well being of women. Research assessing the efficacy of court-mandated domestic violence treatment programs has yielded disappointing results. A major problem with mandated treatment is that it tends to be standardized and 'one-size-fits-all,' neglecting individual differences in motivation level and readiness to change. We propose to individualize services by developing and testing a Transtheoretical Model (TTM) based intervention tailored to individual stage of readiness to end the violence. In Phase I the objective was to develop a stage-based computer-administered multimedia expert system intervention and self-help manual designed to be administered as an adjunct to traditional batterer treatment. In Phase II, the objective is to complete development of the intervention materials, translate them into Spanish, and assess their efficacy in a randomized clinical trial. English- and Spanish-speaking domestic violence treatment clients will be randomly assigned at treatment intake to the experimental (n=350) or control condition (n=350). Efficacy will be assessed by comparing the intervention and control groups on number of batterer treatment sessions attended, partner reports of recidivism, re-arrests for domestic assault, and several secondary outcome measures. n/a",Expert System Intervention--Domestic Violence Offenders,6485358,R44MH062858,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavior therapy', ' clinical research', ' clinical trials', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' domestic violence', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' male', ' motivation', ' psychological models', ' spouse abuse']",NIMH,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2002,383964,0.04424638092729132

"TOPIC 389 - INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING Besides surgery, radiotherapy is the most effective treatment modality for localized prostate cancer. The success of radiotherapy stems from the exploit of a therapeutic window in tumor response and normal tissue tolerance which maximizes the chance of sterilizing the tumor while sparing the surrounding normal tissue from severe damage. This requires an accurate and individualized radiation dose distribution generated from the examination of the patient’s medical images. Radiation therapy is technically complex and labor intensive. Intensive human supervision and intervention are needed throughout the path of patient care.   Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are adept at automating workflows and tasks—in this case the development of cancer treatment plans. We believe that this machine learning has incredible potential to address inherent problems in the existing treatment planning workflow. Our approach will mitigate the current issues with treatment planning, integrate seamlessly with day-to-day operations, and will serve as a treatment solution that benefits patients in a way that limits their risk and extends their lives.   The goal of this project is to develop a start-to-end prostate cancer treatment planning system. We will work with three expert radiation oncology teams to archive existing patient data for use in training of artificial intelligence algorithms. These algorithms will enable high quality plans to be generated with ease. At the completion of Phase I, we will have a prototype interface that will allow users to create treatment plans and segmentation using artificial intelligence algorithms.

"Automatic Organ Segmentation Tool for Radiation Treatment Planning of Cancers ABSTRACT As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention, which is critical in reducing long term toxicity of cancers. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to organs-at-risk (OARs), OARs need to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans during radiation treatment planning to get an accurate dose distribution. Despite tremendous effort in developing semi- or fully-automatic segmentation solutions, current automated segmentation software, mostly using the atlas-based methods, has not yet reached the level of accuracy and robustness required for clinical usage. Therefore, in current practice, significant manual efforts are still required in the OAR segmentation process. Manual contouring suffers from inter- and intra-observer variability, as well as institutional variability where different sites adopt distinct contouring atlases and labeling criteria, thus leading to inaccuracy and variability in OAR segmentation. When OARs are very close to the treatment target, segmentation errors as small as a few millimeters can have a statistically significant impact on dosimetry distribution and outcome. In addition, it is also costly and time consuming as it can take 1-2 hours of a clinicians’ time to segment major thoracic organs due to the large number of axial slices required. In summary, an accurate and fast process for segmenting OARs in treatment planning using CT scans is needed for improving patient outcomes and reducing the cost of radiation therapy of cancers. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning methods has revolutionized many computer-vision areas and the adoption of deep learning in medical applications has shown great success. Based on a deep-learning-based algorithm we developed that achieved better-than-human performance and ranked 1st in 2017 American Association of Physicist in Medicine Thoracic Auto-segmentation Challenge, an automatic OAR segmentation product will be developed in this project with the three aims: 1) further improve the performance and robustness of OAR segmentation algorithms, focusing on addressing the heterogeneity issue of different clinical environments; 2) further enrich the functionalities and enhance usability of the cloud- based software product; and 3) perform clinical validation study on the algorithm performance and software usability at collaborating sites. With this product, the segmentation accuracy can be improved, leading to more robust treatment plans in protecting normal organs and improved long term patient outcome. The time and cost of radiation treatment planning can be greatly reduced, contributing to a more affordable cancer treatment and reduced healthcare burden. NARRATIVE As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to such organs-at-risk (OARs), they are required to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans.

"A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort Post-resection prognostication for oral cavity cancers (OCC) is qualitative and potentially ambiguous. A significant subset (25-37%) of Stage I/II patients still develop local recurrence after treatment with surgery alone. The long-term goal of this proposal will be to create a Quantitative Risk Model (QRM) using machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II patients using image-based biomarkers of aggression. The objective is to develop and validate state-of-the-art systems for biomarker imaging, quantification, and modeling to accurately predict risk of recurrence in cancer patients based on image analytics. The central hypothesis is that a quantitative, artificial intelligence approach to pathology will result in significantly greater prognostic value compared with manual microscope-based analysis. The rationale for this work is that tumor aggression can be predicted from patterns present in pathology images, given the existence of histological risk models that have been clinically validated in the past; however, these risk models are not in widespread use because they are less accurate, robust, and transportable to the larger community of pathologists. This proposal will test the central hypothesis through three specific aims: (1) Develop an analysis pipeline that can accurately predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II OCC patients and identify treatment targets (e.g. adaptive local immune response and angiogenesis); (2) Demonstrate robust performance across a multi-site data cohort collected from seven national and international centers; and (3) Distil the results of QRM analysis to synoptic pathology reporting, demonstrating the ability of QRM to interface with standard clinical reporting tools. The innovation for addressing these aims comes from a unique application of active learning for training artificial intelligence to recognize tissue structures, new features for quantifying tissue architecture based on the interface between tumor and host, and a novel approach for large cross-site validation. Moreover, this proposal develops a unique mapping between computational pathology and commonly-used synoptic reporting variables, enabling rapid uptake of this work into existing clinical workflows. This research is significant because it provides personalized outcome predictions for a niche group of undertreated patients with limited options and can serve as the foundation for designing future clinical trials through identification of treatment targets. Multi-site training and evaluation, combined with AI-to-report mapping, will be broadly applicable to a large group of computational approaches, bridging the gap between engineering research labs and clinical application. The expected outcome of this work is a trained model for predicting Stage I/II OCC recurrence, identification of treatment targets, and mapping to synoptic reports, as well as a broadly-applicable workflow for the broader computational pathology community. This project will have a large positive impact on patients and surgical pathologists by enabling rapid, accurate prognosis and directed treatment plans in an easy-to-use pipeline that integrates seamlessly into existing clinical workflows. We aim to develop a quantitative risk model for oral cavity cancer patients, 25-37% of whom will experience debilitating post-treatment recurrence. Using state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, we will develop and validate our risk model on a large multi-site cohort of patients, and develop an AI-assisted synoptic report-filling tool for integrating into clinical practice.

"Characterizing and targeting subphenotypes of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder via individually imputed tissue and cell-type specific transcriptomes PROJECT SUMMARY  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are highly heritable, severe and complex brain disorders characterized by substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity. Despite this, case-control studies often ignore such heterogeneity through their focus on the average patient, which may be the core reason for a lack of robust biomarkers indicative of an individual’s treatment response and outcome. Although they are classified as independent diagnostic entities, SCZ and BD are highly genetically correlated, exhibit high relative risks among relatives of both BD & SCZ patients, and have partially overlapping symptomatology and treatment. In this project we will use tissue and cell-type specific imputed transcriptomes for individuals with SCZ or BD in our VA discovery cohort comprising the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and Cooperative Studies Program 572 (CSP #572, “The Genetics of Functional Disability in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Illness”), as an intermediate molecular phenotype, to identify, characterize and target subphenotypes of these disorders. Findings from the VA discovery cohort will be validated in the PsycheMERGE and BioMe cohorts.  First, we will impute tissue and cell-type specific transcriptomes for all individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ) or bipolar disorder (BD) in the VA discovery cohort. To achieve this, we will train tissue (brain and peripheral tissues) and cell-type (glutamatergic & GABAergic neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia from DLPFC) specific EpiXcan transcriptomic imputation models at the gene and isoform level. Secondly, we will use the imputed transcriptomes as an intermediate molecular phenotype to identify genetically-regulated gene expression (GReX) based subpopulations and within them the key molecular drivers using deep neural networks (DNNs). Lastly, we will identify key non-genetic biomarkers and effective treatments for each validated subphenotype. Non-genetic biomarkers will be based on pre-mined features available from the electronic health records (EHR) and features extracted from the EHR via natural language processing (NLP). The subphenotypes will be validated in the civilian cohorts PsycheMERGE and BioMe.  This project will take place at the Icahn School of Medicine, one of the leading centers of data science, genomics and precision medicine. The mentoring committee comprises experts in the fields of computational and functional genomics, integrative analysis, machine learning (including DNNs and NLP), and EHR mining. Dr. Voloudakis will develop the skills necessary to launch an independent academic career in genetically based EHR-informed precision psychiatry.

"Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY About 2/3 of cancer patients in US receive radiation therapy either alone or in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc. Treatment planning, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, is analogous to the design of a blueprint for building construction. If a treatment plan is poorly designed, the desired treatment outcome cannot be achieved, no matter how well other components of radiation therapy are performed. In the current clinical workflow, a treatment planner works towards a good quality plan in a trial-and-error fashion. Many rounds of consultation between the planner and physician are needed to reach a plan of physician's satisfaction, because physician's preference for a particular patient can hardly be quantified and precisely conveyed to the planner. Consequently, planning time can be up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor and can vary significantly due to varying levels of physician and planner's skills and physician-planner cooperation, etc., which substantially deteriorates treatment outcomes. For example, head and neck (H&N) cancer patients treated with suboptimal plans present 20% lower 2-year overall survival and 24% higher 2-year local-regional failure. Prolonged overall treatment process due to treatment planning reduces local-regional control rate by 12–14% per week. Furthermore, as patient's anatomy can rapidly change within the planning time, the optimally designed plan becomes inappropriate for the changed anatomy. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has made colossal advancements. We believe that AI technologies have a great potential to revolutionize treatment planning. Treatment planning consists of two major aspects: commonality and individuality. By exploiting the commonality through deep supervised learning, we can develop a treatment plan as good as those for previously treated similar patients. The individuality can be actualized by learning physician's special considerations for a particular patient using deep reinforcement learning. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated feasibility of these ideas. We hypothesize that an AI-based intelligent treatment planning system can consistently produce high-quality treatment plans with extremely high efficiency. This hypothesis will be tested using H&N cancer patients as a test bed via two aims. Aim 1, System development. Develop two deep-learning models to realize the proposed treatment planning workflow and incorporate them into a clinical environment. Aim 2, System validation. Acquire and analyze planning data before and after system implementation. The innovation of this project is the use and customization of the state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve a clinically important problem. These technologies would revolutionize treatment planning process, leading to the efficient generation of consistently high quality plans, irrespective of human skills, experiences, and communications, etc. Besides the significance demonstrated for the H&N cancer patients, the system can be easily extended to other tumor sites, yielding more substantial impacts. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal and varying quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes.

"SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics  The current best practice guidelines for treating depression call for close monitoring of patients, and periodically adjusting treatment as needed. This project will advance personalized depression treatment by developing an innovative system, DepWatch, that leverages mobile health technologies and machine learning tools to provide clinicians objective, accurate, and timely assessment of depression symptoms to assist with their clinical decision making process. Specifically, DepWatch collects sensory data passively from smartphones and wristbands, without any user interaction, and uses simple user-friendly interfaces to collect ecological momentary assessments (EMA), medication adherence and safety related data from patients. The collected data will be fed to machine learning models to be developed in the project to provide weekly assessment of patient symptom levels and predict the trajectory of treatment response over time. The assessment and prediction results are then presented using a graphic interface to clinicians to help them make critical treatment decisions. Our project comprises two studies. Phase I collects sensory data and other data (e.g., clinical data, EMA, tolerability and safety data) from 250 adult participants with unstable depression symptomatology. The data thus collected will be used to develop and validate assessment and prediction models, which will be incorporated into DepWatch system. In Phase II, three clinicians will use DepWatch to support their clinical decision making process; a total of 50 participants under treatment by the three participating clinicians will be recruited for the study. A number of innovative machine learning techniques will be developed. These include a set of new learning formulations to construct matrix-based longitudinal predictive models, and determine the temporal contingency and the most influential features, and deep learning based data imputation methods that can handle both problems of sporadic missing data as well as missing data in an entire view. In addition, multi-task feature learning models and feature selection techniques will be expanded and refined for this challenging setting of large-scale heterogeneous data. The project is highly relevant to public and global health because it will provide a significant step forward in providing effective and patient-centric care in treating depression. It will help personalize depression treatment by identifying patients who are failing treatments early and will assist providers to take necessary actions before patients drop out of treatment.",SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics ,9980496,R01MH119678,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Drops', 'Early treatment', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Family', 'Formulation', 'Health Technology', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Sensory', 'Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'data de-identification', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'feature selection', 'global health', 'heterogenous data', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'medication safety', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2020,270271,0.04669904470650621
"SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea  The ability to rapidly match the right patients to the right treatments at the right time is critical to ensuring patients  receive high quality care. The vast majority of machine learning applications in healthcare focus on diagnosing or  stratifying patients for a particular outcome. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn how clinical states  (i.e., sets of signs, symptoms, and test results) respond to specific sequences of treatments, with the goal of optimizing clinical outcomes. RL does not aim to diagnose, but infers diagnosis based on a patient's response to  specific treatments--in many ways mimicking how clinicians operate in practice. This proposal will develop a novel  clinician-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (RL) framework that analyzes electronic health record (EHR) clinical time-series data to support physician decision making, iteratively providing physicians the estimated outcome of  potential treatment strategies. Our topic of focus for this work is the evaluation and treatment of patients hospitalized with acute dyspnea (shortness of breath) and signs of impending respiratory failure. Acute dyspnea is an ideal condition for an RL approach, since it can be due to three overlapping conditions: congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Determining optimal treatment for these patients is clinically difficult, as a patient's presentation is frequently ambiguous, rapidly changing, and often due to multiple causes.  Inappropriate treatment may occur in up to a third of patients leading to increased mortality. While developing this  RL framework, we will also develop methods to learn more useful representations of high-dimensional clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training. In addition, given the challenges of working with observational health data, we will develop new methods for evaluation of learned policies and develop new theory to better understand the limitations of RL using observational data. The project has four aims: 1) create a shareable, de-identified EHR time-series dataset of 35,000 patients with acute dyspnea, 2) develop techniques for exploiting invariances In tasks involving clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training, 3) develop and evaluate an RL-based framework for learning optimal treatment policies for acute dyspnea, and 4) prospectively validate the learned treatment model. This research will result in new techniques for learning representations from time-series data and will study both the theoretical and practical limitations of RL using observational clinical data, leading to key advancements in ML and RL for clinical care. The tools developed for clinical decision support in this proposal have the potential for high impact because of their ability to generalize beyond the problem studied here to other conditions, laying the groundwork for clinical systems that directly impact society by aiding in the timely and appropriate treatment of patients. Hospitalization for sudden and severe shortness of breath (acute dyspnea) affects almost 2 million patients in the US each  year.

"Using Causal Inference and Machine Learning Methods to Predict Cognitive Behavioral Treatment Response PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many patients with anxiety and fear disorders (AFDs) report minimal benefits when treated with an evidence- based psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]) or pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants; benzodiazepines). Conversely, some AFD patients are likely to benefit from virtually any treatment (e.g., supportive therapy). Using data collected in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), there has been limited progress determining how to use pre-treatment characteristics to match AFD patients to the treatment that is most likely to provide benefit. As a result, NIMH has forwarded Strategic Objectives focused on identifying treatment moderators and developing tools that predict differential treatment response. The broad goal of this proposed secondary data analysis is to apply causal inference and machine learning methods to prospective observational data to predict differential treatment response among patients with AFDs. The sample (n = 1,528) is from a longstanding NIMH-funded study of AFD patients who received: (a) CBT with concurrent pharmacotherapy, (b) CBT without pharmacotherapy, or (c) treatment as usual (TAU). Targeted maximum likelihood estimation (a causal inference method) and super learning (an ensemble machine learning method) will be used to accomplish the proposed Aims. Aim 1 will estimate the (overall) average effects of the three treatment types. Aim 2 will estimate “optimal treatment rules” to determine if differential treatment response can be meaningfully predicted based on a patient's multidimensional profile of pre-treatment symptoms. Aim 3 will estimate “optimal treatment rules” to determine if differential treatment response can be meaningfully predicted using all available pre-treatment covariates. The proposed study is highly innovative and could significantly impact the growing literature focused on predicting differential treatment effects and personalizing treatment for patients with AFDs. Although treatment effects estimates obtained using observational data and causal inference methods (i.e., adjusted for nonrandom treatment selection) are similar to those estimated in RCTs, this would be the first study to apply such methods to AFD patient data. This study will also be the first to use ensemble machine learning to develop composite moderators for AFDs (i.e., optimal treatment rules). In comparison, prior attempts to develop composite moderators have relied on less flexible model-building procedures prone to overfitting and unable to capture complex predictor-outcome associations (e.g., interactions among predictors; nonlinear associations). In achieving the proposed Aims, the current study would be a catalyst for future research using causal inference and machine learning to study predictors of differential treatment response among AFD patients. Results will be used to justify future research aimed at expanding and validating the models in larger observational samples and pragmatic RCTs (e.g., optimal treatment rules for specific medications/doses; timing of pharmacotherapy relative to CBT; second-wave CBT versus acceptance-based CBT). PROJECT NARRATIVE Some patients with anxiety and fear disorders may benefit only from certain evidence-based treatments, while others may benefit from virtually any treatment (e.g., talk therapy). The current study will use casual inference and machine learning methods to develop predictive models that identify the treatment(s) most likely to benefit a particular patient. The models developed in this study will serve as an important initial step toward efficient and personalized treatment for patients with anxiety and fear disorders.",Using Causal Inference and Machine Learning Methods to Predict Cognitive Behavioral Treatment Response,9912204,R21MH119492,"['Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Assessment tool', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life Stress', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Onset of illness', 'Outpatients', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Procedures', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Severities', 'Supportive care', 'Symptoms', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'anxiety treatment', 'base', 'catalyst', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'excessive anxiety', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'model building', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'sociodemographics', 'stress reactivity', 'symptom treatment', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment disparity', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'virtual']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2020,207977,0.08431550559889499
"Validating of Machine Learning-Based EEG Treatment Biomarkers in Depression SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overarching aim of Alto Neuroscience is to advance brain-based biomarkers for psychiatric disorders in order to both optimize treatment pathways and drive the development of novel pharmacological and non- pharmacological interventions. Alto does this by developing and applying sophisticated machine learning computational models to electroencephalography (EEG) data collected at scale in real-world clinical treatment contexts. Specifically, in this direct-to-phase II SBIR proposal we will refine, and then independently validate, two EEG-based candidate biomarkers we have identified for stratifying patients with depression in a manner that both factors biological heterogeneity and informs treatment response. One of our biomarkers was derived in a “top-down” (i.e. supervised) manner by trying to directly predict treatment outcome, while the other biomarker presents a complimentary “bottom-up” (i.e. unsupervised) approach that begins by first identifying the most biologically homogeneous subset of patients and then testing the treatment relevance of the subtyping. Together, these findings represent very robust individual patient-level treatment-relevant EEG biomarkers, and in both cases, help define a critically-important objective approach to prospectively identifying and treating treatment- resistant depressed patients. A successful outcome of the proposed work would yield the first FDA-cleared biomarkers for stratifying psychiatric conditions. It would also provide a basis for targeted development of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions based on the EEG biomarkers. Both outcomes hold substantial commercial value and exciting potential for transforming psychiatry.

"An artificial intelligence-driven distributed stereotactic radiosurgery strategy for multiple brain metastases management PROJECT SUMMARY Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive decline and design strategies to preserve patients’ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care. To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI- based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality, patients’ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow. In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The project’s innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI tools’ performance through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with multiple brain metastases, a cancer which has spread to multiple places in the brain, have poor survival or quality of life after single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy. We will develop and study a new treatment strategy for multiple brain metastases using spatial and temporal fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery by frameless GammaKnife.

"Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Anxiety disorders in youth are highly prevalent [1] and impairing [2-4]. Left untreated, these disorders confer substantial additional risk for the development of a wide range of negative sequelae, including substance use [5], suicidal ideation and attempts [6], and additional mental health comorbidities [7]. Although several treatments have demonstrated efficacy for anxiety in youth, including individual cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT), family CBT (FCBT), medication (MED), and combination of CBT and medication (COMB) [8], a meaningful portion of youth are classified as non-responders after a full course of treatment [9]. The identification of baseline predictors and moderators of response is critical to improve treatment efficacy and reduce burden on families. Increased anxiety severity, comorbidity (behavioral problems, depression), and family psychopathology, along with older age, female gender and anxiety diagnosis, have been highlighted as potential predictors and moderators of outcome. However, studies have been underpowered and findings are inconsistent [10]. To date, all studies have taken a traditional analytic approach, which typically provides conservative estimates as a result of imposed explanatory constraints [11]. Machine Learning (ML) represents a promising complementary statistical technique to traditional analyses, given its focus on predictive fit rather than explanatory inference [12] and will facilitate identification of non-linear, complex patterns of predictors and moderators at the individual level [13, 14]. These methods have shown promise in identification of treatment outcome predictors in other medical [e.g., 15-18] and psychiatric samples [e.g., 19-22], but to date have not been implemented in a sample of anxious youth. The proposed project will aggregate datasets from at minimum ten peer-reviewed and published randomized controlled trials (N=1444) and train and validate two models along overlapping features, including (1) demographics, (2) diagnosis, (3) anxiety severity (4) behavioral problems, and (5) family psychopathology. Models will also be used to examine differential response to ICBT, FCBT, MED and COMB. Aggregated data will be uploaded into a centralized dataset, in line with the NIMH RDoC db and NDAR [23] datasets, and then used to predict outcome for individual anxious youth (N=80) completing ICBT and COMB at the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple. The aims of this study are consistent with calls issued in the NIMH strategic plan (Objective 3) and will help facilitate the development of person-centered interventions for anxious youth [24]. An individualized approach to treatment is important to further increase treatment efficacy and reduce the financial and emotional burden associated with non-response [25, 26]. A training plan has been designed that consists of mentorship, formal classwork and experiential learning to develop the applicant's expertise in machine learning and dataset aggregation. The proposed study will take place within Temple University's clinical psychology program, which has a successful track record of conducting impactful NIMH-funded research and training research scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although several efficacious treatments have been identified for youth anxiety, there is significant heterogeneity in treatment response and this heterogeneity is poorly understood. To help clarify differences in treatment response and facilitate the development of person-centered interventions, novel and advanced statistical approaches should be implemented using adequately powered datasets. The proposed study will (1) use machine-learning methods to identify predictors and moderators of outcome in an aggregated dataset of at minimum ten Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) examining youth anxiety treatments (individual and family cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, and combination treatments), (2) create a centralized dataset of aggregated RCTs to foster continued cross-site collaboration and (3) test the model's predictive accuracy at the individual level in a real-world sample.",Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth,9990935,F31MH123038,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology)', 'Emotional', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Youth', 'active method', 'anxiety treatment', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'childhood anxiety', 'clinical decision-making', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'demographics', 'depression model', 'design', 'expectation', 'family burden', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individual variation', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'parental role', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response', 'social anxiety', 'treatment response']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,F31,2020,33509,-0.005980483100936899
"An Automated Patient Chart Error Detection System for Radiation Therapy Project Summary/Abstract Every year, approximately 1,200 severe mistreatments happen in radiation therapy. Radiation therapy lawsuits rank in the top third of all medical specialties with an average of $313,000 per claim settled or litigated. The current method for detecting treatment errors is by a weekly patient chart check, where each treatment record is manually reviewed on a weekly basis. This labor-intensive and inefficient method prevents us from detecting the treatment error at an early stage. Here we propose a novel software system, ChartAlert, for automating patient chart checking. ChartAlert is a prospective real-time adaptive electronic checking system that can be configured to support different clinical workflows and perform “smart” check using artificial intelligence. It supports two major treatment databases (Elekta MOSAIQ and Varian ARIA) in radiotherapy. In Phase I project, we have successfully developed ChartAlert for MOSAIQ prototype that is under clinical testing in two treatment centers. Our preliminary results demonstrated the significant improvement of effectiveness in patient chart checking and the flexibility of supporting different workflows. In this Phase II proposal, we will continue the ChartAlert development. We will demonstrate the feasibility of the ChartAlert approach and its advantages over the standard manual checking method. We will develop a prospective checking module, develop the ARIA data translation module for ChartAlert for ARIA, design and implement an AI-based “smart” check module, and verify the proposed system at the partner sites. Successful completion of these aims will demonstrate the feasibility and commercial potential of the ChartAlert approach. Ultimately, this work will result in an intelligent patient chart checking software, which will increase patient chart check efficiency, save staff time, improve cancer patient treatment safety, and preventing potential lawsuits. Project Narrative Treatment errors in radiation oncology occur at a rate of 2% per patient, and radiation therapy lawsuits rank in the top third of all medical specialties with regard to claims made, claims paid, and damages. Current methods of detecting treatment errors are manual and inefficient. There is a critical need for efficient treatment error detection in order to improve patient safety and save cost. We propose to develop a scalable and comprehensive software system (ChartAlert) for automated patient chart error detection in radiation therapy. ChartAlert can be extended to other types of patient charts to check treatment and prescription consistency and improve patient safety.",An Automated Patient Chart Error Detection System for Radiation Therapy,10015207,R42CA195819,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Innovation Corps', 'Insurance', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Methods', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Records', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Framework', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'base', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'data streams', 'data structure', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'maltreatment', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'research clinical testing', 'software development', 'software systems', 'structured data', 'success', 'treatment center', 'treatment planning', 'treatment site', 'tumor']",NCI,"INFONDRIAN, LLC",R42,2020,855016,0.033743851511285367
"Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics The complex environment of modern radiation therapy (RT) comprises data from a rich combination of patient- specific information including: demographics, physical characteristics of high-energy dose, features subsequent to repeated application of image-guidance (radiomics), and biological markers (genomics, proteomics, etc.), generated before and/or over a treatment period that can span few days to several weeks. Rapid growth of these available and untapped “pan-Omics” data, invites ample opportunities for Big data analytics to deliver on the promise of personalized medicine in RT. This particularly true in promising but high-risk RT procedures such as stereotactic body RT (SBRT), which have witnessed tremendous expansion due to clinical successes in early disease stages and socio-economic benefits of shortened high dose treatments. This has led to the desire to exploit these treatments into more advanced stages of cancer, however, the unknown risks associated with increased toxicities hamper its potential. Therefore, robust clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) capable of exploring the complex pan-Omics interaction landscape with the goal of exploiting known principles of treatment response before and during the course of fractionated RT are urgently needed. The long-term goal of this project is to overcome barriers related to prediction uncertainties and human-computer interactions, which are currently limiting the ability to make personalized clinical decisions for real-time response-based adaptation in radiotherapy from available data. To meet this need and overcome current challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team including: clinicians, medical physicists, data scientists, and human factor experts. Specifically, we will develop and quantitively evaluate: (1) graph-based supervised machine learning algorithms for robust prediction outcomes before and during RT; (2) deep reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize treatment adaptation; and (3) a user-centered software prototype for RT decision support, with the broader goal of building a comprehensive real-time framework for outcome modeling and response-based adaption in RT. We hypothesize that the use of advanced machine learning techniques and user-centered tools will unlock the potentials to move from current population-based approaches limited by subjective experiences and heuristic rules into robust, patient-specific, user-friendly CDSSs. This approach and its corresponding software tool will be tested within two clinical RT sites of lung and liver cancers, to demonstrate its versatility and highlight pertinent human-computer factors and cancer specific issues. Impact statement: Patient-specific big data are now available before and/or during RT courses, offering new and untapped opportunities for personalized treatment. This study will overcome current shortcomings of population-based approaches and data underuse in current RT practice by investigating and developing an intelligent, computer-aided, user-centered, personalized CDSS and test its performance in rewarding but high- risk RT scenarios. The approach is also applicable to other modern cancer regimens. With the wide variety of treatment prescription options in radiation therapy, physicians and patients need to weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment; these treatments are delivered over multiple treatment sessions where additional patient-specific data become available. Clinical decision support can play a pivotal role in deliberations related to response-based adaptation of treatment. Therefore, we are exploring and benchmarking large-scale adaptive machine learning methods for building a robust decision support system tool in terms of efficacy, human-computer factors, and the ability to handle large data uncertainties for clinical practice in the complex but promising environment of high dose radiation treatment of lung and liver cancers as case studies.",Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics,9947903,R01CA233487,"['Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Network', 'Bedside Testings', 'Benchmarking', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose Fractionation', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hostage', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reaction Time', 'Regimen', 'Regrets', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computer human interaction', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'demographics', 'experience', 'fractionated radiation', 'heuristics', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'irradiation', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'radiation risk', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'side effect', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment duration', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,112864,0.040855791555405044

Therefore, we are exploring and benchmarking large-scale adaptive machine learning methods for building a robust decision support system tool in terms of efficacy, human-computer factors, and the ability to handle large data uncertainties for clinical practice in the complex but promising environment of high dose radiation treatment of lung and liver cancers as case studies.",Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics,10250778,R01CA233487,"['Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Network', 'Bedside Testings', 'Benchmarking', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose Fractionation', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hostage', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reaction Time', 'Regimen', 'Regrets', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computer human interaction', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'demographics', 'experience', 'fractionated radiation', 'heuristics', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'irradiation', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'radiation risk', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'side effect', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment duration', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NCI,H.

"Statistical and Machine Learning Methods for Integrating Clinical and Multimodal Imaging Data to Select Optimal Antidepressant Treatment Summary: The public health burden of major depressive disorder (MDD) is immense and current approaches for selecting antidepressant treatment have had limited success. By some estimates, fewer than one in three MDD patients will respond to their prescribed antidepressant and the quest for a treatment that will work is typically characterized by a lengthy course of trial-and-error. The need to identify patient characteristics (biomarkers) that can be used to objectively select personalized antidepressant treatment is clear. Accordingly, large clinical studies like the NIMH-funded Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) study have collected massive amounts of baseline measures including those from various neuroimaging sources in the hope that some can be used to guide antidepressant treatment selection. These data bring with them many statistical challenges that have yet to be effectively addressed. These challenges include (1) dealing with high-dimensionality, (2) handling data missingness, and (3) determining how best to simultaneously model relationships between measures from multiple imaging modalities and the response of interest. The goal of this project is to acquire the essential training and experience to make significant progress in this area by addressing each of these challenges. Aim 1 of this project will employ state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning algorithms and targeted estimation to identify moderators of antidepressant treatment effect using scalar clinical, demographic, and summary neuroimaging data from clinical trials of antidepressant treatments, including EMBARC. Strategies for handling missing data in this context will also be investigated and guidelines on best practices will be proposed. Aim 2 will extend the methods used in Aim 1 and develop user-friendly software to directly incorporate high- dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data into treatment decision rules. Included in this aim will be an investigation into best practices for handling missing high-dimensional imaging data in the context of estimating treatment decision rules. Aim 3 will employ the novel methods developed in Aim 2 and the estimated treatment decision rules will be evaluated and compared with those developed in Aim 1. I have put together a training program that directly supports the completion of these research aims. It includes instruction, mentoring, and hands-on-experience (1) in psychopathology and the neural basis for psychiatric disorders and treatment for those disorders; (2) in the use of neuroimaging data to understand depression and response to antidepressant treatment; (3) in the use of modern algorithms to store, process, manipulate, and analyze big biomedical data like those arising in multimodal neuroimaging studies. This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the training, time, and resources to be able to make substantial progress in addressing this important problem and will provide the skills and experience that will be crucial in my transition to an independent investigator. Public Health Relevance Statement: This proposal seeks to advance precision medicine through the development of new statistical methods that integrate clinical, demographic, and high-dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data to estimate treatment decision rules. The proposed research and training are laid out in the context of depression but the statistical tools to be developed will be general enough for constructing treatment decision rules for a wide array of diseases using a variety of data types. These statistical tools have the potential to reduce the burden of diseases like depression by providing personalized treatment that has the best chance for success.",Statistical and Machine Learning Methods for Integrating Clinical and Multimodal Imaging Data to Select Optimal Antidepressant Treatment,9994391,K01MH113850,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Instruction', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sertraline', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'Writing', 'big biomedical data', 'biosignature', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'data reduction', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging modality', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,162343,0.06631404389688374
"Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment Abstract Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with preferential delivery of 90Y microspheres to target lesions has shown promising response rates with limited toxicity in the treatment of hepatocellular (HCC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the world. However, to achieve more durable responses, there is much room to improve/adapt the treatment to ensure that all lesions and lesion sub-regions receive adequate radiation delivery. While externally delivered stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is well suited for smaller solitary HCC, its application for larger or multifocal disease is challenged by the radiation tolerance of the normal liver parenchyma. A dosimetry guided combined approach that exploits complementary advantages of internal and external radiation delivery can be expected to improve treatment of HCC. To make this transition, however, prospective clinical trials establishing safety are needed. Furthermore, for routine clinic use, accurate and fast voxel-level dose estimation in internal radionuclide therapy, that lags behind external beam therapy dosimetry, is still needed. Our long-term goal is to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy with personalized dosimetry guided treatment. Our objective in this application is to demonstrate that it is possible to use 90Y imaging based absorbed dose estimates after SIRT to safely deliver external radiation to target regions (voxels) that are predicted to be underdosed and to develop deep learning based tools to make voxel-level internal dose estimation practical for routine clinic use. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will perform a Phase 1 clinical trial in HCC patients where we will take the novel approach of using the 90Y PET/CT derived absorbed dose map after SIRT to deliver SBRT to tumor regions predicted to be underdosed based on previously established dose-response models. The primary objective of the trial is to obtain estimates of safety of combined SIRT+SBRT for future Phase II trial design. In parallel, in Aim 2, building on promising initial results we will develop novel deep learning based tools for 90Y PET/CT and SPECT/CT reconstruction, joint reconstruction-segmentation and scatter estimation under the low count-rate setting, typical for 90Y. These methods have a physics/mathematics foundation, where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are included within the iterative reconstruction process, instead of post-reconstruction denoising. In Aim 3, we will develop a CNN for fast voxel-level dosimetry and combine with the CNNs of Aim 2 to develop an innovative end-to-end framework with unified dosimetry-task based training. At the end of this study, we will be ready to use the new deep learning tools in a Phase II trial to demonstrate enhanced efficacy with SIRT+SBRT compared with SIRT alone and advance towards our long- term goal. This will accelerate adoption of these next-generation tools in clinical practice and will have a significant positive impact because treatment based on patient specific dosimetry will substantially improve efficacy, compared with current standard practice in SIRT. Although we focus on 90Y SIRT, our tools will be applicable in radionuclide therapy in general, a rapidly advancing treatment option. Narrative We will perform a Phase I clinical trial where standard-of-care Y-90 microsphere radioembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma will be followed by external radiation to target regions that are predicted to be underdosed by Y-90, based on patient specific dosimetry. In parallel, we will develop and test voxel-level internal dosimetry tools using convolution neural networks to make such dosimetry-based planning accurate and fast for routine clinic use. This study is relevant to public health because a dosimetry-guided combination radiation treatment approach is likely to substantially improve patient outcome compared to current standard practice of internal or external radiation only.",Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment,10052989,R01EB022075,"['90Y', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Evaluable Disease', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver parenchyma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radioembolization', 'Radionuclide therapy', 'Reporting', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'dosimetry', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'internal radiation', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'phase II trial', 'prospective', 'radiation delivery', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,670584,0.009379546388894022
"Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone and the Adaptive Treatment for Cocaine Dependence trials, sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for alcohol or/and cocaine dependent patients. One of the main challenges in these trials is the high rate of noncompliance to the assigned treatments. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal ATS is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Existing methods in analyzing SMART data are limited to intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. That is the treatment effect at each stage is estimated based on the treatment group to which an individual was randomized at that stage regardless of whether the individual complied with their assigned treatment. One major concern is that the relationship between the experimental manipulation and the outcome may be confounded by treatment noncompliance. We develop methodologies that can be used to adjust for noncompliance in analyzing data collected in SMARTs. Specifically, we extend the principal strata framework and Bayesian Copulas to multi-stage randomized trials setting and propose novel procedures that estimate the mean outcome under different ATSs. We also propose a novel Bayesian machine learning approach that can be used to construct deeply tailored (i.e., individualized) treatment strategies that take into account patients' demographic factors, measures of mental health and alcohol use, obsessive-compulsive drinking and alcohol craving scales, physical composite scores. Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available open-source software leveraging the R and Python languages that implements our methods. This will provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal ATSs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for analysis of sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) data in the presence of partial compliance. The methods developed in this project will improve the usefulness, interpretability and generalizability of the results obtained by SMARTs and help mental health and substance use disorder scientists to develop more potent adaptive treatment strategies to guide the individualization of mental health and substance use disorder treatments.","Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance",10017030,R01DA048764,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian learning', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol craving', 'arm', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'non-compliance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient response', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'virtual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2020,191907,0.01469827668242322
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS), relevant biological predictors, and precision treatment response trajectories.",Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress,9952129,R01MH116156,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Trauma patient', 'Trauma recovery', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'combat', 'computational platform', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'diverse data', 'feature selection', 'federated computing', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'heterogenous data', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'post-traumatic stress', 'post-traumatic symptoms', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'stress related disorder', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'treatment planning', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,501996,0.02275032214162706
"Data-driven approaches in defining knee osteoarthritis phenotypes and factors  associated with fast progression Osteoarthritis (OA) affects 14 million individuals in the US and over 300 million adults worldwide. The disease is characterized by joint pain and functional limitations and is associated with poor health- related quality of life and increased healthcare utilization. OA of the hips and knees ranks as the 11th highest contributor to global disability. Despite the clinical and economic impact of knee OA, no disease-modifying agents are currently available; current treatments are limited to symptom control and are only modestly efficacious. While several promising treatments are in the pipeline, developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity. We urgently need to identify the right patient for the right treatment to ensure that new therapies are being tested on the appropriate population. This proposal aims to use machine learning methods to address gaps in our understanding of disease heterogeneity in knee OA. We will use publicly available data from the FNIH OA Biomarkers Consortium project. This study of 600 subjects with knee OA includes over 200 parameters that describe the joint structure and disease severity, including measures of cartilage, bone, ligaments, menisci, and inflammation. An unsupervised learning approach using model-based clustering will be used to distinguish disease phenotypes. To implement phenotyping in practice a minimal set of biomarkers must be identified that meets the challenges of both predictive accuracy and feasibility. Thus the second aim will investigate variable selection methods in model-based clustering in order to identify important variables and develop a prediction model to determine phenotype. Finally, a supervised machine learning approach via super learning will investigate algorithms to predict disease progression. The applicant, Dr. Jamie Collins, is a biostatistician at the Orthopedic and Arthritis Center for Outcomes Research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Dr. Collins is a committed investigator in rheumatology research with eight first author publications in the field. She holds a career development award from the Rheumatology Research Foundation and pilot funding from the Brigham Research Institute. This proposal will provide protected time and rigorous training so that the applicant can expand her current biostatistical skill set to encompass the burgeoning fields of data science and machine learning. She will take coursework at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and will have access to courses, seminars, and training provided by the Brigham Research Institute and the Harvard Catalyst Program. The applicant will be supported by mentorship from Drs. Elena Losina and Tuhina Neogi, and input from the advisory committee of Drs. Tianxi Cai, Jeffrey Duryea, Ali Guermazi, Tina Kapur, Virginia Kraus, Katherine Liao, and Kurt Spindler. The research and training proposed in this award will address critical research gaps in our understanding of OA heterogeneity and progression. This will set Dr. Collins on the path towards independence and her long-term career objective of being an independent investigator with a focus on applying advanced analytic methods in OA research. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disabling disease that affects millions of people worldwide; there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies capable of providing symptom control and arresting structural progression.

"Deriving high-quality evidence from national healthcare databases to improve suicidality detection and treatment outcomes in PTSD and TBI PROJECT SUMMARY Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has complex profiles of co-occurring medical conditions (comorbidities) and is associated with high risk of suicide, particularly among Veterans, in which it is a leading cause of death. There is a critical lack of advancement in PTSD pharmacotherapy, as illustrated by increased use of off-label medications and polypharmacy (multiple drugs used simultaneously). The consequent limited evidence on the relative risks and benefits of treatments creates a crisis in PTSD management. Moreover, PTSD and its major comorbidities [traumatic brain injury (TBI) and suicidality] often remain undocumented in electronic health records (EHR). There is also poor predictability of disease outcomes since there are frequent changes in pharmacological treatment and multiple modifying comorbidities. Our long-term goal is to improve diagnostics, secondary/tertiary prevention, and treatment outcomes of PTSD and its comorbidities via enhanced EHR utilization. To achieve our objectives, we will analyze EHR and administrative claims data from Veterans Administration (VA) and non-VA databases, collectively covering >2M PTSD and >2M TBI patients. Specifically, we aim to: (1) Identify undetected PTSD, TBI, and self-harm from EHRs (using machine learning with and without natural language language processing) to guide health service improvements. (2) Predict PTSD clinical course in the VA population through novel modeling of disease trajectories that account for time-varying treatments and biases (3) Compare the effectiveness of PTSD psychotropic monotherapies, polypharmacy, and psychotherapy to guide the choice of treatment for improved patient outcomes. By enhancing and validating a machine learning approach developed by our team, we will impute unrecorded PTSD, TBI, and self-harm from both datasets, and characterize factors associated with documentation disparities. We will model diseases trajectories with enhanced latent class analysis, focusing on self-harm, substance misuse, and psychiatric hospitalization in PTSD. With Local Control methodology innovations, we will compare the risk of PTSD in veterans with and without comorbid TBI. Finally, we will perform the largest comparative effectiveness studies (to date) of PTSD treatments on >100 monotherapy and polypharmacy regimens plus psychotherapy interventions. These studies will provide high-quality evidence on the risk of hospitalizations, substance misuse, and suicidal acts/self-harm. Successful completion of these investigations will improve the quality of decision making for providers and patients, and guide improved service delivery to the population of veterans and non-veterans with PTSD/TBI, and/or high risk of suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and its associated conditions (e.g., traumatic brain injury and suicidality) are often underdiagnosed, and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Treatment of PTSD often involves frequent treatment changes with multi-drug regimens (polypharmacy) and off-label medications for which the relative risks and benefits are largely unknown. To address these problems, we will develop and apply methods to identify undiagnosed patients, predict disease trajectories, and compare the effectiveness of all common PTSD treatments using health records from millions of patients in Veterans Administration (VA) and non-VA databases.",Deriving high-quality evidence from national healthcare databases to improve suicidality detection and treatment outcomes in PTSD and TBI,10088135,R56MH120826,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Drug Combinations', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'General Population', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Provider', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotherapy', 'Regimen', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Safety', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Source', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Veterans', 'analysis pipeline', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'health record', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'language processing', 'multiple drug use', 'natural language', 'novel', 'off-label drug', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'service delivery', 'sociodemographic factors', 'stress related disorder', 'substance misuse', 'suicidal act', 'suicidal risk', 'tertiary prevention', 'therapy design', 'time use', 'treatment choice', 'treatment comparison']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,R56,2020,776198,-0.027789217654080704
"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits. This project aims to combine smartphone and wearable sensor data with machine learning to remotely monitor symptoms during chemotherapy and to develop a system that automatically recommends patient-provider contact when severe symptoms are detected.",A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy,9962316,R37CA242545,"['Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Heart Rate', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Notification', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer therapy', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'chemotherapy', 'common treatment', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'mobile computing', 'multi-site trial', 'novel', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symptom management', 'trial comparing', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2020,361165,0.012727307463879647
"Development of a scalable, portable device platform to help objectively monitor the treatment of substance abuse. Abstract Assessing the effectiveness of substance abuse rehabilitation, where high relapse rates create financial and social tolls, is a pressing clinical problem in need of better measurement tools. The ability to identify cognitive changes should improve outcomes but current intake into rehabilitation programs doesn’t typically include cognitive tests. Simple, quick, cost-effective, and objective measures are needed. This is the problem this proposal seeks to address. This proposal utilizes the experience of Evolve Behavioral Health which serve 150 patients weekly, and WAVi, a commercialized brain-assessment platform that combines EEG evoked responses (ERP) with 5 other tests also sensitive to addiction (heart rate variability, physical reaction times, MoCA, Trail Making, and Flanker). This user-friendly platform focuses on minimizing testing times and cost while maximizing information. Our first premise is that adding these tests will help us identify those addicts whose cognitive state requires modified treatment approaches, and this will decrease relapse rates and recidivism rates. Our second premise is that we can create a dataset that can be trained to identify appropriate treatment regimens on an individual basis from the initial baseline test. To date, WAVi data have shown ERP to be highly sensitive to concussion (another cognitive issue) and that artificial intelligence on raw EEG can classify both PTSD and musculoskeletal pain with high sensitivities and specificities. The aims of this project are to develop a scalable EEG-based test for rehabilitation facilities that is readily accessible to clinicians and to create a dynamic data asset to help longitudinally predict outcomes. Accomplishing these aims will assist clinicians on the front lines of substance abuse assessment and treatment. Narrative This project will help create an objective and clinically accessible test to be used in substance-abuse rehabilitation programs to assist clinicians in making intervention choices as well as determining the timing of release from rehabilitation.","Development of a scalable, portable device platform to help objectively monitor the treatment of substance abuse.",10145897,R43DA053012,"['Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auditory', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Domains', 'Publishing', 'Reaction Time', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'biopsychosocial', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'expectation', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'multimodality', 'novel marker', 'open data', 'outcome prediction', 'outpatient facility', 'phase 2 study', 'point of care', 'portability', 'programs', 'recidivism', 'response', 'social', 'standard measure', 'substance abuse rehabilitation', 'substance abuse treatment', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'user-friendly']",NIDA,WAVI COMPANY,R43,2020,221675,-0.00443245939142957
"Personalized Statin Treatment Plan to Optimize Clinical Outcomes Using Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY An estimated 47% of Americans 65 years of age and older take statins, which are highly effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and reducing all-cause mortality. Unfortunately, ~50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain these critical benefits because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation. There, Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with ASCVD. In clinical practice, statin-associated symptoms (SAS) often result in dose reduction or discontinuation of these life-saving medications. Currently, physicians employ reactive strategies to manage SAS concerns after they manifest, such as offering an alternative statin treatment plan (e.g., reducing dosage or changing medication) or a `statin holiday'. However, with numerous statin treatment strategies available and no means of optimizing their match to a given patient, physician decision-making is based on minimal patient data elements. Moreover, using a single patient's data to identify the optimal statin regimen and treatment plan is inadequate to ensure that the harms of statin use are minimized and the benefits are maximized. A decision- support system, by contrast, can use a vast number of variables from a large number of patients (“big data”) to match an optimal statin treatment plan to an individual patient prospectively. We propose to use complex patient information to develop and test an effective predictive model and tool, the personalized statin treatment plan (PSTP) platform, which could be used by physicians to optimize personalized statin treatment to minimize harms (SAS and statin discontinuation) while at the same time maximizing benefits (LDL reduction). The proposed study leverages data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (which includes more than 20 years of insurance claims and electronic health records data from more than 150 million patients across the United States), as well as clinical trial simulations, for model development, validation, and evaluation. We will address the following specific aims: 1) Develop and validate a deep-learning model to predict both SAS and statin discontinuation using linked insurance claims and EHR data; 2) Develop and validate the PSTP platform to identify statin treatment plans that optimize both LDL reduction (benefit) and SAS and statin discontinuation (harm) for a given patient profile; and 3) Evaluate the PSTP relative to current and guideline-driven practices using CTS to assess clinical benefits and harms. The proposed study will produce a precision-medicine tool to empower physicians to make proactive clinical decisions regarding statin treatment planning (i.e., selecting the statin drug and dosage optimized for a particular patient to maximize LDL reduction and minimize statin discontinuation and SAS) before any statin is prescribed. The implementation of such a tool would substantially improve public health by reducing statin discontinuation and sub-optimal clinical outcomes inherent in current reactive statin-prescribing strategies based on non-personalized statin treatment plans. PROJECT NARRATIVE About 50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain critical benefits in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and reducing all-cause mortality because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation largely due to statin-associated symptoms.

"Pathophysiology Informed Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Early Psychosis (PIB) The introduction of Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) has transformed the standard of care and elevated treatment outcome goals for young individuals experiencing the initial stages of a psychotic illness (EP). The response to treatment for EP individuals receiving CSC, however, remains highly variable. A substantial proportion show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices comprising this treatment model. Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond to treatment and published data show that expert clinicians perform no better than chance. Early identification of treatment non-responders has very high clinical significance and would inform and enhance clinical decision making during the first few months of care. Surprisingly, little research has been conducted on baseline predictors of treatment outcomes in EP individuals entering CSC. During the past two decades, considerable progress has been made using neuroimaging to investigate pathophysiological processes during the early phases of illness. Furthermore, limited data suggest that fMRI measures of brain activity and PET measures of increased dopamine synthesis are related to treatment outcomes in EP. We have recently demonstrated in a moderately large sample of EP patients entering CSC that the ability to activate the frontal parietal (FP) cognitive control network (measured using fMRI during the AX- CPT task) is a significant predictor of who will meet responder criterion after one year of CSC. We propose to replicate and extend this result by examining the predictive ability of this and two other promising MRI based measures linked to pathophysiological processes related to psychosis: 1) free water diffusion tensor imaging (FW) - a putative biomarker of neuroinflammation that is increased in EP individuals, and 2) midbrain neuromelanin (NM) scans, which index midbrain dopamine, shown to be decreased in Parkinson's disease and increased in schizophrenia. Each of these measures will be used individually to predict responder status for EP participants entering CSC. In addition to these analyses we will use novel deep learning methods to optimize the prediction of treatment response in EP individuals entering CSC and to obtain new insights into the mechanisms underlying these effects. Our goal is to leverage recent progress in the development of MRI based imaging biomarkers to develop a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at high risk for non-response and thereby inform treatment decision making for all patients in order to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness. A substantial proportion of early psychosis EP individuals show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices provided by coordinated specialty care (CSC). Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond and who will not. In this project we will leverage recent progress in the development of pathophysiologically informed MRI based imaging biomarkers along with novel computational image analysis, to develop a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at high risk for non-response and thereby inform clinical decision making to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness.",Pathophysiology Informed Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Early Psychosis (PIB),10060889,R01MH122139,"['Adjuvant', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Clozapine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Parietal', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'indexing', 'ineffective therapies', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuromelanin', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'psychosocial', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'responders and non-responders', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'water diffusion', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,757956,0.022493689339198583
"Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application for an NIMH Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) entitled ""Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia."" In this application, Dr. Miklos Argyelan proposes a comprehensive plan for transitioning into an independent translational researcher focused on understanding the neural mechanisms of treatment response in schizophrenia by integrating functional neuroimaging with neuromodulatory bioelectric treatment approaches. Despite its effectiveness and intensive research, the mechanism of action for ECT remains unknown, and currently no clinical or biological biomarkers exist to predict response. In patients with schizophrenia undergoing a trial of ECT (with bitemporal electrode placement), the proposed study will use resting-state functional MRI, as well as electrical field modeling as applied to structural MRI scans, to examine the neural circuitry underlying clinical response. Patients will undergo MRI scanning at baseline, and after the 8th ECT treatment. Results of this proposal may lead to biomarkers that will optimize treatment algorithms for schizophrenia with higher efficacy. Identifying target mechanisms would not only improve the current deployment of bioelectric approaches as part of a “precision medicine” approach, but could also lead to the development of novel therapies. This line of research will be conducted under the guidance of mentors who are recognized experts in the biomarker research of schizophrenia (Anil K. Malhotra, M.D.), neuromodulation (Georgios Petrides, M.D., Marom Bikson Ph.D.), neuroimaging of ECT (Chris Abbott, M.D.) and analyzing high dimensional datasets (Jing Sui, PhD.). Concurrently, Dr Argyelan will engage in a comprehensive training program which is fully integrated with the research study in the proposal. The training plan contains three domains with corresponding goals: (1) to gain further expertise in designing and conducting clinical trials in schizophrenia, (2) to expand my knowledge in machine learning algorithms, and (3) to learn more about electrical field (EF) modeling techniques. The combination of training in clinical trials, machine learning and neuromodulation will support the planned research to provide the framework to explore and validate biomarkers of disease and treatment response. The culmination of these training activities, combined with the planned research aims under this award, will prepare Dr. Argyelan to develop into an independent translational researcher and to submit a planned R01 in personalized neuromodulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been consistently shown to be an effective augmentation strategy in the treatment of schizophrenia, however its mechanism of action remains unknown, and there are no clinical or biological predictors to predict response. The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to examine the functional neural circuitry that underlies successful treatment with ECT, which may lead to the identification of biomarkers that will allow for more efficient use of ECT, as well as additional treatment targets for patients with refractory illness.

"Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages PROJECT ABSTRACT Health insurance has been at the forefront of US public policy debate throughout the last decade. For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965. Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be a controversial definition. Some decisions about what Medicare should cover have engendered intense debate, underscoring the importance of the program’s coverage decisions for millions of patients and doctors. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. Yet, despite the importance of decisions about the scope of insurance coverage in and outside of Medicare, we know little about how the scope of coverage (as opposed to patient cost-sharing), affects treatment choices, clinical practice, and health outcomes for the elderly. The research outlined in this proposal aims to start filling this gap. The project investigates how the presence or lack of insurance coverage for specific procedural or pharmacologic therapies affects treatment decisions and health outcomes for the elderly with Alzheimer’s Disease and related Dementias (ADRD). This is a population that may be particularly vulnerable to changes and limits in insurance coverage, as the patients may have limited decision-making capacity and may be disproportionately exposed to treatments that are deemed experimental and lacking effectiveness to clear the “reasonable and necessary” threshold. Aim 1 of the project is to estimate the average effect of coverage decisions across prescription drugs and outpatient procedures on treatment decisions and health outcomes of elderly Medicare enrollees with ADRD. Aim 2 is to predict and characterize the subgroups of ADRD patients that are most likely to be affected by decisions that restrict the scope of insurance coverage using machine learning methods. The proposed empirical method is to use quasi- experimental variation that arises from natural experiments of abrupt changes in insurance coverage within different parts of the Medicare program. The analysis takes advantage of variation in the scope of formularies across Medicare Part D plans, as well as the variation in local coverage decisions for physician services and outpatient procedures under Medicare Part B. These sources of variation coupled with methods for quasi- experimental estimation of treatment effects and machine learning methods for heterogeneity analyses, allow estimating the response of treatment decisions and health of the elderly with ADRD across different drugs, procedures, and subgroups of ADRD patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965 - Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but nevertheless incomplete as by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be hard to define. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. In this project I investigate how changes in coverage for prescription drugs, physician office visits, and outpatient procedures affect the treatment received by elderly patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD), who often face coverage limitations due to experimental nature of many ADRD treatments, and yet may be most vulnerable to unintended consequences of any coverage restrictions.",Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages,9928348,K01AG059843,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Anxiety', 'Barbiturates', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cost Sharing', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family Physicians', 'Formularies', 'Fracture', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Geriatrics', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part B', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Natural experiment', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic procedure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universal Coverage', 'Variant', 'aging population', 'alternative treatment', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'decision-making capacity', 'design', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,126700,0.027036643188515404
"PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target Need. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension (HTN) have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. BP above clinical Target even for a few months increases the risk for stroke (35-40%), heart failure (HF) (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (MI) (15-25%). Physician-nurse-pharmacist resource-intensive demonstrations in achieving & maintaining BP Target have shown promising results, but their real-life deployment was found unsustainable long-term. As a result, a process-standardized and sustainable solution is acutely needed.  Solution. In response to this need, Optima Integrated Health developed optima4BP 1.0. It is a first-in-class artificial intelligence (AI) that simulates the process of clinical reasoning undertaken by the treating physician in optimizing the anti-HTN treatment towards BP Target. Just like the physician, optima4BP 1.0 cannot determine upfront the needed Optimal Treatment (OT) to achieve & maintain BP Target for 1-2 years. PROTECT [optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and route to achieve and maintain BP Target] proposes to establish upfront the personalized OT. The OT can then be used to select the shortest and safest treatment modification route needed to achieve & maintain BP Target. Phase II Goal. Build optima4BP 2.0.  Phase I. Phase I Prior Work demonstrated that k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), an AI model, can predict with ≥ 80% confidence the correct anti-HTN treatment, when compared to physician decision.  Phase II. optima4BP 2.0 will predict the Optimal Treatment and route to achieve & maintain BP Target.  Optimal Treatment data-mining source. PROTECT will use the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, 2015) and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, 2010) clinical trial data. They represent the foundation of the most current anti-HTN treatment management national guidelines.  Aim 1. Build kNN. Hypothesis. kNN can predict the proximity (clinical relevance) of a patient to an Optimal Treatment (OT). Milestone. Achieve ≥ 90% accuracy of prediction to physician decision. Phase I Data Preparation protocol will be applied to the SPRINT & ACCORD data. Then, the kNN Ensemble Learning function will be built to select the Optimal Treatment with the highest demonstrated efficacy by comparing the choice from 3 computational approaches developed and tested during Phase I.  Aim 2. Build the Optimal Treatment Route (OTR). Hypothesis. Knowing the Current and Optimal Treatment (OT), an OTR can be built. Milestone. Safest Route: Achieve 100% exclusion of treatments that led to an adverse event in similar patient populations. Shortest Route: Achieve ≥30% reduction in number of treatment changes compared to physician route. The OTR will be built by comparing at each Step on the Route how similar each Candidate Treatment is to the OT through a computed similarity assessment.  optima4BP 2.0 aims to establish a process-standardized & sustainable solution with the goal of reducing the incidence of stroke, HF, MI and death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension have their blood pressure uncontrolled. We propose to build and test optima4BP 2.0 (Project Name: PROTECT) that will predict upfront the personalized optimal treatment and shortest treatment route required by a patient to achieve and maintain blood pressure target. Achieving and maintaining blood pressure target will reduce the incidence of adverse events [stroke (35-40%), heart failure (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (15-25%)] or death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension.",PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target,9901106,R44HL140624,"['Acute', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Euclidean Space', 'Exclusion', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resources', 'Route', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Women&apos', 's Role', 'Work', 'base', 'blood pressure intervention', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'commercial application', 'comparative efficacy', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'hypertension treatment', 'innovation', 'optimal treatments', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'processing speed', 'response', 'stroke incidence', 'stroke risk', 'success']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2020,750249,0.01825794206239909
"Automated Treatment Planning for High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy for Cervical Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Cervical cancer affects approximately 7.4/100,000 women in the US with minority women being disproportionally affected. High dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy is an effective treatment modality by irradiating the tumor from inside while simultaneously sparing dose to nearby organs. Multiple randomized trials revealed that including HDR brachytherapy in cervical cancer radiotherapy increases overall survival rates from 46.2% to 58.2%. Yet HDR brachytherapy has seen a downward trend in its use, with complex treatment planning process being one of the major reasons, causing a 13% reduction in cause-specific survival rate. For HDR brachytherapy, the planning has to be accomplished in a very short period of time to reduce patient discomfort and patient motion during the planning process, which could causes substantial deviation of planning geometry from delivery geometry (1.5mm motion leads to >10% change in dose). At present, it takes on average 135 min to manually generate a treatment plan. Due to the time pressure, suboptimal plans are often generated. D2cc, the dosimetric quantity correlated to organ toxicity could be further reduced up to 8.4%, corresponding to 5.1% reduction of complication rate. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop a fully automated treatment planning process to reduce planning time, improve plan quality and therefore outcome, reduce patient discomfort, and most significantly, to promote the use of HDR brachytherapy. Our group has successfully developed and clinically implemented the AutoBrachy system, an automatic planning tool that generates a patient-generic plan in 3 minutes. However, automatic organ segmentation and physician-oriented treatment planning are missing, preventing a fully automated process to generate the patient-specific optimal plan. Current practice relies on human expertise to solve the two problems, taking up to 90 min for segmentation and 30 min for planner and physician to finalize plan. Given the recent advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in mimicking humans to achieve human-level performance, we believe that AI can be used to empower AutoBrachy to achieve a fully automated planning process. The overall goal of this fellowship project is to develop AI-based organ segmentation and human-like treatment planning modules in AutoBrachy, and to validate the system in real patient cases. We will pursue two specific aims (SAs): SA1: System development. Create an automatic organ segmentation module and a human-like automatic planning module. SA2: System validation. Perform a retrospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of the developments. The innovation is the use of state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve critical problems in HDR brachytherapy.

"Evaluation of molecular mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression DESCRIPTION: Over the past decades, antidepressants and psychotherapy have been the first-line treatments for LLD. Despite being safe and well-tolerated, a large number of patients do not achieve full and persistent remission after initial treatment. About 50% of patients with LLD do not respond after two antidepressant trials, meeting the consensus definition of treatment resistance (TR-LLD). The persistence of chronic and elevated depressive symptoms in older adults has significant clinical and public health implications. This has been correlated to poor general health, reduced quality of life, and a higher risk of mortality when compared to those with sustained remission after treatment. Despite the relevance to public health of TR-LLD, there is little information about the biological mechanisms and no robust clinical prediction model to evaluate at the outset of antidepressant therapy who will or will not respond to treatment. Leveraging an NIMH funded clinical trial, the Incomplete Response in Late-Life Depression: Getting to Remission” (IRL-GREY), across 3 sites, in this study, we propose to evaluate the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression and to develop a machine learning based algorithm for prediction of treatment response in these subjects. We will carry out a comprehensive, multiplexed proteomic analysis on 542 samples from patients who completed phase 1 and phase 2 of the clinical trial. We hypothesise that ageing-related biological pathways (i.e. inflammatory response control, proteostasis control, cell damage response, endothelial function) will be associated with poorer treatment response in LLD. Moreover, we hypothesize that a machine learning derived biomarker panel will have sensitivity and specificity greater than 80% to predict treatment response in LLD. Finally, we will evaluate the biological mechanisms related to different depressive symptoms trajectories after treatment. This work will set the stage for a biologically-driven model of treatment response that will be useful to guide, at the outset of antidepressant treatment, those who will benefit more from a specific treatment. If successful, our work can accelerate therapeutic efforts and innovation targeting depression and reduce suffering for large numbers of elderly and their families. Using advanced molecular approaches, we will determine the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression. Our proposed study will also develop a predictive tool combining neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and protein data to identify who with late-life depression is more likely to have no benefit from antidepressant treatment at the outset of therapy. The goal of the study is to clarify the mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression, and whether we can effectively identify those who will benefit from antidepressant therapy at the outset of treatment.",Evaluation of molecular mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression,9966041,R01MH118311,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Disease remission', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Elderly', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'aripiprazole', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'geriatric depression', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'open label', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'proteostasis', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'venlafaxine']",NIMH,CENTRE FOR ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH,R01,2020,516549,0.07972703153773636
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,9851853,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomarker performance', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2020,161422,0.0002953031899878654
"Predicting Patient Outcome in Multiple Sclerosis using a Quantitative Radiomic Approach Project Summary: Multiple sclerosis (MS), a leading cause of disability in young and middle-aged adults, is a highly heterogeneous disease, with wide variations in clinical presentation, disease course and response to treatment. In order to personalize care in MS, it is important to harness its clinical heterogeneity and the diversity of its underlying pathology, and to develop models able to predict individual behavior of patients. Brain magnetic resonance images (MRI), acquired routinely in MS patients, contain information that reflects underlying pathophysiology, which may be brought into light through quantitative analyses. Radiomics, a technique well developed in oncology, converts routine medical images into mineable high-dimensional data that can be modeled to support clinical decision-making. The central hypothesis of the proposed project is that radiomic analysis, combined with careful feature selection and accurate modeling, can predict patient outcome and response to therapy using standard-of-care MRI in MS. Our hypothesis will be tested by leveraging existing 3-year imaging and clinical data from the CombiRx trial, a multi-center, phase-III investigation of combination therapy in 1008 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients. We will first determine the potential for non-invasive radiomic biomarkers of disease severity in RRMS. Towards this goal, we will extract radiomic features of MS lesions from FLAIR, pre and postcontrast T1-weighted MR images using an open-source radiomic pipeline. Through appropriate feature selection, we will identify an independent radiomic feature set able to characterize individual phenotype on MRI in a selection cohort. We will then evaluate the selected features cross-sectionally to determine their efficacy in characterizing disease severity, leveraging training and validation subsets. The performance of our radiomic approach will be compared to traditional models using clinical and standard imaging markers such as lesion volume. In the second stage of this proposal, we will explore the performance of radiomic-based models to predict long-term outcome and treatment response in MS. We will build models to predict disease activity free status (DAFS) at 3 years using selected baseline radiomic features, and identify treatment response phenotypes. We will investigate and compare the performance of various machine-learning models in an unbiased manner. Finally, we will assess the effect of each therapeutic regimen on radiomic features by comparing on-treatment changes across treatment arms. This may provide evidence for treatment-specific monitoring parameters.   Project Narrative:    Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and disabling disorder of the central nervous system affecting over 1  million  individuals  in  the  United  States.  Unambiguous  and  robust  clinical  prediction  of  individual  outcome  and  treatment  response  is  deeply  needed  to  provide  personalized  medicine  to  MS  patients,  reduce disability, and minimize the burden of MS on individuals and society. Radiomics has the potential  to contribute to decision-­‐support systems in MS, by transforming routinely acquired magnetic resonance  images into mineable high-­‐dimensional data.   ",Predicting Patient Outcome in Multiple Sclerosis using a Quantitative Radiomic Approach,9979980,R03NS109715,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis', 'Risk', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'digital', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'feature selection', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient response', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'response', 'routine practice', 'standard of care', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2020,81671,0.02332024502723503
"Optimal dynamic treatment strategies for controlling alcohol use: novel methods for selecting and incorporating effect modifiers Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone (ExTENd) trial, a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for those who are non-responsive to initial Naltrexone. One of the main challenges in this trial is the presence of the many variables available for consideration when making treatment decisions at each stage of the trial. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the ExTENd trial data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of a dynamic treatment regime (DTR) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal DTR is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Q-learning can be used with data from both SMARTs and observational studies to estimate an optimal DTR. However, like other model-based approaches, model misspecification can seriously affect the results and lead to the identification of suboptimal DTRs. The potential for misspecification increases with the number of variables that may influence treatment decisions through, e.g., incorrect assumptions on the relationship of variables to the outcome and the inclusion (exclusion) of unimportant (important) variables. These features represent the main analytical challenges for the ExTENd trial. We propose a new approach to Q-learning that leverages machine learning approaches to reduce the chances of misspecifying the relationship between the expected outcome and a given set of variables. We also develop a variable selection technique specifically designed for Q-learning that enables investigators to select the important variables from a long list of possibilities (e.g., genetic and demographic information, medical history over time) when estimating an optimal DTR. In both settings, we will develop new methods for conducting valid inferences (e.g., confidence intervals and p-values), including when there exist patients for whom treatment is neither beneficial nor harmful at a given decision stage (i.e., when an important technical assumption, “uniqueness”, is violated). Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available software in the R language that implements our methods. This will allow re-analysis of the ExTENd trial data with a goal of constructing a DTR that improves upon the current rescue treatment strategy for those non-responsive to initial Naltrexone. It will also provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal DTRs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for estimating the optimal treatment regime in substance use disorder. We will develop a variable selection technique that enables investigators to select important variables for the decision- making process among a long list of variables (e.g., patient’s genetic information, demographic characteristics, and medical history over time). We will also leverage statistical machine learning approaches to improve the quality of the constructed optimal treatment regimes while providing valid statistical inference.",Optimal dynamic treatment strategies for controlling alcohol use: novel methods for selecting and incorporating effect modifiers,9953933,R21AA027571,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcoholism', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dose', 'Exclusion', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical History', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'falls', 'genetic information', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'overtreatment', 'personalized medicine', 'repository', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'virtual']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R21,2020,185591,0.051233316278291516
"Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response PROJECT SUMMARY The growing expansion of the approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and the variable responses to MS treatment have created an unmet medical need to provide individually tailored therapy. Efforts to bring precision medicine to provide individualized MS treatment selection have been impeded by our limited understanding of the factors that determine treatment response. While genomics hold the promise for closing this knowledge gap, the insufficient number of patients with detailed treatment response data and the modest effect size of genetic variants that influence treatment responses are the main limiting factors in pharmacogenomics studies. As electronic health records (EHR) become widely adopted and increasingly standardized and as we implement sophisticated computational and statistical methods to harness the EHR data, EHR systems can become cost-effective platforms to perform large-scale treatment response studies in real-life settings. Our team with a history of productive collaborations and diverse expertise (led by PI Dr. Xia) previously developed robust algorithms to identify 5,495 MS patients from the Partners HealthCare EHR systems and then model MS disease activity in these patients using EHR data. The Partners EHR system contains longitudinal clinical information on thousands of MS patients from two large academic medical centers and is linked to a well-characterized MS patient research registry and biobanks with existing genomics data. For the proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that meaningful phenotypes of MS disease activity can be extracted from EHR data to inform treatment response, and that additional common genetic variants exist in the population and can predict therapeutic response in MS when combined with clinical features derived from EHR data. The proposed study has three aims with the overall goal to produce a computational and analytic approach capable of identifying MS disease activity in relation to treatment history using EHR data and integrate with genomics profile to develop a predictive model of therapeutic response to commonly prescribed DMTs in this cohort of 5,495 MS patients, including injectable (interferon-β, glatiramer acetate) and oral (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) options. Specifically, we will (1) leverage narrative electronic health records data (e.g., clinical notes, radiology reports) and natural language processing (NLP) to ascertain individualized response to DMTs (n=600 for each DMT); (2) Identify clinical features from electronic health record data (e.g., diagnoses, exposures) that predict response to DMTs using a systematic phenome-wide approach; (3) Develop and test a comprehensive predictive model of individualized response to DMTs that incorporates clinical and genetic predictors. This research has the potential impact to be transformative by contributing to a major knowledge gap regarding the factors that influence treatment response and bringing precision medicine closer to individualized MS treatment selection. PROJECT NARRATIVE AND PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition that affects over 400,000 individuals in the United States and creates a high socioeconomic burden as a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Because not all patients respond the same way to a specific medication, physicians and MS patients often lose precious time searching for effective treatment with serially testing of costly medications. An individually tailored treatment can ensure early start of effective medication that can prevent relapse and progression of disability. Ultimately, this project will help gain insights into the factors that determine treatment response and enable physicians to match an individual MS patient's clinical and genomic profile with uniquely tailored therapy to maximize effectiveness, delay disease progression and reduce overall cost.",Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response,9963407,R01NS098023,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Fumarates', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injectable', 'Interferon-beta', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'copolymer 1', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'individual response', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'patient response', 'phenome', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,340616,0.04333817380195944
"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment.

"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these challenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymorphisms, whole brain neuroimaging, biofluids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mechanisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Specifically, in Aim 1, we develop efficient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation models to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efficiency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-specific substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic systems through ordinary differential equations with random inflections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker profiles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efficient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individualized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest benefit from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory.

"Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy PROJECT SUMMARY The era of “big data” has opened the door for genomic and systems biology approaches to be applied to current challenges in life sciences and precision medicine. One critical challenge in these areas is how to prioritize research findings to validate and identify actionable insights that can translate into better outcomes for patients. In this regard, we have assembled a multidisciplinary group of scientists and physicians from academia and industry with a focus on creating discovery pipelines that combine high-throughput profiling technologies with advanced statistical and machine learning approaches to generate predictive tools that enable us to move rapidly from big data to better diagnoses and treatment. In this regard, we propose to apply these approaches to develop a computational clinical decision tool that will improve disease forecasting and treatment plans for Multiple Myeloma (MM), an incurable cancer that originates in bone marrow plasma cells and affects more than 30,000 patients a year. Though there have been some advances in the number and diversity of available therapeutic options for these patients, relapse remains inevitable, and MM ultimately remains a terminal diagnosis. The clinical assay and computational pipeline developed in this project will combine a targeted sequencing panel specific to myeloma patients and clonality estimates with RNA- sequencing and drug repurposing to expand therapeutic options for MM patients. We will develop this unique tool with the following specific aims: (1) Develop an integrated genomic clinical decision tool to guide precision treatment of MM and validate therapy recommendations using PDX profiling, and (2) Validate MM precision medicine platform in a prospective clinical trial and generate clone-specific treatment recommendations. To achieve these objectives, we will integrate a Cancer Genetic, Inc.'s FOCUS::Myeloma panel, a targeted panel designed to specifically interrogateall the genes and copy number alterations commonly altered in myeloma, and into a computational drug selection pipeline that utilizes RNA-sequencing data and drug repurposing algorithms to generate therapeutic recommendations matched to a patient's unique disease profile. These recommendations will be validated in mouse avatars of myeloma to confirm and refine drug predictions. We will implement our assay in a prospective clinical trial of 100 patients to determine if the treatment decisions generated by our pipeline achieves an improvement in standard-of-care. Finally, we will perform clonal modeling on relapsed patients to retrospectively evaluate clone-specific treatment responses. Completion of these studies will result in a clinic-ready assay and computational tool that will guide MM precision treatment decisions and inform new therapeutic strategies based on a patient's unique cancer profile. genomic clonal modeling PROJECT NARRATIVE Multiple Myeloma is an incurable cancer of the blood that takes the lives of over 12,000 people every year. It remains a difficult disease to treat due to its genetic complexity from the earliest stages of the disease, indicating a need for a precision medicine approach in treating these patients. In this application Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai will partner with Cancer Genetics, Inc. to develop a multi-omics clinical decision assay that will improve long-term outcomes for patients with advanced myeloma and generate valuable insights and tools that can be broadly leveraged for other disease indications.",Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy,9981389,R01CA244899,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Bone Marrow', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonality', 'Computer Models', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Employment', 'Event', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Industry', 'Inflammatory', 'Intake', 'Intestines', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Mus', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'RNA', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stream', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'cancer genetics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically actionable', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'efficacy testing', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'medical schools', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'pilot trial', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'relapse patients', 'standard of care', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'targeted sequencing', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,519735,0.0024626897660101777
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,10088013,R44AI145505,"['Adopted', 'Advocate', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Expression Profiling', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologist', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain health', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'drug efficacy', 'effective therapy', 'experimental group', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'learning classifier', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'preservation', 'response', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2020,499995,0.038867605699213624
"Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 16,870 deaths per year in the United States with 79,030 new bladder cancer cases diagnosed in 2017. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. We have successfully developed a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. A quantitative image analysis tool for bladder cancer (QIBC) that quantifies the bladder gross tumor volume (GTV) and image characteristics is an important component of CDSS-T. Advanced machine learning techniques are used to merge the GTV and radiomic biomarkers into an effective predictive model. The goal of this project is to validate the effectiveness of CDSS-T as an aid to the radiologists and the oncologists in assessment of bladder cancer change as a result of treatment through pilot clinical trials. We will (1) perform a preparatory clinical trial with the clinicians at UM, which will simulate the real prospective clinical trial with high quality retrospective data, (2) deploy the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the three collaborating clinical sites, (3) use the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the different clinical sites in the prospective pilot clinical trial (standard clinical workflow) utilizing the decision support in parallel to the standard clinical patient care, and (4) analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the clinicians' performance in the pilot clinical trial and assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. We hypothesize that this innovative approach can improve clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation and assessment of treatment response. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to evaluate the performance of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on cases not previously used, new to the system, for both the prediction accuracy and the automatic standalone functionality, refine and optimize the design of the user interface based on clinicians' feedback after their hands-on experience with the system to ensure its practicality and robustness, familiarize clinicians with the performance of the CDSS-T tools and the interpretation of the CDSS-T outputs as a part of user training for the prospective pilot clinical trial, (2) to optimize the QIBC and CDSS-T tools for the clinical workflow at the different clinical sites based on the site clinicians' feedback in order to operate efficiently and in a standalone mode by clinicians, (3) to record the clinicians' predicted outcomes without and with the use of the tools during the pilot clinical trials, estimate the accuracy of assessing response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the current clinical treatment paradigm by comparing the estimated response to the histopathologically determined response after radical cystectomy, and (4) to statistically analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the performance of the clinicians in the pilot clinical trial and statistically assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. PROJECT NARRATIVE We have previously developed a computer decision support system for (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. If successfully deployed and utilized, CDSS-T will be a useful tool to aid clinicians in improving the accuracy and reproducibility of tumor treatment response assessment. Improving the reliability in assessment of treatment response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying patients who do not respond to preserve their physical condition, thus allowing them to seek alternative treatment, which may reduce morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients suffering from bladder cancer. In addition, the multi-site pilot clinical trial will provide an excellent opportunity to experience the process of bringing laboratory research from bench to bedside, which will serve as a valuable guide for future development of clinically practical tools for various diseases.",Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer,9926229,U01CA232931,"['Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratory Research', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Cystectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'design', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,625336,-0.002540236720990401
"Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support PROJECT SUMMARY Treatments for mental health conditions such as unipolar depression provide modest average benefit but have wide variation between individuals and within individuals over time. Evidence-based customized treatment protocols would improve the mental health care of many people by providing treatment recommendations for individuals that take into account potential variation because of personal characteristics such as current health status, symptoms, and response to earlier treatment. Generating customized treatment protocols requires large amounts of data, such as from networks of health systems that can link electronic health records from millions of individuals. Current statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols are limited in three important ways.  First, current approaches rely on scientists to select the patient characteristics to use to customize treatments instead of using data to find the patient characteristics that will lead to improved, customized care. Second, customized treatment protocols discovered with current statistical methods assume no unobserved differences between individuals who receive various treatment options. Third, investigators do not have ways to know if the available data contain enough information to discover and compare customized treatment protocols precisely enough to make clinical decisions. We will address these three limitations by developing new statistical tools for discovering customized treatment protocols using electronic health records data. Our research team has expertise and experience in statistics, epidemiology, and mental health care. We will integrate methods that have been successfully used in other settings to improve statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols and address these three important limitations.  We will extend machine learning tools for selecting important pieces of information to the time-varying data structure required for discovering customized treatment protocols. We will build approaches that use available knowledge about the size of unobserved differences between groups of people who received different treatments to assess how those differences change study results. By building on the math used to estimate the sample sizes needed for precision in randomized trials with complex designs, we will develop new formulas for determining how many people with a particular condition and who took a particular drug are needed in a health system to provide enough accurate information to discover customized treatment protocols.  Using data from the electronic health records of more than 15,000 patients, we will discover customized treatment protocols for depression. By improving statistical tools and addressing current limitations, our customized treatment protocols will have immediate impact for people living with unipolar depression. The statistical tools we develop will also be useful for discovering customized treatment protocols for people with a wide variety of mental health conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE People living with mental health conditions and their health care providers often lack evidence for making choices about numerous treatment options and they do not have evidence-based, customized treatment plans. This project will develop customized treatment plans for unipolar depression and methods to generate these plans using data from electronic health care records. This work will address current limitations in statistical methods for selecting patient characteristics for customizing treatment, assessing bias from differences between people who take different medications, and calculating how many people are needed to accurately compare customized treatment plans using data from electronic health records.",Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support,9913586,R01MH114873,"['13 year old', 'Address', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sequential Treatment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical implementation', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'large scale data', 'novel', 'practice setting', 'precision medicine', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'statistics', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,372812,0.06020190366639218
"The neural bases of placebo effects and their relation to regulatory processes Placebo treatments can induce clinically significant benefits, compared with no-treatment controls, across a variety of disorders. But placebo treatments themselves are pharmacologically and physically inert: Their benefits result from active brain and psychological responses to the treatment context. Neuroscientific studies have established that placebo treatments influence cortical-subcortical brain pathways and neurochemical systems relevant for expectation, appraisals of personal and social meaning, and value-driven learning. These systems are also related to symptom progression across mental health disorders and several other neurological and substance use disorders. Understanding the brain and psychological mechanisms of placebo effects will help improve psychological and neurological (e.g., neuromodulation-based) treatments across disorders. This R01 renewal funds an ongoing program of research that has made fundamental contributions to this literature. It has also identified several significant gaps that are particularly important for connecting placebo research to mental health. One gap is that our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects comes almost purely from studies of pain. The proposed studies extend previous work to study the brain pathways underlying placebo effects in anxiety and social rejection, negative affective processes directly relevant for multiple mental health disorders. Pattern-recognition (machine learning) analyses identify the most symptom-relevant pathways, and test effects of placebo and other context interventions on these pathways. In Aim 1 (Experiments 1-3), we develop models across multiple affective symptoms, parsing affective pathways into those that are symptom-specific and those that generalize across multiple symptoms and outcomes. We also address the role of endogenous opioids, strongly linked to placebo analgesia, in other negative affective experiences. Another gap is that most previous studies of the context variables that drive strong placebo effects—including social influences, treatment history—have not been studied extensively at the brain level. In Aim 2, we study the brain pathways underlying several promising context interventions that enhance the strength of placebo effects, including social modeling of successful or unsuccessful treatment response, initial experiences of treatment success or failure, and the match between placebo suggestions and a person’s predisposition to be receptive to them. Project narrative Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo treatments induce active neurobiological processes related to patients’ expectations, learned associations, perceived care and support, and hope for the future. Studying placebo treatments provides a window into these crucial context variables that will help understand vulnerability and resilience to mental health disorders and beyond. This project continues a successful program of research on the brain mechanisms of placebo effects, taking the work in new directions critical for understanding mental health.",The neural bases of placebo effects and their relation to regulatory processes,9842001,R01MH076136,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Alcohols', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Conceptions', 'Deception', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Expectancy', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Masks', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Naloxone', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiology', 'Placebo Effect', 'Placebos', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taste Perception', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wages', 'Work', 'active method', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'endogenous opioids', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'gastrointestinal function', 'improved', 'negative affect', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'patient expectation', 'placebo analgesia', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'social', 'social interventions', 'social model', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2020,797673,0.00240992732992088
"Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality, clinical impairment, and comorbid psychopathology. Although evidence-based treatments for EDs have been established, the treatment gap is wide. Indeed, <20% of individuals with EDs receive treatment. We need a novel solution not only to identify individuals with EDs but also to encourage mental health services use and address treatment barriers. I have established a strong working relationship with the National EDs Association (NEDA), the U.S.'s leading non-profit for EDs, to offer our group's online, evidence-based EDs screen on the NEDA website. Over one year, the NEDA screen was completed >200,000 times. Among screen respondents, the vast majority screen positive for an ED, but of those, most are not in treatment, and only a small percentage click to learn more about one of the options for seeking intervention presented in the screening feedback. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” that is optimized to increase mental health services use among individuals with EDs through such features as: 1) providing a personalized recommendation for seeking intervention; 2) engaging the user in motivational interviewing to overcome barriers to care; and 3) repeated check-ins with the user to encourage follow-up with care. This research agenda aligns with NIMH's focus on services research and interest in technology-driven approaches to promote engagement with care. I will conduct two studies. First, I will utilize a user-centered design approach to create a prototype chatbot and conduct usability testing with adults with EDs to inform chatbot refinements (Aim 1). Second, I will conduct a randomized optimization trial with adults who have completed screening on the NEDA website and screen positive for an ED but are not in treatment to determine chatbot feasibility and to generate data on the effect of the chatbot on motivation for treatment post-initial chatbot use and motivation for treatment and mental health services use at 1- and 3-month follow-ups (Aims 2 & 3). This trial will employ the Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework, using a 23 full factorial design, to randomly assign participants to a combination of the three proposed intervention components (n=8 conditions) to isolate the active ingredients. These aims support my training plan in which I will receive expert mentorship and training in: services research and implementation science (Training Goal 1); user-centered design and usability testing, as well as exposure to machine learning (Training Goal 2); novel trial designs (Training Goal 3); and advanced statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal trial and digital innovation data (Training Goal 4). My expert mentorship team, along with the environment of Washington University, will ensure my success. Results from the proposed study will be used to optimize the chatbot, which I will then test in a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will equip me with the skills to become a leader in addressing the research-practice and treatment gaps for EDs, with a focus on digital innovations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses, but less than 20% of individuals receive treatment. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” for increasing mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders, with study data being used to optimize the chatbot for a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will not only result in the development of a highly scalable solution for facilitating mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders that has potential for widespread dissemination through partnership with the National Eating Disorders Association, but it will also result in an independent research program that addresses critical gaps in the treatment of eating disorders, with a focus on digital innovation solutions.","Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders",9955368,K08MH120341,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exposure to', 'Facebook', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Participant', 'Partnership Practice', 'Psychopathology', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Services', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'chatbot', 'comorbidity', 'computer program', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health service use', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'multiphase optimization strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'service delivery', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'success', 'trial design', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'web site']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,179096,-0.005633563288909888
"Development of personalized ex vivo predictive technology for rapidly matching patient tumors with chemotherapy regimens before treatment. Project Summary/Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the deadliest cancers with <9% five-year survival rate and an estimated 60,000 deaths/year by 2030. PDAC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage thereby precluding surgical resection for most patients. While new systemic therapy regimens have improved survival, availability of multiple options, without tools to select an optimal regimen from these (on an individualized basis), has created a frustrating paradox in clinical decision-making. Due to a lack of personalized predictive tools, current standard of care treatment strategy is based on prognostic factors such as age, stage, performance status, serum albumin, etc. There is a critical, urgent and unmet need to develop predictive tools that can identify optimal systemic therapy regimens and eliminate from consideration ineffective options, on an individualized basis, to improve quality of life and reduce overtreatment. CerFlux, Inc. is developing such predictive technology with its low-cost and rapid Personalized Oncology Efficacy Test (POET) to match each patient with the right treatment – before treatment – to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a difference in the lives of patients and providers around the world. Our personalized medicine approach is unique and further enhanced by a commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the O’Neil Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The proposed project will build on recent work by our team including a patented (US 10,114,010B1) biomimetic in vitro platform for pharmacological transport and pancreatic microtissue tumor models. The commercial goal of this proposal is to identify best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. Our hypothesis is that response to treatment observed in POET will approximate the response in the corresponding patient. Our objective is to predict both effective and ineffective treatments for each patient prior to initiating treatment. We propose the following aims to achieve our objective: Aim 1: Calibrate and optimize POET for evaluating therapeutics using human PDAC cell-line xenografts for subsequent testing with patient tissue. Aim 2: Evaluate efficacy of various systemic therapy agents in POET on an individualized basis to establish protocols and best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. We envision substantial continuing commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the O’Neil Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham including the integration of machine learning to derive a “POET Score” – a personalized quantitative efficacy score – based on a combination of factors. Data from POET and the POET Score will help clinical teams rank treatments for individual patients before the first drug infusion. If successful, this SBIR-driven study has the potential to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a positive impact around the world. Project Narrative Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the deadliest cancers with <9% five-year survival rate, is often diagnosed at an advanced stage thereby precluding surgical resection for most patients. There is a critical, urgent and unmet need to develop predictive tools that can identify optimal systemic therapy regimens and eliminate from consideration ineffective options on an individualized basis to improve quality of life and reduce overtreatment. CerFlux, Inc. is developing such predictive technology with its low-cost and rapid Personalized Oncology Efficacy Test (POET) to match each patient with the right treatment – before treatment – to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a difference in the lives of patients and providers around the world.",Development of personalized ex vivo predictive technology for rapidly matching patient tumors with chemotherapy regimens before treatment.,10080473,R43CA254493,"['Age', 'Alabama', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biomimetics', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Infusion procedures', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pain', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Patient Rights', 'Patients', 'Performance Status', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Preparation', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Regimen', 'Right to Treatments', 'Serum Albumin', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specimen', 'Surface Properties', 'Survival Rate', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically translatable', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'drug testing', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy testing', 'human tissue', 'image processing', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'ineffective therapies', 'overtreatment', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'precision oncology', 'predictive test', 'predictive tools', 'response', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tissue culture', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,"CERFLUX, INC.",R43,2020,249148,0.016653118593756108
"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary/Abstract  Current medical treatment guidelines largely rely on data from randomized controlled trials that study  average effects, which may be inadequate for making individualized decisions for real-world patients. Large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) data provide unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized treatment strategies and generate evidence relevant to real-world patients. However, there are inherent challenges in the use of EHRs, including non-experimental nature of data collection processes, heterogeneous data types with complex dependencies, irregular measurement patterns, multiple dynamic treatment sequences, and the need to balance risk and benefit of treatments. Using two high-quality EHR databases, Columbia University Medical Center's clinical data warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care database, and focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D), this proposal will develop novel and scalable statistical learning approaches that overcome these challenges to discover optimal personalized treatment strategies for T2D from real-world patients. Specifically, under Aim 1, we will develop a unified framework to learn latent temporal processes for feature extraction and dynamic patient records representation. Our approach will accommodate large-scale variables of mixed types (continuous, binary, counts) measured at irregular intervals. They extract lower-dimensional components to reflect patients' dynamic health status, account for informative healthcare documentation processes, and characterize similarities between patients. Under Aim 2, we will develop fast and efficient multi-category machine learning methods, in order to evaluate treatment propensities and adaptively learn optimal dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) among the extensive number of treatment options observed in the EHRs. The methods will provide  sequential decisions that determine the best treatment sequence for a T2D patient given his/her EHRs. Under Aim 3, we will develop statistical learning methods to assist multi-faceted treatment decision-making, which balances risks versus benefits when evaluating a DTR. Our approach will ensure maximizing benefit to the greatest extent while controlling all risk outcomes under the safety margins. For all aims, we will develop efficient stochastic resampling algorithms to scale up the optimization for massive data sizes. We will identify optimal DTRs for T2D using the extracted information from patients' comorbidity conditions, medications, and laboratory tests, as well as records-collection processes. Our methodologies will be applied and cross-validated between the two EHR databases. The treatment strategies learned from the representative EHR databases with a diverse patient  population will be beneficial for individual patient care, assisting clinicians to adaptively choose the optimal treatment for a patient. Finally, we will disseminate our methods and results through freely available software and outreach to the informatics and clinical experts at our Centers for Translational Science and elsewhere. Project Narrative  This proposal aims to develop novel and scalable statistical learning methods to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) and use two real-world, high-quality EHR databases for personalized medicine research. The methods will handle the non-experimental nature of data collection processes, along with heterogeneous data types, dynamic treatment sequences, and the trade-off between benefit and risk outcomes. The results will complement the current knowledge base for individual patient care using evidence generated from patients in real-world clinical practices.",Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data,9891071,R01GM124104,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Categories', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Formulation', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Indiana', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'adaptive learning', 'adverse event risk', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'complex data ', 'data modeling', 'data space', 'design', 'evidence base', 'feature extraction', 'heterogenous data', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outreach', 'patient population', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'scale up', 'statistical learning', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,328853,0.03407112317725937
"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes. This project aims to improve exposure therapy response for patients with social anxiety disorder by directly linking exposure therapy response to the neurobiology of extinction learning.",Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory,9904774,K23MH113708,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Dorsal', 'Exposure to', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Severities', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient response', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'statistics', 'theories', 'treatment of anxiety disorders']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,186408,0.009317597803977885
"2/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric diorders Abstract  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly heritable, debilitating diseases with lifetime prevalences of ~1% and 15%, respectively. Both disorders carry substantial morbidity and mortality and are associated with severe societal and personal costs. Despite the availability of efficacious treatments for both disorders, ~1/3 of individuals will not achieve symptomatic improvement even after multiple rounds of medication. Identifying individuals at greater risk for such treatment nonresponse, or treatment resistance, could facilitate more targeted interventions for these individuals.  A burgeoning literature has identified genomic variation associated with treatment response. In particular, antidepressant response has been suggested to be highly heritable; convergent data from rodent studies likewise suggest that antipsychotic and antidepressant response phenotypes are influenced by genetic variation. However, treatment studies to date have had minimal success in identifying variants associated with psychotropic response, likely as a result of limited sample sizes: prior efforts required sequential treatment trials and prospective assessment to characterize outcomes. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) data provide an opportunity to efficiently characterize treatment response in many individuals in real-world settings. Coupled with large and expanding biobanks, these cohorts allow for low- cost, large-scale genomic studies that finally achieve sufficient power to detect realistic effect sizes.  The investigators now propose to apply these approaches to the EHRs of two large regional health systems, each linked to a large biobank, to investigate treatment resistance in SCZ and MDD. They will apply canonical indicators of treatment resistance - clozapine treatment for SCZ, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for MDD - to identify coded and uncoded clinical features associated with high probability of treatment resistance in EHR data. These predictors will themselves provide a useful baseline for identifying high risk individuals. Then, they will apply these to study the entire affected population of each biobank, extending existing genomic data with additional genome-wide association, yielding more than 25,000 antidepressant-treated individuals and 2,200 antipsychotic-treated individuals. Rather than simply conducting a case-control study, they will examine treatment resistance as a quantitative trait, applying a method developed by the investigators and shown to substantially increase power for such traits.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and analysis of large scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in psychiatric treatment resistance. Spanning two distinct health systems, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next- step investigations. Successful identification of risk variants will facilitate efforts at clinical risk stratification as well as investigation of the biology underlying treatment resistance. Public Health Statement Despite the availability of effective treatments for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, around 1/3 of individuals will not have symptomatic improvement after multiple treatment trials. If individuals at high risk for treatment resistance could be identified early, it might be possible to find more effective treatments for them.

"Computerized detection and internet-based treatment of common mental disorders among college students in two Latin American LMICs PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Objectives: This proposal is submitted in response to PAR-18-835 to detect, engage, and experimentally evaluate the effects of internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (e-CBT) to treat college students in two Latin American LMICs with major depressive disorder and/or generalized anxiety disorder w/ or w/o comorbid common mental disorders (CMDs). Detection and engagement will be based on inexpensive internet-based self-report surveys and the intervention on inexpensive e-CBT to address the low resources in LMICs. Knowledge transfer to the primary LMIC collaborating institution (Mexican National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente Muniz [INPRFM]) will be a goal designed to facilitate dissemination to LMIC colleges/universities throughout Latin America. The study will build on prior research by collaborators in the WHO World Mental Health (WMH) survey consortium and WMH International College Study (WMH-ICS) initiative documenting high prevalence, impairment, and unmet need for treatment of CMDs among college students around the world and significant effects of e-CBT in treating these disorders in high income countries. Specific aims/Design/Methods: First, we will carry out a pragmatic clinical trial with students seeking treatment for CMDs at student clinics in four universities in Colombia and Mexico. Students on waitlists for student clinic services will be offered a possibility of receiving guided e-CBT immediately while staying on the list. 50% of the students with CMD who express interest will be randomized to guided e-CBT and the other 50% to treatment as usual (TAU). Short-term aggregate intervention effects will be assessed 60 days after randomization and longer-term effects 12 months after randomization. We will then use ensemble machine learning methods to predict heterogeneity of treatment effects of guided e-CBT versus TAU and develop a precision treatment rule (PTR) to predict which students will respond best to which intervention. We will then implement a SMART design in which we randomize 50% to the treatment arm predicted to be optimal by the PTR and the other 50% to randomization across arms. Additionally, we will carry out annual WMH-ICS internet-based mental health needs assessment surveys with a probability sample of students to estimate unmet need for treatment and barriers to treatment. Students screening positive for CMD who are not in treatment and report resistance to in-person treatment will be randomized to guided e-CBT to determine if access to guided e-CBT reduces the unmet need for treatment among students with CMDs who fail to seek treatment at student health clinics. Finally, the technology for screening, delivering e-CBT, and updating the precision treatment model, implemented initially by Harvard Medical School, will be transferred to INPRFM for dissemination to universities in LMICs throughout Latin America. That many senior regional mental health policy makers are trained at INPRFM and return for periodic policy summits, coupled with the close working relationship of INPRFM with the Pan American Health Organization, bode well for such dissemination efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE The research will provide valuable information to school administrators and government policy makers in the participating LMICs to document the burden of CMDs among university students, the extent of unmet need for treatment of these disorders, the effectiveness of inexpensive-scalable e-CBT interventions to treat these disorders, and for whom e-CBT is most effective. The technology transfer part of the study will build capacity to disseminate the methods used for screening, targeting, and intervention implementation so that they can be used in colleges and universities in LMICs throughout Latin America. Such an effort could have enormous public health implications for the region and serve as a model of evidence-based intervention planning and implementation for other parts of the world.",Computerized detection and internet-based treatment of common mental disorders among college students in two Latin American LMICs,10053143,R01MH120648,"['Address', 'Administrator', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Colombia', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Surveys', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Latin America', 'Latin American', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Needs Assessment', 'Pan American Health Organization', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Probability Samples', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial', 'Services', 'Students', 'Suicide', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'arm', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'college', 'common treatment', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'nervous system disorder', 'outreach', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'symposium', 'treatment arm', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trial design', 'undergraduate student', 'university student']",NIMH,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PSYCHIATRY,R01,2020,10000,0.01934586109231635
"Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: Dr. Strom received an MD from Harvard Medical School (HMS), and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (BIDMC), and non-invasive cardiac imaging (BIDMC). Additionally, he completed an MSc in Epidemiology program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in May, 2018. He is now a junior faculty member at BIDMC with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. Through this proposed 5-year program, Dr. Strom will pursue additional training in advanced prediction modeling, machine learning, patient-oriented research, and metabolomics. The candidate’s long- term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the area of applied outcomes research. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Robert W. Yeh (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Director of the Smith Center for Outcomes Research in Cardiology, Robert E. Gerszten (Co-Mentor), Professor of Medicine at HMS and Chief of Cardiovascular Medicine at BIDMC, and Changyu Shen (Co-Mentor), upcoming Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Lead Biostatistician for the Smith Center. Dr. Yeh has a track record of leading practice-changing studies and successful mentorship of clinician investigators. Dr. Gerszten is an internationally recognized expert in molecular phenotyping of cardiovascular diseases using metabolomics and proteomics and has mentored several K-award and R01 funded clinical investigators. Dr. Shen has a long track record of NIH funding, expertise in evaluating heterogeneity of treatment effect in cardiovascular diseases, and has mentored multiple prior trainees. Research: The optimal therapy for a given individual with aortic stenosis remains uncertain. This proposal seeks to define the clinical and biologic components of frailty that modify risk after aortic valve replacement (AVR) and alter treatment benefit. For Aims 1-2, we will leverage the unique linkage of Medicare data to the US CoreValve Pivotal trials, a collection of clinical trials that randomized individuals with severe aortic stenosis to transcatheter AVR (TAVR) with a self-expanding bioprosthesis vs. surgical AVR (SAVR). In Aim 1, we will we will identify which variables, related to in-person assessments of frailty and candidate frailty codes, best predict adverse outcomes after AVR. In Aim 2, we will identify if novel variables identified in Aim 1, identify a heterogeneous treatment response in individuals undergoing AVR. In Aim 3, we will prospectively enroll patients undergoing TAVR at BIDMC with concurrent frailty phenotyping to identify whether metabolites associated with longevity correlate with frailty and predict adverse outcomes, independent of age and comorbidities. The research will identify the mechanisms by which frailty confers adverse risk and differential treatment benefit in AVR, providing insights that may personalize treatment selection and improve patient care. PROJECT NARRATIVE While new technologies have permitted the use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis, which is fatal without treatment, deciding on the optimal treatment for a given patient is often difficult, especially as these decisions are often made towards the end of life and there are significant risks concomitant with each treatment. In this setting, frailty, a state of debility that impairs recovery from illness, has emerged as a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes but the mechanisms by which frailty confers risk and the components of frailty that are most important are unknown. In this proposal, we seek to define the clinical and biological components of frailty that contribute risk in aortic valve replacement using a combination of novel data sources and methodologic techniques, including linkage of clinical trials to administrative data, machine learning, and metabolite profiling, in order to personalize treatments and optimize patient health and medical decision making.",Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling,9969556,K23HL144907,"['Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bioprosthesis device', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronology', 'Citric Acid Cycle', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Israel', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physician Executives', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'adverse event risk', 'adverse outcome', 'aortic valve replacement', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'end of life', 'frailty', 'health data', 'health service use', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'mid-career faculty', 'minimally invasive', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'optimal treatments', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'surgical risk', 'treatment effect', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2020,172800,0.026431341707801016
"Generalizable biomedical informatics strategies for predictive modeling of treatment response Identification of patients with poor and favorable treatment response prior to therapy administration is invaluable for improving patient survival and disease management. We propose to build an open-source scalable generalizable method that would assist experimentalists and clinicians on assessing patient's risk of developing therapy resistance and would establish a foundation for our long-term goal to build a platform for patient-centric clinical decision making, personalized therapeutic advice, and disease management.  We propose to develop a generalizable versatile bioinformatics paradigm that will use patient molecular profiles to PREDICT their Therapy Response, PREDICTTR, which combines network analysis, statistical modeling, and ensemble machine learning in a unique innovative way that allows accurate elucidation of complex multi-level relationships that govern treatment response. The objective of our proposed approach is two-fold: (i) uncover molecular markers and valuable candidates for therapeutic intervention, which can potentially be targeted to preclude or overcome resistance; and (ii) predict patient's response to therapy administration, which holds a long-term promise to improve disease outcome and reduce the cost of unnecessary and ineffective treatments.  Motivated by increasing cases of treatment resistance in oncology, we will apply our algorithm to elucidate (i) response to androgen targeting in prostate cancer and (ii) response to standard-of-care chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia. We will disseminate our approach through a web-based decision- making tool, which will be implemented through a Hadoop-oriented solution to (i) broaden its practical impact and (ii) establish clinical utility. Taken together, this multi-task resource is a unique innovative effort of its kind in the therapeutic resistance space with a direct broad impact on personalized therapeutic advice and disease management. Even though we will train our model in prostate cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, our approach can be easily and broadly applicable to other therapies and diseases.  This effort will be led by an Early Stage Investigator, Antonina Mitrofanova (PI) who has extensive training and expertise in biomedical informatics and big data analytics. Her collaborative team includes Dr. Shantenu Jha (Rutgers, co-I) who is an expert in distributed systems and will advise on Hadoop development and validation; Dr. Shridar Ganesan (Rutgers, co-I) who will provide clinical and sequencing patient data and incorporate the utilization of our method into the Rutgers CINJ Molecular Tumor Board; Dr. Isaac Kim (Rutgers, co-I) who will provide additional data for validation in prostate cancer; Dr. Christopher Hourigan (NHLBI , NIH, Significant Collaborator), who will provide data for clinical validation in acute myeloid leukemia and is committed to test our web-based portal; and Dr. Scott Parrott (Rutgers, co-I), who is an expert in statistical analysis and will consult on power calculations and multiple testing corrections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identification of patients with poor and favorable treatment response prior to therapy administration is invaluable for improving patient survival and disease management. This proposal is dedicated to developing novel biomedical informatics paradigm to uncover genomic and transcriptomic mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and predict patients at risk of treatment failure, which will be shared with a wide scientific community through an open-source web-based portal. We utilize resistance to androgen-deprivation and second- generation anti-androgens in prostate cancer and resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia as our training examples, yet our paradigm can be broadly generalizable to study resistance to various therapeutic regimens and across different diseases.",Generalizable biomedical informatics strategies for predictive modeling of treatment response,10117702,R01LM013236,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Androgen Antagonists', 'Androgens', 'Atlases', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cancer Institute of New Jersey', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distributed Systems', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Oncology', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prostate Adenocarcinoma', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translations', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor stage', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'androgen deprivation therapy', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genome', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical sequencing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'ineffective therapies', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'multitask', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient response', 'personalized therapeutic', 'predictive modeling', 'profiles in patients', 'response', 'standard of care', 'statistical learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapy development', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'unnecessary treatment', 'web portal']",NLM,RBHS-SCHOOL/ HEALTH RELATED PROFESSIONS,R01,2020,323986,-0.06380590715124172
"Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients ABSTRACT  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder that likely involves multiple underlying pathological mechanisms, which has plagued attempts to identify rational therapeutic targets. All available antipsychotic drugs (APD) are dopamine receptor antagonists, but clinical response is variable, with a third of patients being partial responders, and a third non-responders. Arguably, those who respond well to APD have primarily dopaminergic abnormalities but it is imperative to also characterize the specific underlying pathologies in those with poor response in order to unravel the heterogeneity of psychosis and effectively develop new treatments. We propose to longitudinally follow treatment response to APD for eight months in medication-naïve first episode psychosis (FEP) subjects using complementary brain imaging techniques.  We already have identified provisional markers for several different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychosis, including abnormalities in glutamate, brain connectivity, and neurodevelopment that we can track with brain imaging. In addition, we propose to study the changes that occur in the brain in early compared to delayed treatment responders and changes that occur over time in response to treatment. By characterizing treatment trajectories and their relationship to baseline pathophysiologic alterations, we will further complement our mechanistic understanding of the heterogeneity of psychosis.  We propose to study 60 well-characterized FEP subjects who are medication naïve and treat them with the most frequently used APD for 32 weeks. We will follow a rigorous longitudinal design to capture treatment response whereby those without an adequate response after 16 weeks of treatment will be switched to another APD for 16 weeks. All patients will be scanned four times: at baseline and after 6, 16, and 32 weeks of treatment. We will use (1) proton MR Spectroscopy (MRS), (2) task and resting state functional MRI and (3) MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to measure brain biochemistry, function and structure. Using several imaging modalities has the potential to interrogate different neurobiological aspects of treatment response and will offer greater opportunities for clustering the patterns and combinations of the underlying pathologies in those with poor response.  Deconstructing the heterogeneity of psychosis has broad implications for the identification of specific targets for drug development, and to lay the groundwork needed to conduct therapeutic trials on patients characterized by their specific underlying psychopathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder and present treatment only works for a limited number of patients. In order to identify new therapeutic targets, we will longitudinally characterize the underlying pathologies in those with poor treatment response using complimentary brain imaging modalities.",Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients,9840512,R01MH113800,"['Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Biochemistry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine Antagonists', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Protons', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Risperidone', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'aripiprazole', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain abnormalities', 'cingulate cortex', 'drug development', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'longitudinal design', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'new therapeutic target', 'patient subsets', 'response', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2020,816340,0.026619623694606843
"Improving Outcomes Assessment in Chronic Graft versus Host Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure many hematologic cancers and other life- threatening hematologic diseases but 20-50% of survivors develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant survivors. Chronic GVHD is an iatrogenic complication that can affect multiple organs, leading to clinical manifestations similar to autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, and lichen planus. Chronic GVHD requires prolonged treatment with potent immunosuppressive agents and is associated with high symptom burden and poor quality of life. The precise pathophysiology is unclear in humans. There are data supporting involvement of T and B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cytokines, chemokines and other proteins. However, information is derived from studies with few patients having heterogeneous clinical manifestations. This renewal application will address key gaps in our understanding: Can we identify biologically relevant cGVHD subgroups by studying large numbers of patients and using sophisticated analytic techniques to identify “clusters” of similar patients? Is personalized medicine possible based on knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and the likelihood of response? To address these questions, we will use our extensive biorepository to test whether plasma proteins and peripheral blood cellular populations cluster with clinical manifestations. While these studies are ongoing, a new cohort will be enrolled to prospectively test the cluster findings and to investigate early biomarkers for treatment response. Participants will be enrolled prior to starting a new systemic initial or second-line cGVHD treatment, then followed at 1, 3 and 6 months later to assess clinical response. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of the different forms of human cGVHD and guide therapeutic approaches, in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this common transplant complication. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and non-relapse mortality in survivors of allogeneic transplantation. Our understanding of the biologic abnormalities associated with different clinical phenotypes is lacking, preventing our ability to rationally choose cGVHD treatments.

"Combining Voice and Genetic Information to Detect Heterogeneity in Major Depressive Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY This application aims to advance our understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD) by combining genetic information and analyzing speech patterns of those with MDD to identify subtypes. MDD is the leading cause of disability throughout the world, yet, relative to other common disorders, less is known about its origins. There are less effective treatments and much less is spent on trying to understand how it arises and how to cure it. Current treatments are relatively ineffective, with up 50% of patients refractory and many suffering severe recurrence. Understanding the mechanisms underlying MDD has been recognized as a grand challenge in global mental health. Thus, developing new treatments for MDD is a major priority for public health. A major challenge for MDD research is the presence of heterogeneity. The existence of multiple subtypes of MDD has been suspected for a long time, and likely confounds the ability to treat the disorder appropriately with existing treatments, as well as making it hard to identify the causes of MDD as a prelude to developing new treatments. However finding subtypes has been hard. Given that the way people talk can reflect alterations in mood, we expect voice to be able to predict mood, and hence potentially be used as biomarker to recognize heterogeneity. In preliminary data show that in combination with genetic data high-dimensional vocal features extracted from recordings can be used to identify subtypes. Furthermore, the use of genetic data allows us to impute voice features into large biobanks where no recordings exist, making it possible to explore the relationship between vocal features and a rich array of clinically important indicators. We explore the power of voice to make a diagnosis of MDD, to predict severity and other clinical features. Applying our approach to will inform clinical management, improving diagnosis, refine treatment and aid the development of new treatments PROJECT NARRATIVE The research proposed here will contribute to an understanding of major depressive disorder, the commonest psychiatric disorder and a leading cause of disability throughout the world. The proposal will combine information from voice recordings and genetics to identify subtypes of depression and develop robust predictors of mood, severity of illness and other clinical indicators.

"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions.

"Wound management through quantitative documentation and prediction Project Summary:  We propose in this SBIR effort to develop a mobile health software system for clinicians to conveniently and/or remotely manage and quantitatively document the healing process of chronic ulcers such as diabetic foot ulcers. Timely, frequent, and accurate documentation on wound appearance and dimension is vital for the growth assessment and tracking of treatment effectiveness. However, current practice is subjective, inconsistent, and even invasive. The absence of easily accessible, repeatable, and quantitative data affects care coordination among the medical staffs and handicaps the best treatment planning for individual patients. For chronic wound sufferers, countless routine visits and the ever increasing high treatment costs also hinders their chance of timely treatment and urgently calls for a convenient alternative.  Built on a seamlessly integrated client-server framework, the proposed management software allows clinicians to easily exchange wound data with the cloud server, analyze the wound healing information, and manage patient's treatment. Together with potentially other wound sensor data, our software system offers objective and quantitative assessment on wound tissue healing status, avoiding misinterpretation or inconsistent grading among medical staffers. With large patient data to be collected, the proposed software is perceived to assist clinicians with evidence based healing prediction and more effective personalized treatment planning.  Every year, approximately 6.5 million Americans suffer from chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, and venous stasis ulcers. The number is projected to grow rapidly due to the aging baby boomer population and a sharp rise in diabetes and obesity. Chronic wound healing is a lengthy process with months or even years of treatment time. Absence of personalized attention could easily cause infections and complications, leading to loss of limb. Evidence suggests that 80% of amputations are actually preventable through access of good quality and routine care. With the ever increasing high healthcare costs and the likelihood of early discharge to home care, patients are highly vulnerable to complications due to the lack of routine checkup or personalized care. All of these validates the urgent need of an alternative, convenient, and low cost clinical practice as what our mobile health app is able to provide. Project Narrative  The proposed mobile health software system to be developed under this SBIR project will provide clinicians a convenient yet comprehensive diagnosis and treatment tool, empowering them to provide personalized and timely care for chronic ulcer sufferers. With its unique client-server framework and many advantages over existing standard of care, the proposed management system will have a reasonably large market share in this rapidly growing multi-billion dollar industry.

"Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data PROJECT SUMMARY This study will leverage large-scale clinical data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to identify existing pharmaceutical agents commonly prescribed for a multitude of indications that are incidentally associated with improvements in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Through prior efforts, a data source containing almost 20 years of treatment data on all (over one million) VA users diagnosed with PTSD between October 1999 and February 2018 has been constructed, including a complete historical record of their evidence-based medication and psychotherapy receipt within the VA healthcare system. Importantly, the team has also amassed symptom-level patient-reported PTSD outcome data for hundreds of thousands of these patients. The existing data is a powerful resource with which the research team proposes to explore the following specific aims: (1) identify off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms over time; (2) further evaluate the clinical effectiveness of newly-identified off-label pharmaceutical agents for improvement in PTSD symptoms using rigorous causal methods; and (3) identify common adverse events related to off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms in this complex, psychiatrically and medically ill population The proposed project will identify agents that may merit further rigorous clinical evaluation for psychiatric benefit. New therapeutic targets may be identified that will lead to greater treatment options or specific treatments. Further, identification of off-label medications that improve or have contraindicated effects for psychiatric populations will provide critical guidance to practicing clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, there are few psychopharmacologic treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and available medications do not work sufficiently. In a recent published statement, NIMH noted that “The National Institute of Mental Health would relish the chance to partner with our VA colleagues to exploit [VA data] with the aim of providing guidelines for evidence-based pharmacotherapy for those suffering from PTSD, Veterans and civilians alike.” The proposed study was specifically designed in response to that call; it will use exploratory methods to identify off-label medications that are effective for the treatment of PTSD using a large VA medical records-based dataset.",Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data,9858600,R01MH121397,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fluoxetine', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Paroxetine', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Scanning', 'Sertraline', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Veterans', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-label drug', 'prospective', 'psychopharmacologic', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy development', 'treatment guidelines', 'venlafaxine', 'working group']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,648991,0.02418871256640625
"Advancing the Measurement and Classification of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S. adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making. Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated, and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380 participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes researchers.

"Quantifying Microbial Keratitis to Predict Outcomes: An Imaging and Epidemiologic Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT For epidemiological studies, future clinical trials, and personalized patient care, there is a critical need to create a risk-stratification system for microbial keratitis. Microbial keratitis (MK), a debilitating, infectious corneal disease, is estimated to be the fourth-leading cause of blindness worldwide. MK severity depends on a complex interaction of patient, organism, and environment, resulting in a spectrum of clinical presentations and responses to treatment. Clinical presentations manifest with unique morphology features and clinical symptoms. Morphology features are visible in the cornea, and symptoms are measurable. But most patients are treated with non-specific broad-spectrum antimicrobials, an approach that increases antimicrobial resistance. This non-specific treatment approach lacks congruence with the unique MK presentations. There is a critical need for a new strategy to personalize treatments for MK and measure treatment efficacy. With quantified MK morphologic and clinical features, clinicians will have the tools to risk-stratify patients. The long-term goal is to develop rapid, objective, personalized treatment plans for patients with MK. This proposal’s objective is to quantify dynamic morphologic and clinical MK features using image and electronic health record (EHR) analyses and then build a risk-stratification scoring system associated with MK outcomes. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that morphologic and clinical features accurately risk- stratify patients for corneal and vision outcomes. Our premise is supported by preliminary data demonstrating that: (1) different organisms generate distinct morphologic and clinical features; (2) clinicians quantify morphology less precisely than image-analysis methods, (3) an expert is able to use MK features to tailor treatments; (4) the use of quantified features has improved outcomes in other diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, by helping providers to tailor treatments; (5) EHR data can be used to quantify and classify clinical disease features accurately; and (6) EHR data can be used effectively to risk-stratify patients. Aim 1 will develop objective image analysis tools to measure features of MK with existing clinical equipment. Aim 2 will evaluate MK treatment efficacy using morphologic image analysis and clinical features from prospective surveys. Aim 3 will risk-stratify patients with MK by combining image analysis and EHR extracted data. The expected outcomes are: (1) characterized databases of MK images and linked clinical data, (2) quantified MK features across a spectrum of clinical presentations, (3) performance-tested, open-source imaging algorithms and surveys to measure MK markers dynamically, and (4) a novel risk stratification model and scoring system. The resultant work will have significant value to clinicians. Clinicians can use practical, low-cost technologies and readily-available EHR data to quantify MK features and risk-stratify patients in order to tailor treatments. NARRATIVE The clinical management of microbial keratitis is imprecise and dependent on the expertise of the treating physician. Our innovative strategies will quantify corneal features using image analysis and available clinical data from the electronic health record. Quantified image features will be linked to health outcomes to give physicians new tools to risk-stratify patients and to tailor their management to optimize outcomes.",Quantifying Microbial Keratitis to Predict Outcomes: An Imaging and Epidemiologic Approach,9865483,R01EY031033,"['Algorithms', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Blindness', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inflammatory', 'Keratitis', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Eye Institute', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Self-Examination', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Virulence', 'Vision', 'Visual Acuity', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'care systems', 'case control', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'epidemiology study', 'healing', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'performance tests', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'slit lamp imaging', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,410000,0.018363889323354893
"Development and Validation of a Collaborative Web/Cloud-Based Dosimetry System for Radiopharmaceutical Therapy. Project Summary  Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) – the use of targeted radionuclides to deliver radiation specifically to cancer cells and their microenvironment – is a fundamentally different approach to cancer therapy that is growing, with a substantial number of large and small pharmaceuticals companies developing products in this area and radionuclide producers making substantial investments in scaling up production. This is especially true in the area of alpha emitters. The dosimetric evaluation of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals is a key requirement for regulatory approval and optimal administration of RPTs, especially in combination with external beam radiation therapy. This project will provide a cloud-based dosimetry software service, delivered through a web-browser, that includes the full complement of methods needed for dosimetry in the context of obtaining regulatory approval of RPTs and, ultimately, for optimal clinical delivery. Providing this in a cloud-based system will enable a variety of models for selling the service that do not require a large up-front capital investment for clinics or radiopharmaceutical developers. It also will provide access to expert advice, customization, and dosimetry services, and allow for collaboration between developers, dosimetry experts, and clinical sites. To accomplish the goal of developing this cloud-based web-browser-delivered RPT dosimetry software service, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Design, develop and implement a web/cloud-based integrated software system for treatment planning of RPT therapy; (2) design and implement a full server-side framework for subscription, authentication, and granting collaborative privileges for the various processes and data in the dosimetry pipeline; (3) optimize and adapt the four most computationally intensive processes for a multi-processor cloud-based compute environment; (4) apply and evaluate the toolchain developed in aims 1-3 to phantom, simulated and existing patient data. Successful completion of this project will produce a cloud-based software system delivered to the user via a web browser that provides an integrated, streamlined, robust, state-of-the-art system for RPT treatment planning. This system would enable a collaborative approach to multi-center clinical trials and eventually to clinical delivery of optimally dosed RPT.

"Flexible Bayesian approaches to causal inference with multilevel survival data and multiple treatments Project Summary Combining comparative effectiveness research (CER) and dissemination and implementation research is playing an increased role in public health and health care service by allowing practitioners to make informed decisions about treatments and improving adoption of evidence-based practices. In circumstances where CER questions do not lend themselves to direct experimentation or in implementation trials where incomplete adoption of in- tervention occurs, causal inference tools for “ﬁeld data” are recommended for evaluating treatment effects. The increased complexities in large national electronic health databases pose challenges for statistical analyses and demand approaches beyond conventional causal inference techniques, which have traditionally focused on bi- nary treatment. Given the wealth of information captured in large-scale data, it is rare that treatment regimens are deﬁned in terms of two treatments only. The data are typically pooled from treating facilities across the nation with considerable variability in the institutional effect. Although it has been established that popular tools for bi- nary treatment are inappropriate for the multiple treatment setting, and that ignoring the multilevel data structure can bias the estimate of the treatment effect, few alternative methods have been proposed to deal with both complications simultaneously. The ﬁrst aim of our proposed project is to develop a novel and ﬂexible Bayesian approach to estimating the causal effects of multiple treatments on survival with clustered data. We then fully investigate the operating characteristics of our proposed method in a variety of simulated scenarios and contrast it with approaches often used in practice. For causal estimates to be unbiased, researchers commonly make the assumption of no unmeasured confounding (UMC). Though highly recommended with binary treatment, there is no known implementation or framework for sensitivity analysis with multiple treatments and multilevel survival data. The second aim of our project is to develop and apply a ﬂexible and interpretable Bayesian approach to assessing the sensitivity of causal estimates to possible departures from the assumption of no UMC, at both cluster- and individual-level. This approach is capable of gauging the amount of unobserved confounding needed to change the direction of the observed treatment effects Our project will apply the developed methods in the ﬁrst two aims to a large representative high-risk localized prostate cancer population, drawn from the National Cancer Data Base, to evaluate the average causal effects of three popular treatment options on survival and evaluate how unmeasured confounding might alter causal conclusions. We also will estimate treatment heterogeneity and identify distinct subgroups of patients for which a treatment is effective or harmful. Our methods will establish the effectiveness component and lay the groundwork for building the cost-effectiveness models, and provide evidence for further investigations of variations in intervention implementation and modiﬁcations in recommendations for treatments leading to different patient outcomes. To facilitate the dissemination of our work, we will share the underlying statistical code via an R package. Project Narrative As public health comparisons often involve more than two treatments on patients from multiple care centers, comparative effectiveness research and implementation research call for advanced causal inference techniques allowing for the estimation of multiple treatment effects while respecting the multilevel data structure. We de- velop a new approach to simultaneously contrast the effectiveness of multiple treatments on clustered survival outcomes, propose and apply a new framework for testing the assumptions behind these estimates, and propose a strategy for estimating treatment effect heterogeneity and identifying distinct subgroups of patients for which a treatment is harmful or effective. Our work will provide practitioners clarity with respect to estimating causes and effects from complicated health care databases in which the comparative assessment of multiple treatment options from multilevel survival data is challenging but imperative.",Flexible Bayesian approaches to causal inference with multilevel survival data and multiple treatments,10056850,R21CA245855,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Androgens', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Brachytherapy', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Code', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Event', 'Evidence based practice', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Public Health', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer epidemiology', 'comparative', 'complex data ', 'cost effectiveness', 'data structure', 'data tools', 'deprivation', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'effective therapy', 'epidemiology study', 'flexibility', 'health care service', 'high risk', 'implementation research', 'implementation trial', 'improved', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient subsets', 'regression trees', 'simulation', 'structured data', 'survival outcome', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment choice', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2020,459480,0.04908203490462741
"Refining and Validating Borderline Personality Disorder Phenotypes Through Factor Mixture Modeling The proposed research seeks to clarify the symptomatic heterogeneity of borderline personality disorder (BPD) by examining BPD phenotypes through advanced latent variable modeling. A second, innovative aim is to validate these findings through intensive longitudinal assessment in daily life. BPD is associated with high rates of emergency room visits and costly healthcare service utilization, affecting 10-20% of psychiatric outpatients and 20-40% of psychiatric inpatients. BPD also contributes to impaired social and occupational functioning and significant suicide risk, with 1 in 10 individuals with BPD completing suicide. Recent research has aimed to enhance treatment effectiveness for BPD by identifying prototypical patterns of symptom manifestation that may suggest ideographic treatment targets. However, no research has simultaneously included: a) a sufficiently large patient sample; b) ecologically sound validation of results; and c) use of appropriate statistical techniques. The proposed project builds on this research through two aims. Aim 1: Utilize a model comparison approach to identify BPD phenotypes in a large psychiatric outpatient sample assessed via semi-structured diagnostic interviews (Study 1). Aim 2: Validate the results of Study 1 by applying phenotype classification algorithms produced in Study 1 to a smaller sample of patients who have completed 21 days of momentary surveys on symptoms and clinical outcomes (Study 2). To address Aim 1, factor mixture modeling (FMM)—a novel, flexible, and integrative latent variable modeling approach—will be compared to standard factor analysis and latent class analysis in order to evaluate the dimensional and categorical structure of BPD. We expect a single-factor, multi-class FMM will best explain heterogeneity in BPD, over and above other sources of heterogeneity (e.g., gender, comorbidity). To address Aim 2, we will use a prototype-matching approach to algorithmically assign patients in the validation sample to phenotypes identified in Aim 1 and determine their predictive validity in terms of daily clinical outcomes. Results of this project will provide empirically grounded personalized prediction tools for BPD intervention and treatment development, in line with the NIMH’s goal of “developing, testing, and refining tools and methodologies… for personalized risk and trajectory prediction and intervention.” This fellowship will allow the applicant to receive tailored consultation from experts in methodology, data analysis, and BPD theory and assessment, as well as advanced statistical training and grantsmanship courses and workshops. This training will be enhanced by the resource-rich environment and explicit support of student research and funding provided by the Pennsylvania State University, as well as the support of Dr. Kenneth Levy and his lab. This promising young researcher will gain training in computational modeling, proficiency in working with “big data,” increased understanding of conceptual and nosological models of BPD, and further skills in disseminating research findings through publication and presentation, as vital steps towards an independent research career in translational clinical science. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to elucidate the underlying psychopathology of borderline personality disorder (BPD), a prevalent, costly, and deadly psychiatric condition, through the identification of ecologically valid phenotypes of the disorder.

"Predicting Urinary Continence Status with Sacral Neuromodulation and Botulinum Toxin Treatments PROJECT SUMMARY Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) include urinary urgency, incontinence, and nocturia, afflict roughly 50% of the adult population, and have substantial, wide-ranging impact. Many gaps remain in our understanding of these symptoms, leading to inadequate treatment. Urgency urinary incontinence, one form of LUTS, was the focus of two recent multi-site clinical trials (Anticholinergic vs. Botox Comparison Study or ABC and Refractory Overactive Bladder: Sacral NEuromodulation vs. BoTulinum Toxin Assessment or ROSETTA). These trials compared the efficacy of urgency urinary incontinence therapies, 100 Units (U) Onabotulinum Toxin A (Botox) versus an anticholinergic medication (ABC) and 200U Botox versus sacral neuromodulation (SNM)(ROSETTA). These studies compared whether on average 100U Botox was superior to a standard anticholinergic regimen (ABC) and whether 200U Botox was superior to SNM (ROSETTA). The objective of this K01 proposal is to use the same clinical trial data to create predictive models that accurately estimate the likelihood that a patient will respond to Botox and SNM treatments, as well as the likelihood of developing urinary retention or urinary tract infections (risks associated with Botox treatment). In addition to medical histories and questionnaires some of the predictive models will incorporate diagnostic measurements, both standard and novel, from tests of bladder function (urodynamics). This approach will allow for the formal assessment of the utility of urodynamics in guiding treatment decisions, something that is currently debated in the field. This project will result in innovative models which can be used to: 1) predict whether a patient will respond to Botox and SNM treatments and the likelihood of adverse events (Botox only); 2) determine the utility of urodynamics data in predicting patient response to treatment and 3) identify patients that are resistant to treatment, so as to guide future research. These models will offer a patient specific, data-driven approach to treatment that will greatly benefit patient care and help reduce costs to the health care system. This project will also provide training in predictive modeling and clinical benign urology under the guidance of an experienced mentoring team. The candidate’s long-term objective is to lead a strong independent research program to design new therapies for patients with (LUTS) informed by both animal and human studies, and to match patients with suitable therapies based on individual patient characteristics (personalized medicine). PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will result in predictive models that clinicians can use to help guide patients when selecting third line therapies for urgency incontinence; providing patients with tailored estimates of how likely it is that they will respond successfully to sacral neuromodulation or intradetrusor Onabotulinum Toxin A. These models will make use of individual characteristics (i.e. personalized medicine), rather than using the current practice, a one-size-fits-all approach, for guiding treatment selection. By improving the match between therapies and patients, it is expected that these models will ultimately improve the quality of treatment that patients receive as well as reduce healthcare costs.",Predicting Urinary Continence Status with Sacral Neuromodulation and Botulinum Toxin Treatments,9977422,K01DK121866,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Aftercare', 'Animals', 'Anti-Cholinergics', 'Benign', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Control', 'Botox', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Catheters', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical History', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nocturia', 'Overactive Bladder', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Questionnaires', 'Refractory', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Residual volume', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Human Experimentation', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urge Incontinence', 'Urinary Incontinence', 'Urinary Retention', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urodynamics', 'Urology', 'Woman', 'alpha Toxin', 'base', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'expectation', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'lower urinary tract symptoms', 'mathematical model', 'micturition urgency', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'trial comparing']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,22825,0.039155998494384656
"Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold-standard method of evaluating cancer treatment, which has immense health and economic burdens worldwide. However, practical considerations that allow an RCT to be conducted typically require a relatively small sample size and restricted eligibility criteria such that the study has inadequate power to generalize treatment effects to elderly patients or other under-represented patient pop- ulations. On the other hand, massive real-world data (RWD) are increasingly captured by population-based databases and registries, such as Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), SEER-Medicare, and National Cancer Database (NCDB), that have much broader demographic and clinical diversity compared to RCT cohorts. Treatment evaluation using causal inference methods and RWD that were not collected purely for re- search purposes is now frequently performed but fraught with limitations such as confounding due to lack of randomization. In fact, the agreement between RCT and RWD ﬁndings is often low in the analysis of matched RCT and RWD studies with the same treatment comparisons. Although several national organizations and reg- ulatory agencies have advocated using RWD to complement RCTs, methods that integrate these two potentially complementary data sources and achieve better treatment evaluation over the use of a single data source alone have yet to be developed.  This proposal is motivated by the PIs' collaborative work to study the safety and efﬁcacy of treatment strategies for elderly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal cancer patients by integrating data from multiple sources: RCTs from NCI cooperative groups and the real-world databases (e.g. SEER, SEER-Medicare, and NCDB). The objective of this project is to develop new statistical methods for integrative analyses of RCTs and RWD that can improve the generalizability and increase estimation efﬁciency of RCT ﬁndings to more diverse ""real-world"" patients as well as under-studied populations while avoiding confounding bias inherent in RWD. In Aim 1, we develop methods for statistical analysis of RCT data to compare chemoradiotherapy patterns for the real-world and elderly NSCLC patients by leveraging the baseline covariates of comparable patients from SEER, for whom the temporal information of chemotherapy and radiation and the outcome are both missing. Aims 2 and 3 focus on the settings when both RCT and RWD provide comparable covariates, treatment, and outcome information. In Aim 2, we develop improved analysis of RCT data to evaluate trimodality therapy versus surgery alone for the real-world and elderly esophageal cancer patients by exploiting the large sample size and predictive power offered by the NCDB/SEER-Medicare. In Aim 3, we develop new efﬁcient and data-adaptive methods to estimate individualized treatment effects of adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation, possibly modiﬁed by age and tumor size, for stage IB resected NSCLC patients by integrating RCT and NCDB data. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is closely in line with the 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, which placed additional focus on the use of big real-world data to support decision making and precision medicine. The availability of multiple data sources, namely randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and real-world databases, presents unique and novel opportunities for medical research, because the knowledge that can be acquired from integrative analyses would not be possible from any single-source analysis alone. Our effort is important to bridge RCTs and vast real-world databases and registries arising from clinical practices in order to better understand how treatment works for the real-world and under-studied patient populations outside relatively narrow RCT eligibility criteria and provide accurate and reliable evidence for patient-centered care.",Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data,9947226,R01AG066883,"['Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Medical Research', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'SEER Program', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Target Populations', 'Therapy trial', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical trial analysis', 'cohort', 'disease registry', 'health economics', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'safety study', 'study population', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R01,2020,409049,0.015124744775798412
"Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program “Optimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasis”constitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC “Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis” will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities OVERVIEW NARRATIVE Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment.

"A Big Data Approach to BCR ABL Leukemias BCR-ABL1 positive leukemias account for a substantial portion of adult leukemia. Tyrosine kinase  inhibitors (TKIs) have dramatically changed survival outlook. However, current protocols recommend  patients receive TKI chemotherapy agents indefinitely, causing long-term toxicity and substantive  quality of life deficits, leading to decreased TKI compliance. Moreover, >50% of patients who stop  TKIs ultimately relapse and are not as responsive to post-relapse treatment; additionally, mutation  resistance is becoming an increasing issue with TKIs as patients live longer. It is hypothesized  patient heterogeneity within BCR-ABL1 leukemias are a major driving factor on outcome and strongly  influences optimal TKI selection and cessation. However, small cohort size and disease rarity has  impacted large, pragmatic clinical trials, necessitating a big data approach. The overall goal is  to quilt together individual studies to produce a comprehensive view of BCR-ABL1 leukemias that  includes epidemiology, etiology, assessment, and therapy, as well their inter-relationships. With  a comprehensive view, personalized, predictive medicine becomes possible. This project utilizes  literature mining and “big data” techniques to analyze four major categories: epidemiology (who  gets BCR-ABL1 leukemias, how response correlates to patient characteristics, etc.); etiology (what  factors trigger mutation, mechanisms to improve TKI specificity, preclinical model metrics,  prognostic indicators of recurrence/relapse, etc.); assessment (identifying new  diagnostic/prognostic metrics, improving polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols, objective  staging criteria); and treatment (aggregate effect sizes among different therapies, short and  long-term side effect profiles, TKI selection protocols, adjunctive and combination therapies,  criteria for TKI cessation, etc.). The specific aims of the project include: 1) prototype a data  path and construct infrastructure for BCR-ABL1 data curation from literature and/or clinical  sources; 2) construct literature ontological field map to quantify topic depth, aggregate data, and  identify relationships within and between categories; 3) perform exploratory analysis to assess  aggregate statistical power and prototype predictive models for TKI optimization. In summary, the  present project delivers a 21st century, big data approach for BCR-ABL1 leukemia to optimize  clinical management and expedite basic preclinical research. This project is highly relevant to public health as it enables a comprehensive view of BCR ABL  positive leukemia(s) that can optimize clinical management and expedite preclinical research.",A Big Data Approach to BCR ABL Leukemias,9869875,R21CA232249,"['ABL1 gene', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Animal Model', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Study', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Modeling', 'Dimensions', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Oncogenes', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sample Size', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor', 'Universities', 'Wheelchairs', 'adult leukemia', 'base', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'compliance behavior', 'data curation', 'data mining', 'database schema', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'drug intolerance', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'leukemia', 'lexical', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'personalized predictions', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'rare cancer', 'relational database', 'resistance mutation', 'response', 'side effect', 'text searching', 'treatment duration']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2020,190454,0.02085381009260645
"Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy Title: Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy ABSTRACT Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, multifactorial, autoimmune disorder that affects ~1% of the worldwide population (~2 million adults in the US alone). It is characterized by chronic synovitis that, when left untreated, can result in irreversible joint destruction and deformity, leading to increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. The last three decades have witnessed impressive advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic outcomes. In fact, the use of methotrexate first, and the subsequent incorporation of anti-TNF (TNFi) and other “biologics” have led to substantial improvements in RA clinical outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for millions of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Despite this progress, however, a significant question still remains unanswered: why do over 50% of RA patients with moderate to severe arthritis fail to respond appropriately to these agents? Pharmacomicrobiomics – an emerging field of study that investigates the effect of variations within the human gut microbiome on drugs – promises to overcome these barriers and facilitate precision medicine approaches in autoimmune disease.  Methotrexate (MTX), a dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase inhibitor, remains the anchor drug for the treatment of RA and is used widely throughout the world. While quite effective, oral MTX achieves significant results in less than 50% of patients and remission in only a quarter of them. It is well established that the inter-individual bioavailability of MTX is extremely variable, ranging from 10 to 80%. The reasons for this are presumably multifactorial. However, the intestinal microbiome and its enzymatic machinery are likely to play a significant role, based on our Preliminary Results and given that animals treated with antibiotics or kept under germ-free conditions show significant differences in MTX metabolism relative to control animals.  Our multidisciplinary team composed of rheumatologists, bioinformaticians, pharmacologists and microbiome researchers will address our overarching goal to study: a) if baseline intestinal microbiome, its genes, and associated metabolites can be used to predict the immunomodulatory responses to MTX in treatment-naïve, new-onset RA (NORA) patients; and b) if the gut microbiomes of MTX non-responders can be manipulated to modulate MTX metabolism and bioavailability. We believe that the results of our highly translational, innovative studies will directly influence therapeutic approaches for the treatment of RA and offer a more personalized approach in which the clinical efficacy response would be predicted early (and potentially improved by microbiome-targeted adjuvant therapies) in any given patient about to initiate MTX, limiting or preventing disease progression and ultimately avoiding wasteful health expenditures (estimated as ~$50,000/year/patient in direct costs). Importantly, we anticipate that our studies will establish generalizable approaches in rheumatology and autoimmunity that could be more broadly applied to the study and clinical maximization of other similar small molecules (e.g., JAK inhibitors) or even biologic agents (e.g., anti-TNF mAbs). NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread musculoskeletal inflammation affecting 1% of the world’s population (including ~2 million adults in the US alone). While the use of methotrexate (MTX) has significantly improved the lives of many people with RA, over 50% of patients do not respond adequately to this drug. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide key insights into the effects of the gut bacteria on MTX and the implications for prediction of clinical response, ultimately identifying patients that are either likely to improve even before this treatment is prescribed, or those that would benefit from microbiome-targeted interventions to improve MTX absorption and efficacy.",Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy,9989043,R01AR074500,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitor', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Engraftment', 'Excess Mortality', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Role', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synovitis', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'arthritis therapy', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'chronic autoimmune disease', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'drug disposition', 'drug metabolism', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'germ free condition', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'joint destruction', 'joint injury', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome components', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'polyglutamates', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'rRNA Genes', 'recruit', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'rheumatologist', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'therapy outcome']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,677759,0.006481841588663211
