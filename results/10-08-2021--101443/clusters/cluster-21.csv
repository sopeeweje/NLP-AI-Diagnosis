"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Project Summary The growing importance of artificial intelligence (AI) is visible by the growth in companies and increasing deals over the past year between pharma and smaller companies using machine learning to assist in drug discovery. The continuing steady growth of structure-activity data for diverse targets, diseases and molecular properties poses a considerable challenge as they are generally not readily accessible for machine learning: content resides in a mixture of public databases (with differing levels of curation), disparate files within research groups, non- curated literature publications. In Phase I, Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. developed a prototype of Assay Central software and used this with a wide variety of structure activity data from sources both public and private, formatted and unformatted, for enabling neglected, rare or common disease targets. Public data was mixed with collaborator/customer-contributed data, using original software and applied chemistry judgment of an expert team. In Phase I we created error checking and correction software. We also built and validated Bayesian models with the datasets that were collected and cleaned. And, in addition, we developed new data visualization tools. The software environment that we created readily enables the user to compile structure-activity data for building computational models and can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators as needed. This software can in turn be used for scoring new molecules and visualizing the multiple outputs in various formats. We have enabled ~14 collaborative projects which have shared models on specific targets such as PyrG for Tuberculosis (identifying a lead compound), HIV reverse transcriptase, whole cell screening for Leishmaniasis as well as P450 and nuclear receptor models (e.g. estrogen receptor) relevant to toxicology. We have utilized Assay Central in our ongoing internal projects working on Ebola, HIV and tuberculosis small molecule drug discovery. In Phase II, we propose the following aims that will enable us to develop Assay Central into a production tool for enabling drug discovery collaborations which we will continue to focus on. In Phase 1 we performed a preliminary analysis of different machine learning algorithms with select drug discovery datasets. In Phase II we will now perform a thorough evaluation and selection of additional machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors as well as assessment of combination of algorithms (e.g. Bayesian and Deep Learning). We will implement disease/target definitions for machine learning models to facilitate drug discovery. We will enable molecule selection and automated design and optimization. The utility of having such a tool as Assay Central readily available will empower scientists to leverage public, private or a combination of data to help with their drug discovery tasks. Developing this software suite of computational models with public data will enable us to identify foundations, academics and potential collaborators that generate preliminary data to test models. These efforts will dramatically increase the number of projects we can work on, create new IP, and generate employment using machine learning focused on drug discovery in the area of rare and neglected diseases, in particular. Assay Central benefits include 1. Ease of deployment and use with a Java file executed by users without the need for IT support; 2. Built on industry standard technologies; 3. Graphical display of models provides instant feedback; 4 Model applicability with multiple methods to assess scores and graphics. Project Narrative In Phase I Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. have developed a prototype of ‘Assay Central’ software and used this with a wide variety of structure activity data from sources both public and private, formatted and unformatted, for enabling neglected, rare or common disease targets. The software environment that we created readily enables us to compile structure-activity data for building computational models, can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators and has been used successfully to find promising lead compounds for many collaborators. We now propose in Phase II to optimize the underlying machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors (e.g. combining Bayesian and Deep Learning), linking potentially thousands of rare and neglected diseases to the machine learning models, and automating molecule selection and new molecule design to enable further high value drug discovery collaborations with Assay Central.",Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations,9751326,R44GM122196,"['Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Client', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ebola virus', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Fees', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'HIV/TB', 'Industry Standard', 'Intelligence', 'Intention', 'Java', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leishmaniasis', 'Licensing', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training Support', 'Triage', 'Tuberculosis', 'Update', 'Vendor', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'computational suite', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data submission', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'exhaustion', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neglect', 'novel therapeutics', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'scale up', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trend']",NIGMS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R44,2019,692845,0.030698928986487222
"MegaTox for analyzing and visualizing data across different screening systems Project Summary Computational toxicology aims to use rules, models and algorithms based on prior data for specific endpoints, to enable the prediction of whether a new molecule will possess similar liabilities or not. In some cases, the computational models are derived from discrete molecular endpoints while in others they are quite broad in scope. Considerable progress has been made in computational toxicology in a decade both in model development and availability such that the next generation of larger scale models will promote it to the next level and further focus in vitro and in vivo testing on verification of select predictions. Pharmaceutical, consumer products and other chemistry focused companies possess structure-activity data generated over many decades of screening that is not in the public domain, and this data is primarily only accessible to the cheminformatics experts in each company. Outside of these companies small biotechs and academics must rely on data from public databases, commercial databases and their own data. Integrating such data and processing it to build algorithms that can help with predictive models is a vast undertaking. Our recent efforts have used sources like PubChem and ChEMBL to build predictive models for different toxicity related and drug discovery endpoints. Drug companies tend to focus on target related information whereas there might be an opportunity to understand toxicity also. Our work with a consumer product company indicated the need for accessing machine learning models based on the growing public datasets could be a commercially viable product. Without massive legacy internal data many of small drug discovery and consumer product companies will have to make do with data accessible in PubChem, ChEMBL or other public databases (ToxCast, Tox21 etc) only. In this proposal we will provide toxicity machine learning models developed with different algorithms (Bayesian, Support vector machines, random forest and Deep Neural Networks as just some examples) for 40-50 in vitro and in vivo datasets. We are not aware of any other company pursuing such an approach to create as wide an array of toxicity models. We are also not aware of other software companies in the toxicity model space generating their own experimental data to test the models. Such a technology could have very broad utility for other pharmaceutical companies, biotechs, consumer product companies, regulatory groups and academic research groups. As we have been working for several years to build up technologies and experience in cheminformatics and software development it would be relatively straightforward for us to build the core foundations of MegaTox and deliver them to potential customers. This technology will also be used in our consulting projects with pharmaceutical and consumer product companies. Project Narrative The objective of ‘MegaTox’ is to develop a new computational system and tools for integrating toxicity data, and machine learning models. This will enable the prediction of various toxicity endpoints relevant to pharmaceutical and consumer product companies. We will use the latest machine learning algorithms, access the latest curated public datasets and develop a user intuitive interface and visualization system. We will use MegaTox internally for our own drug discovery projects as well as leverage it for consulting for clients so we can combine public and private datasets and increase the coverage of chemical property space. We will perform generate toxicity data in house and with collaborators to test our models.",MegaTox for analyzing and visualizing data across different screening systems,9846503,R43ES031038,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biotechnology', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Client', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Drug Interactions', 'Ensure', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'FDA approved', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Public Domains', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Solubility', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aqueous', 'base', 'chemical property', 'cheminformatics', 'computational toxicology', 'computerized data processing', 'consumer product', 'cytotoxicity', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'environmental chemical', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'in vivo evaluation', 'learning strategy', 'liver injury', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'molecular array', 'multitask', 'next generation', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnane X receptor', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'screening', 'software development', 'tool']",NIEHS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2019,224548,0.023056863898781515
"An Integrative Approach to Drug Repositioning Using Decision Tree Based Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite recent advances in life sciences and technology, the amount of money spent developing a single drug has stayed drastically expensive. Overall efficiencies have caused drug development to stay the same, with an average cost of $2.6 billion and 15 years to develop a single drug. Considering these challenges, there is an increased need for drug repositioning, in which new indications are found for existing or unapproved drugs. Here we introduce an approach that integrates only drug similarity metrics, such as side effect, structure, and target similarities, to identify novel indications for drugs. By focusing on drug similarity metrics, our proposed method allows for applications towards orphan molecules that presently have no primary indication. To improve upon the current methods of drug repurposing, we propose the developing of a computational approach that utilizes multiple data types within a machine-learning framework in order to predict indications a drug may treat. Based on the observations that similar drugs are used for similar indications, this method utilizes publicly available databases to identify associations between drugs, and integrates drug similarity data, as well as drug-target specific information, into a machine-learning framework in order to accurately predict indications for these drugs. Altogether, our method provides a novel, broadly applicable strategy that can identify novel indications, allowing for an accelerated and more efficient method for future drug development and repositioning efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Bringing a drug to market requires an enormous amount of time and money, so our proposed research is designed to address this unmet need to streamline the drug discovery process. Using big data analysis, we are developing a computational method to utilize drug similarity information to predict novel diseases that drugs can treat.",An Integrative Approach to Drug Repositioning Using Decision Tree Based Machine Learning,9682615,F31LM013058,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Biological Sciences', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug Utilization', 'Drug usage', 'Encyclopedias', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Orphan', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'Viagra', 'Voting', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'side effect']",NLM,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,F31,2019,45016,0.15407710504453392
"MegaTrans – human transporter machine learning models Summary Being able to predict interactions with important human transporters would be of value to new drug design to avoid compounds that interact with them and cause undesirable side effects. OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1) and OATP1B3 (SLCO1B3) are `uptake' transporters largely restricted to the sinusoidal aspect of hepatocytes. They both transport a wide variety of structurally-unrelated compounds, including members of several clinically im- portant drug families such as statins, sartans and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. We now propose to test over 1000 drugs against 2 substrates for each transporter in vitro. We will then use these data to curate and validate machine learning models. We will also use an array of machine learning methods as well as multiple model evaluation metrics. This will enable us to develop a web-based software tool called MegaTrans that will encourage the user to input their own compound structures and generate predictions for interactions with transporter/s of interest and then visualize the similarity to the training set of each model using several different visualization methods. The return on investment of such a tool would be that it could assist in the design and selection of more favorable compounds that avoid transporters of interest while also saving time and money. It could also identify compounds that are already approved that might present a drug interaction risk. Predicting such behavior seen in vivo is ideal and will lead to the prioritization of compounds to test in vitro for potential drug-drug interactions. In Phase II we would greatly expand the number of transporters which we would generate data on and build models such that we could address all the major transporters of interest to drug discovery. Narrative The objective of “MegaTrans” is to develop a new computational system and tools for integrating human trans- porter data into drug discovery pipelines, as well as enabling its analysis and visualization. This will then enable improved computational tool development for in vitro to in vivo extrapolation of xenobiotic exposures across a range of assay types. It will also assist with developing computational tools for quantitatively modeling drug-drug interactions of xenobiotics. Across Phase I and Phase II we will generate data for transporters which currently have a paucity of data in the public domain, use validated machine learning algorithms, access the latest curated datasets and develop a user intuitive interface and visualization system to enable predictions.",MegaTrans – human transporter machine learning models,9768844,R41GM131433,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Compounding', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Modelings', 'Ensure', 'Estradiol', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescein', 'Glucuronides', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Kinetics', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Products', 'Online Systems', 'Organic Cation Transporter', 'Output', 'POU2F2 gene', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'PubChem', 'Public Domains', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Work', 'Xenobiotics', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput screening', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'model building', 'novel therapeutics', 'prospective', 'side effect', 'software development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'uptake']",NIGMS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R41,2019,210712,0.04854260797622568
"Machine Learning for Drug Response Prediction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Finding new drugs in the seas of small molecules is a difficult task if no prior information is available. Our broad research goal is to develop innovative and accurate machine learning algorithms to predict the drug responses related to complex human diseases. Specifically, we pursue questions of how a cell line responds to a single drug and combinatorial therapies, from the perspective of biological networks and small-molecule chemoinformatics. One research goal is to understand and predict the cell line-specific responses through integrating a wide range of methods, including the propagation of drug effects via biological networks, matrix factorization of molecular profiles and chemoinformatic analysis of small molecules. We will deploy our algorithms to softwares and web servers, which will inform the downstream experimental design to identify the single and combinatorial drug candidates against human diseases. Our research program will contribute to accelerate the drug discovery process by in silico screening through large amount of potent chemicals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Molecular targeted therapy is one of the most successful weapons against many complex human diseases. However, identifying effective small-molecule drugs is like looking for a needle in a haystack.

"Meta-Analysis and Machine Learning: Towards Neuromarkers of Craving and Relapse Abstract The experience of drug craving is known to increase drug use1-6 and relapse after treatment7-16. Specifically, drug-related stimuli are known to elicit cue-induced craving, as well as physiological and neural responses, called cue reactivity, which have all been directly linked to drug use and relapse across addictions17-35, including gambling36-39. To date, hundreds of studies investigated neural cue-reactivity; however, there is little consensus in findings, due to significant variation in methods, drug types, cue types, and analysis procedures. Further, prior meta-analyses used suboptimal methods and inclusion criteria, and were underpowered40-44. In Aim 1, we propose to use state-of-the-art meta-analytic methods45-47 to summarize findings from ~120 published imaging studies, representing >3000 participants during neural cue reactivity/cue- induced craving (and 3x larger than any prior meta-analysis). Following our prior meta-analytic work in other domains48-61, we will use optimized inclusion criteria and correction methods, and account for multiple methodological differences in studies across substances (e.g., cigarettes, alcohol, cocaine, cannabis) and gambling, a behavioral addiction. Further, we will test for differences across drug types (e.g., cigarettes vs. alcohol) and different cue-types (e.g., pictures vs. video) to resolve several open questions in the field (e.g., role of insula in cigarette craving vs. drug craving in general62, 63; pre-scan abstinence64, 65). In Aim 2, we will go beyond meta-analysis to address an urgent need in addiction research66: development of predictive biomarkers67-69, which are stable indicators of biological processes. Biomarkers have been developed in other areas of medicine70, and we have recently done this in pain71, negative emotion72-74, and empathy74. To do this, we will combine the meta-analytic results obtained in Aim 1 with person-level fMRI data from our lab (of cue-induced craving75-79) using machine learning models, to establish a multivariate pattern of neural activity that can predict craving self-report from neural activity – a predictive neuromarker for craving. Given the associations between neural cue reactivity, craving, and drug use outcome, a multivariate neuromarker could provide a powerful neural predictor of outcomes66, 67. Thus, in Aim 3, we will validate this neuromarker on data from two ongoing clinical trials of N=128 cigarette smokers and N=150 cocaine users collected at Yale's Psychotherapy Development Center (P50 DA09241; Center PI: Carroll; Project PI: Kober). Here, the neuromarker will be used on pre-treatment fMRI cue-reactivity data to predict both self-reported craving and long-term clinical outcomes (e.g., cocaine abstinence). The validated neuromarker will provide well-defined brain targets that can then be used to test the efficacy of interventions to reduce craving and drug use, such as pharmacotherapies, brain stimulation, or cognitive training, and to monitor patient progress in both research and clinical settings. ! Project Narrative Among substance users, exposure to drug cues is associated with neural cue reactivity and cue-induced craving, both of which are directly linked to addiction severity and relapse after treatment. We will employ state-of-the-art statistical and computational methods to establish a consistent neural pattern associated with cue reactivity and cue-induced craving. Then we will validate it using recently-collected imaging data – moving towards a predictive biomarker of drug craving, which can be used to investigate brain processes related to treatment efficacy and drug use outcomes in research as well as clinical settings.",Meta-Analysis and Machine Learning: Towards Neuromarkers of Craving and Relapse,9688971,R01DA043690,"['Abstinence', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cannabis', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Users', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Cues', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug usage', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gambling', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychotherapy', 'Publishing', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'cognitive training', 'craving', 'cue reactivity', 'density', 'design', 'drug craving', 'drug relapse', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'movie', 'neural correlate', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'smoking cue', 'success']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,446497,0.047574872683283
"Commercialization of a Software Platform to Increase the Efficiency of Human Clinical Trials using Patient-Level Machine Learning Models ABSTRACT Neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are characterized by heterogeneous disease progression. As a group, these complex diseases are influenced by an interplay between several genetic and environmental factors. Drug development for these diseases could benefit from a framework that selects more homogeneous participants for inclusion in clinical trials, but current methods have largely failed in this regard. In ALS, both slowly and rapidly progressing patients have been identified as confounding statistical analyses of clinical trials. Statistically speaking, heterogeneous disease progression rates in ALS clinical trials contribute to both trial arm misbalances and high variances of study populations. These issues increase the size, duration and cost of clinical trials in neurological diseases and contribute to high failure rates. In our successful phase 1 SBIR grant, we used ALS as a model disease to develop our neurological disease product prototype based on machine learning disease progression models that improves trial arm randomization and stratifies participants according to disease progression. We worked with a clinical trialist to develop a user interface capable of returning a randomization group assignment in real-time. Our ForecastOne® Trials prototype product has passed IRB review and will be used in a 12-site clinical trial starting in fall, 2017. The objectives of this phase 2 SBIR are to convert the ALS neurological product prototype into a commercializable, robust, scalable, market-ready product with a versatile API and to develop a pipeline of models and applications that will expand our product offerings of drug development and clinical trial optimization tools for additional neurodegenerative indications. Aim 1: Construct a robust, scalable platform infrastructure for the neurological product based on a central  Application Programming Interface (API) that receives user input and returns actionable information in real-time.  The prototype ForecastOne® Trials tool will be developed into a robust, scalable 21 CFR part 11 compliant product  using ALS as a first indication that allows the rapid deployment of additional applications and disease indications. Aim 2: Develop a pipeline of neurodegenerative models and applications to populate the neurological product. We  will add additional disease indications to the product created in Aim 1, including AD, PD and HD. The suite of marketable products that we create following this phase 2 grant will answer drug development needs of a full portfolio of neurodegenerative diseases. Ultimately, we see a series of machine learning models and applications aimed at solving drug development issues for multiple disease areas, including oncology, cardiology, infectious diseases, metabolic disorders, autoimmune diseases and respiratory diseases, etc. These models and applications will vastly increase the speed and efficiency of drug development, resulting in faster, cheaper, more efficient drug trials that yield numerous new medications to ease human pain and suffering.

"A Knowledge Map to Find Alzheimer's Disease Drugs To stem the rising incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in our aging population, new methods to repurpose and combine drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) are acutely required. This is a challenge, however, because the complex polygenic basis of AD remains opaque, and rational methods to repurpose drugs are in early years, even for well-defined gene targets. To address these problems, we propose new algorithms to integrate data on a very large scale so as to combine evolutionary information and high-throughput experimental observations with the knowledge conveyed by text in the literature. First, to detect disease-relevant genome variations in AD patients, Aim 1 will combine a novel mathematical calculus of mutational landscapes with machine learning, in so doing suggesting primary candidate genes for drug targeting based on signs of mutational selection in cases or controls. Next, to repurpose and combine drugs targeting these genes, Aim 2 will map a large fraction of all that is known about genes, phenotypes, and drugs into a single high-dimensional network that represents their interactions as described in various databases (structured data) and in the literature (unstructured data). The topology of this network will determine the optimal choice of single drug or combination therapy in an approach that can be personalized. Finally, to validate efficacy experimentally, Aim 3 will test both our candidate genes and drugs with state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo screens. Feasibility rests with prior studies on evolution, networks, systems, and text-mining that demonstrate accurate predictions of deleterious mutations and their clinical sequelae and the discovery of drivers of diseases. Broadly, this work will yield proof of principle for a novel quantitative model that integrates fundamental concepts from mathematics and molecular evolution, and for a low resolution but large-scale map of biomedical knowledge in which network notions of distance computed by machine learning identify relevant functional hypothesis that would otherwise be easily overlooked. The result will be a new experimental ability to unravel the genotype-phenotype relationship in Alzheimer's Disease so as to guide drug therapy. Alzheimer's is a devastating disease projected to rise dramatically in our aging population. To develop drugs against it, we propose to train machine learning on the DNA of patients with Alzheimer's to detect genes with abnormal mathematical features in their mutations. We will place these genes in a “map”, which represents a large fraction of biomedical knowledge in a high-dimensional network, the drugs that fall near our genes of interest in this map are our candidates, and experiments will test in cell and mouse models whether they affect the hallmark signs of Alzheimer's.",A Knowledge Map to Find Alzheimer's Disease Drugs,9928609,R01AG061105,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Calculi', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Evolution', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'database structure', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'stem', 'text searching']",NIA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,228000,-0.023424273327951366
"Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The high rate of failure in CNS drug discovery, in particular of the first-in-class therapeutics with new modes of action, highlights a clear unmet need to improve the success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders. One well-known issue is the poor ability of current bioassays and animal models to predict the efficacy and side-effects of compounds. In response, there is a steady growth in the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) in clinical trials in recent years. Pharmaceutical companies are incorporating EEG more often in their preclinical drug discovery efforts because the high degree of translatability of EEG from rodents to humans makes it ideal to use in de-risking programs in drug discovery. Moreover, quantitative EEG (qEEG) is an objective measurement of brain activity with a high test-retest reliability and considerable predictive, face, and construct validity. Additionally, well-documented literature shows that certain classes of drugs elicit different EEG fingerprints, suggesting that EEG yields pharmaco-dynamic signatures specific to pharmacological action and can be used to enable classification of drugs based on the effects of the EEG. Further, EEG can be used to rapidly screen compounds for potential activity at specific pharmacological targets and provide valuable information for guiding the early stages of drug development. However, to date, no EEG-based tool is broadly available to be used to predict the therapeutic utility of unknown compounds for drug discovery in psychiatric disorders. In order to develop such a tool, PsychoGenics, Inc., is leveraging our existing expertise in performing high-throughput pharmaco-sleep-EEG studies and our established proprietary machine learning approach to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications or underlying mechanism of action (MOA; i.e. the neurotransmitter system/receptor targets) of unknown compounds for psychiatric disorders. Our aims are 1) to generate a quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) database of compounds with a known mechanism and therapeutic value in mice, and 2) to develop a classifier using supervised machine learning. The success of this Phase I SBIR project will result in a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications and MOA of new compounds based on their EEG profiles. In a future Phase II project, we will 1) add in auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) database, 2) test our EEGCube by conducting a phenotypic drug discovery project with our established collaborator (see letters of support), 3) investigate whether integrating the EEGcube database with our SmartCube® database of same compounds helps better understand the circuitry responsible for behavioral responses and/or achieves even greater prediction power in identifying therapeutic indication of novel compounds and 4) explore EEG signatures of transgenic mouse models of disease and investigate use of their signatures to identify potential therapies for the respective diseases based on EEG. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an unmet need to improve success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders due to the high rate of failure. Given the high degree of translatability of electroencephalogram (EEG) from rodents to humans, PsychoGenics, Inc., proposes to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications, underlying mechanism of action, and/or compound liabilities to guide the early stages of drug development.","Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders",9846025,R43MH121136,"['Animal Model', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Auditory Evoked Potentials', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacologic Actions', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rights', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'clinically relevant', 'drug classification', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'side effect', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NIMH,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2019,449973,0.08505520920043394
"A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis PROJECT SUMMARY This project will address the critical need for new and effective antitubercular drugs. Our primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis tolerates antitubercular drug treatment. Our motivating hypothesis is that M. tuberculosis tolerates drug induced stress by differentially regulating detoxification enzymes, efflux pumps, metabolic activity, pellicle-forming factors, and cell wall remodeling systems. Further, we postulate that a secondary drug targeting one or few regulators of these tolerance strategies will potentiate the primary drug-treatment, and potentially reduce the emergence of resistance. We propose a systems biology approach to generate a network perspective of drug-induced tolerance mechanisms and how they are coordinated by one or few regulators that could be targeted for overcoming drug-specific tolerance using combinatorial treatment regimens. Hence, the innovation of our proposed research emerges from integrating network characterization of drug- specific tolerance mechanisms into the rational discovery of novel drug combinations. In Aim 1, we will transcriptionally profile M. tuberculosis following treatment with ten selected drugs (primary drugs). Using techniques developed in our laboratory, differentially expressed genes will be mapped onto a systems-scale gene regulatory network model of M. tuberculosis to infer drug-specific tolerance sub-networks and elucidate key regulators. We will also identify tolerance sub-networks by generating genome-wide fitness profiles in the presence of the selected primary drugs. Drug-associated fitness defects will reveal genes that are important for dealing with drug-induced stress and are hypothesized to cluster together in drug-specific tolerance sub-networks. In Aim 2, we will transcriptionally profile ~250 secondary drugs and perform combination high-throughput screens of all primary and secondary drug combinations. Data from these studies will be used to iteratively refine the model and develop a machine learning algorithm to identify gene- and network-level features that are predictive of synergistic drug interactions. Finally, mechanism of synergistic drug combinations will be characterized by selectively perturbing the predicted regulators of the tolerance sub-networks. This project will propel the development of systems biology tools to accurately predict novel synergistic drug combinations, thereby guiding experimental assessment and accelerating the delivery of new treatments to patients with tuberculosis infection. PROJECT NARRATIVE Treatment of tuberculosis infection (responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually) is complicated by the impermeable cell wall structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its intrinsic ability to adapt and withstand drug treatment, a phenomenon called tolerance. Thus, an urgent goal of antitubercular drug discovery is to overcome drug tolerance. This project will deepen our understanding of how M. tuberculosis responds to and thereby tolerates drug treatment and will use this systems-scale understanding to develop a predictive framework for identifying new synergistically acting drug combinations for the treatment of tuberculosis.",A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9594144,R01AI128215,"['Address', 'Antitubercular Agents', 'Cell Wall', 'Cessation of life', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Enzymes', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'combinatorial', 'differential expression', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'fitness', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'response', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transposon sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis drugs', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2019,902060,0.14216128145974083
"Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis Project Summary Clinical trials are foundational to evidence-based medicine, but results reporting from trials is incomplete and frequently delayed. It is estimated that as many as half of clinical trials are not published and as many as half of published trials underreport or misreport outcomes. This type of results reporting distorts the evidence available to clinicians—particularly when it comes to assessing the safety of interventions like drugs and devices—and may place patients at unnecessary risk. There is a critical need for novel methods to identify and monitor drug safety data. Through the infrastructure provided by ClinicalTrials.gov, structured trial results (including safety findings) are now becoming available for an increasing number of trials in a comprehensive and timely fashion. However, access and use of these data in evidence synthesis tasks remain limited. ClinicalTrials.gov is the largest single registry for clinical studies worldwide and includes more than 260,000 registered studies. Of the 108,941 completed trials registered with the site, 20% have uploaded results data for a total of 7.85 million participants. Results data reported on ClinicalTrials.gov have the potential to fill gaps created by delays and biases in published articles and provide an earlier and more complete overview of available trial evidence. We propose to develop novel informatics approaches based on combinations of information retrieval and machine learning methods to facilitate access and analysis of trial results reported in this registry. Focusing on trials testing drug interventions in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and oncology, we perform this work in three specific aims: 1) Develop semi-automated trial screening for identifying and aggregating trials relevant to a clinical intervention; 2) Extract adverse event and safety outcomes data from results reported in the registry; and 3) Perform validation studies to assess detection of adverse events and performance of semi- automated meta-analyses of safety outcomes. Methods developed in this project will facilitate timely, broad- scale use of trial results reported on ClinicalTrials.gov in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data. All methods will be made publicly available in order to support adverse event monitoring and systematic reviews of drug interventions. Project Narrative The availability of results from clinical trials is frequently incomplete or delayed, limiting the evidence available to clinicians making treatment decisions. When results on the safety of interventions, such as drugs, are not properly disseminated, patients may be exposed to harm. National policies require comprehensive and timely reporting of trial results in trial registries (e.g. ClinicalTrials.gov), representing a novel data type that could be used for drug safety surveillance. However, the use of these data has remained limited to date. We propose innovative informatics methods to enable access and analysis of this emerging data source in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data.",Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis,9641903,R01LM012976,"['Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Bibliographic Databases', 'Bibliography', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consumption', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug usage', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse event monitoring', 'base', 'cluster trial', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'drug testing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medication safety', 'novel', 'oncology', 'rosiglitazone', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'trial design', 'validation studies', 'vector']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,347250,0.03628187009531532
"DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are dangerous and expensive, afflicting about 1.5% of hospitalized patients with profound health and financial consequences. In Medicare patients alone, adverse drug reactions account for 19% of total spending ($339 billion), more than 1,900 deaths, and more than 77,000 extra hospital days per year. Idiosyncratic ADRs, especially rare and severe hypersensitivity-driven ADRs, are the leading cause of medicine withdrawal and termination of clinical development. At the same time, a large proportion of drugs are not associated with hypersensitivity driven ADRs, offering hope that new medicines could avoid them entirely with reliable predictors of risk. Hypersensitivity driven ADRs are caused by the formation of chemically reactive metabolites by metabolic enzymes. These reactive metabolites covalently attach to proteins to become immunogenic and provoke an ADR. Unfortunately, current computational and experimental approaches do not reliably identify drug candidates that form reactive metabolites. These approaches are limited because they inadequately model metabolism, which can both render toxic molecules safe and safe molecules toxic. To overcome this limitation, the proposed study aims to curate a public database of metabolism and reactivity and use this database to build accurate and validated mathematical models of metabolism and reactivity. The models will be constructed using machine-learning algorithms that quantitatively summarize the knowledge from thousands of published studies. The Aims are to (1) curate a database of metabolism and build models that identify rules governing the structure of reaction products during drug metabolism in the liver, (2) curate a database of reactivity and build improved reactivity models that mechanistically predict which metabolites are reactive with biological molecules, and (3) curate a database of reactive metabolites and combine these models to predict when molecules form reactive metabolites that covalently bind proteins. The computational models generated by these Aims will be validated through statistical approaches and against bench-top experiments. Taken together, this approach will substantially improve on existing approaches by more accurately modeling the properties determining whether metabolism renders drugs toxic or safe. The predictive models will make new medicines safer by helping researchers avoid molecules prone to ADRs without harming patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse drug reactions, especially rare but severe hypersensitivity-driven reactions, have profound financial and health implications and are caused by reactive drug metabolites. As an extension of tools and data developed by our groups, we will build and test mathematical models and datasets that more accurately predict when molecules form clinically important reactive metabolites than current methodologies, such as “structural alerts.” We will use these models to build a tool that will better predict when drug candidates form reactive metabolites, which will make new medicines safer by enabling researchers to avoid drug candidates prone to causing adverse reactions.",DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY,9742516,R01LM012222,"['Adverse reactions', 'Assessment tool', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Activation', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Relative Risks', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Stevens-Johnson Syndrome', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'Withdrawal', 'adduct', 'adverse drug reaction', 'clinical development', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug metabolism', 'drug withdrawal', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'liver metabolism', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macromolecule', 'mathematical model', 'model building', 'novel', 'online repository', 'predictive modeling', 'protein function', 'quantum', 'repository', 'screening', 'tool']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,374026,0.050695012992965666
"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Project Summary We have recently used computational models to identify the protease inhibitor indinavir (used as an antiviral for HIV) as a positive allosteric modulator at the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. We now propose to build on this discovery as well as other publications describing compounds that are positive allosteric modulators of the α7- nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. We propose identifying further compounds that possess activity against this or one of 9 other targets implicated in Alzheimer’s disease using a combination of Bayesian machine learning and in vitro assays. Generating such data will enable us to potentially provide more specific compounds as well as building datasets that can be used to build predictive models to identify additional compounds with activity at these Alzheimer’s targets. These combined efforts should in the first instance provide commercially viable treatments which will be used to experimentally validate our computational models that can be shared with the Alzheimer’s disease scientific community. We are proposing to build and validate models based on public databases, select compounds for testing and use the data generated as a starting point for further optimization. Project Narrative Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders that causes dementia and it is characterized by amyloid deposition of a 39-42 AA peptide (Aβ) processed from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Many palliative drugs are available for the disease but there is still an urgent need for curative drugs with greater efficacy. We need to understand the key factors involved in disease progression and their suitability as drug targets for discovering new drugs against Alzheimer's disease. We hence propose to study several of these targets for Alzheimer’s disease involving all the key steps in the pathway, including several old and new targets. We will use our ‘Assay Central’ software to compile structure-activity data for building computational models, that can be used to selected compounds to test activity in vitro as a starting point for further optimization.",Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations,9881110,R44GM122196,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Assay', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'HIV', 'Indinavir', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Publications', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'alpha-bungarotoxin receptor', 'base', 'drug discovery', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro activity', 'novel therapeutics', 'palliative', 'positive allosteric modulator', 'predictive modeling']",NIGMS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R44,2019,188759,-0.021410382718207353
"Robust Inference from Observational Data with Distributed Representations of Conceptual Relations The need to monitor unintended effects of approved drugs has been highlighted by several recent high-profile events in which fatal side effects of drugs were detected after their release to market. Notoriously, the Cox-2 inhibitor rofecoxib (Vioxx) was withdrawn from market on account of evidence suggesting that treatment with the drug increased the rate of myocardial infarction. More recently, proton pump inhibitors have been identified with a host of previously undetected serious side effects, including chronic kidney disease. Statistical analyses of several sorts of data have been undertaken in an effort to mitigate the morbitidy and mortality resulting from such side effects by accelerating their detection. These include data from adverse event reporting systems, Electronic Health Records (EHR) and administrative claims data, social media communication and consumer search logs. Each of these sources presents challenges related to data completeness, accuracy, quality and representation, as well as the potential for bias. Though methods for combining multiple data sources show some promise as a way to address their particular inadequacies, strongly correlated drug-event pairs emerging from secondary analysis of observational data must ultimately be reviewed by domain experts to assess their implications. As the availability of the prerequisite expertise is limited, there is a pressing need for new methods to distinguish plausibly causal relationships from the large number of false positive associations that may emerge from large-scale analysis of observational data. In the proposed research, we will develop automated methods through which large amounts of knowledge extracted from the biomedical literature are used to constrain the parameterization of predictive models of large data sets. These methods will leverage high-dimensional distributed vector representations of conceptual relations extracted from the literature to integrate extracted knowledge into predictive models of observational data. Our hypothesis is that the predictions that result from such joint models will be both biologically plausible and strongly associated, resulting in more accurate predictions than those that can be obtained through estimation of correlation from observational data alone. The developed methods will be evaluated formatively for accuracy against a set of drug/side-effect reference standards, and summatively for their ability to to predict label changes such as “black box” warnings using historical data and knowledge to estimate their “time-to-detection” of safety concerns. In addition, we will develop and evaluate an interactive interface permitting users to explore the evidence used by the resulting models to make predictions, by retrieving supporting assertions from the literature and statistics from observational data. If successful, the proposed research will provide the means to identify plausible drug-event pairs for regulatory purposes, mitigating consequent morbidity and mortality. In addition, the methods will provide a generalizable approach that can be used to apply knowledge derived from the biomedical literature to draw robust inferences from observational clinical data.

"Motion Sequencing for Neuropsychiatric Drug Development SUMMARY Neuropsychiatric disorders afflict more than 20% of the global population, resulting enormous personal and societal burdens, including trillions of dollars in total costs. Despite its prevalence and widespread impact, the development of drugs to treat neuropsychiatric diseases significantly lags behind other disease areas. This gap is due primarily to the fact that so few candidate drugs ever make it to the clinic; the average lag time for those that do make it is 13 years, further exacerbating the problem. The success rate for psychiatric drugs is historically low, even as financial investments in the area rise. Developing safe and effective drugs for neuropsychiatric disorders is inherently difficult, as it relies on characterizing the behavioral phenotypes of animal models. Current approaches to this are low-throughput, unreliable, expensive, and minimally informative. Most methods attempt to reduce complex behaviors that depend upon many neural circuits into one or a few quantifiable metrics, which are then used to predict how the candidates will impact the even more complex human nervous system. Syllable Life Sciences was founded on the vision of improving the way we measure and interpret changes in the behavior in the lab to improve pre-clinical drug development. To address this challenge, we have developed a behavioral analysis platform called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq). MoSeq combines machine vision and unsupervised machine learning techniques to objectively identify a set of stereotyped three-dimensional behavioral motifs (rears, turns, head-bobs, runs, pauses, etc.) that encapsulates all the spontaneous actions of mice within a particular experiment. In addition to revealing which motif (termed a “behavioral syllable”) is expressed at each moment, MoSeq identifies the statistics that govern how syllables transition from one to anther over time (“behavioral grammar”). Using MoSeq, therefore, we can comprehensively and quantitatively profile rodent behavior. Our previous work demonstrates that MoSeq directly reflects ongoing brain activity in psychiatry- relevant brain circuits, and that it may significantly outperform more standard methods of phenotyping drug effects in mice. In this SBIR Phase I project, we propose to extend the capabilities of MoSeq and explicitly demonstrate its translational value. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will expand the purview of MoSeq to include neuropsychiatry-relevant circuits; in Aim 2 we will build a behavioral space that describes relationships among drugs spanning the current psychopharmacopeia; and in Aim 3 we will demonstrate the clinical utility of MoSeq by using it to predict clinical trial outcomes. This project will lay essential groundwork for revolutionizing the preclinical pipeline for neuro- and psychotherapeutics. NARRATIVE Syllable Life Sciences is committed to addressing key preclinical bottlenecks that hinder neuropsychiatric drug development. Key to this is to develop more efficient and accurate ways to identify and measure drug impact on behavior in model systems. Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) integrates state-of-the-art 3D cameras and novel machine learning techniques to track changes in rodent behavior in response to drug, and it does so with unprecedented levels of accuracy and temporal resolution.

"A knowledge map to find Alzheimer's disease drugs To stem the rising incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in our aging population, new methods to repurpose and combine drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) are acutely required. This is a challenge, however, because the complex polygenic basis of AD remains opaque, and rational methods to repurpose drugs are in early years, even for well-defined gene targets. To address these problems, we propose new algorithms to integrate data on a very large scale so as to combine evolutionary information and high-throughput experimental observations with the knowledge conveyed by text in the literature. First, to detect disease-relevant genome variations in AD patients, Aim 1 will combine a novel mathematical calculus of mutational landscapes with machine learning, in so doing suggesting primary candidate genes for drug targeting based on signs of mutational selection in cases or controls. Next, to repurpose and combine drugs targeting these genes, Aim 2 will map a large fraction of all that is known about genes, phenotypes, and drugs into a single high-dimensional network that represents their interactions as described in various databases (structured data) and in the literature (unstructured data). The topology of this network will determine the optimal choice of single drug or combination therapy in an approach that can be personalized. Finally, to validate efficacy experimentally, Aim 3 will test both our candidate genes and drugs with state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo screens. Feasibility rests with prior studies on evolution, networks, systems, and text-mining that demonstrate accurate predictions of deleterious mutations and their clinical sequelae and the discovery of drivers of diseases. Broadly, this work will yield proof of principle for a novel quantitative model that integrates fundamental concepts from mathematics and molecular evolution, and for a low resolution but large-scale map of biomedical knowledge in which network notions of distance computed by machine learning identify relevant functional hypothesis that would otherwise be easily overlooked. The result will be a new experimental ability to unravel the genotype-phenotype relationship in Alzheimer's Disease so as to guide drug therapy. Alzheimer's is a devastating disease projected to rise dramatically in our aging population. To develop drugs against it, we propose to train machine learning on the DNA of patients with Alzheimer's to detect genes with abnormal mathematical features in their mutations. Then, we will place these genes in a “map”, which represents a large fraction of biomedical knowledge in a high-dimensional network. The drugs that fall near our genes of interest in this map are our candidates, and experiments will test in cell and mouse models whether they affect the hallmark signs of Alzheimer's.",A knowledge map to find Alzheimer's disease drugs,9787309,R01AG061105,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor', 'Animal Model', 'Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Behavior', 'Calculi', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Equilibrium', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Production', 'PubMed', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'database structure', 'disorder risk', 'drug testing', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'interest', 'molecular modeling', 'mouse model', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'protective factors', 'screening', 'stem', 'success', 'synergism', 'tau Proteins', 'text searching', 'virtual']",NIA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,792498,-0.023424273327951366
"Developing a systems biology platform for predicting, preventing, and treating drug side effects Project Summary Adverse drug reactions (ADRs), more commonly known as drug side effects, are estimated to cause over 200,000 deaths in the US annually, are responsible for 6.5% of all hospital admissions, and 28% of clinical trial failures. ADRs are estimated to increase healthcare costs by $136 billion per year in the USA alone. Current safety and modeling efforts that are commonly used in the pharma industry (such as PK/PD) do not elucidate the complex pathophysiology underlying ADRs. These safety and modeling approaches are used predominantly to quantitatively understand exposure-response relationships for clinical dosing, but with a few exceptions do not focus on the cellular pharmacodynamic mechanisms of why drugs cause ADRs. Elucidating the downstream and systemic effects of pharmaceuticals is critical to understanding ADR pathogenesis and developing safer therapies. Drugs can affect multiple proteins and each protein that they modulate may play roles in multiple cellular processes. Systems biology and bioinformatics approaches coupled with machine learning are crucial for understanding the multi-factorial pathophysiology of ADRs. In Phase I of this program, we developed an in vitro transcriptomics based computational platform that 1) predicts drug-side effect liability equivalent to current gold-standard approaches that require considerably more information about the compound and its effects, 2) defines genes that are relevant to ADR pathophysiology, and 3) identifies therapeutically beneficial compounds for the ADR. Based on the computational platform, we discovered a repurposing opportunity for an off-patent, non-FDA approved drug in Parkinson’s Disease that we are currently pursuing towards clinical development. This drug significantly improves levodopa’s efficacy, without exacerbating the drug’s major side effect which often precludes levodopa’s use. In Phase II of this proposal, we will continue to develop and expand the ADR computational platform. Further, we will hone our focus on two key clinically and commercially relevant ADRs: antipsychotic induced tardive dyskinesia and radio-/chemo- therapy induced mucosal inflammation. We will generate rich datasets for these ADRs to both validate our in vitro platform with in vivo data and to understand the pathophysiology of these ADRs at an unprecedented level. Further, we will use the datasets to generate computational predictions for discovering/repurposing drugs to improve safety in psychiatric and cancer treatments. The best predictions will be subsequently tested in vitro and developed through partnerships and external funding mechanisms. Project Narrative Adverse drug reactions, more commonly known as drug side effects, cause over 200,000 deaths in the US annually, are responsible for 6.5% of all hospital admissions, and 28% of clinical trial failures. This proposal will continue development and deploy a computational platform that predict drug side effects' mechanisms for safer drug development and better patient outcomes. The predictive platform will be applied for improving cancer and psychiatric treatments.","Developing a systems biology platform for predicting, preventing, and treating drug side effects",9777393,R44GM121117,"['Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Economic Burden', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Expression Profiling', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Levodopa', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Mucositis', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Radio', 'Reporting', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Tardive Dyskinesia', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'adverse drug reaction', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical development', 'commercialization', 'computational platform', 'data pipeline', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'metabolomics', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-patent', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,"SINOPIA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2019,802538,0.10915162790165232
"Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a suite of software modules to enable scientists to unambiguously represent chemical mixtures in standard machine-readable formats, filling an urgent and widely-recognized need. Chemicals are typically formulated as mixtures. Recording and communicating information about chemical mixtures is essential for scientists and support staff in the pharmaceutical industry, in academia, in non-profit research organizations, in government, at specialty chemical vendors, and at commercial manufacturers to: • discover, develop, formulate, manufacture and regulate drugs; • manage reagent inventories; comply with laboratory safety requirements; inform first responders; • describe and reproduce biomedical experiments; and • assess and disseminate information about toxicity risks of chemical reagents and consumer products.  A working committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is close to formalizing “Mixtures InChI” (or MInChI), which will extend the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) to become the first standard to encompass mixtures. MInChI will effectively index mixtures in the same way that InChI indexes individual compounds.  CDD will first develop the data structures and software necessary to enable adoption and utilization of MInChI and create the first general-purpose system for recording information about chemical mixtures that is computable and interoperable. The most innovative part of the project and the bulk of the effort will be to develop a sophisticated automated translation tool that will accurately convert legacy catalogs of chemical mixtures from plaintext descriptions or ad hoc formats so that they are properly represented in a machine readable format that can in turn be easily rendered into MInChI identifiers. The broad vision is to help industry to overcome the barriers to adoption so that MInChI can quickly deliver benefits for drug discovery, chemical safety, and toxicology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accurately document the composition of chemical mixtures in a format that computers can easily interpret, process, and exchange. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. It will also help to advance our understanding of the toxicology of mixtures (which often differs from the toxicology of individual components) and improve laboratory safety both in industry and in educational settings. !",Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation,9826639,R43TR002528,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Government', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Readability', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shorthand', 'Solvents', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'consumer product', 'data structure', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'first responder', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R43,2019,54833,0.03848235905127521
"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,9792242,P50AR070590,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Custom', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Ohio', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Provider', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'Records', 'Records Controls', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Model', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'design', 'differential expression', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'multimodality', 'mycobiome', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'synergism', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIAMS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,P50,2019,1308373,0.03608675108615172
"Comprehensive but simple encoding of bioassays to accelerate translational drug discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to extend its innovative software platform — BioAssay Express (BAE, version 1.0) — which helps biologists to quickly and easily encode their plain-text biological assay protocols into formats suitable for computational processing. In Phase 2B, CDD will further enhance BAE so that it can markup a bioassay with a comprehensive, detailed set of annotations that completely specifies the protocol, step by step. In its current state of development in Phase 2, BAE 1.0 enables scientists to summarize the English language text that specifies an experimental protocol, supplementing it with machine-interpretable descriptors. At the end of Phase 2B, BAE 2.0 will output a detailed machine- interpretable version that will be completely equivalent to, and can optionally substitute for, the traditional English language method description. The enhanced BAE 2.0 software will enable scientists engaged in early stage drug discovery to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures and intelligently aggregate datasets across research groups. An important benefit will be facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility by (1) flagging differences between closely related assays; (2) correlating differences in protocols with differences in results; and (3) improving the reproducibility of experiments conducted in different laboratories, to highlight potential causes of divergences. The project will continue to leverage the related broad initiatives at NIH and elsewhere that are working to promote translational research, gather screening data via open repositories, and apply sophisticated ontologies to classify these datasets. Our project targets the intersection of these disparate initiatives and unifies them by making their complex standards and guidelines for praxis realistically accessible to researchers who want to focus on their scientific work To encourage adoption, the software will prioritize intuitive ease of use by scientists who are not informatics experts, harmonize with existing laboratory workflows, minimize the extra effort of annotation, integrate seamlessly into preclinical data management platforms (including but not limited to CDD’s own CDD Vault), and deliver clear and immediate benefits to the user as part of an integrated experience. This combination of new capabilities and extreme ease of use will accelerate translational drug discovery efforts by empowering software platforms that bridge the divide between biologists and medicinal chemists to apply sophisticated tools — long available on the chemistry side — for the first time also to the biological side, and thus across both domains. Existing software can already easily connect screening results to chemical structures. This new platform will further connect these data to the purpose and methodology of the screens. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures, thereby facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility of data and assays. This fundamental capability ultimately accelerates translating new experimental discoveries into the development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. These tools will particularly benefit networks of researchers working on diseases that leading pharmaceutical companies have largely ignored because they are not perceived as highly profitable opportunities, despite the fact that in many cases they afflict millions of people.",Comprehensive but simple encoding of bioassays to accelerate translational drug discovery,9608807,R44TR000185,"['Academia', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'English Language', 'Ensure', 'Experimental Designs', 'Government', 'Guidelines', 'Improve Access', 'Incentives', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Intelligence', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Screening Result', 'Semantics', 'Side', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'biomedical ontology', 'computerized tools', 'data management', 'drug discovery', 'empowered', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repository', 'robotic system', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2019,754441,0.01254012897821349
"Omics data integration and analysis for structure-based multi-target drug design Abstract Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), whole genome sequencing, and high-throughput techniques have generated vast amounts of diverse omics and phenotypic data. However, these sets of data have not yet been fully explored to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery, which continues along the one- drug-one-gene paradigm. Consequently, the cost of bringing a drug to market is staggering, and the failure rate is daunting. Our long-term goal is to revive the lagging pharmaceutical pipeline by identifying robust methods for achieving precision medicine. We will achieve this goal by developing a novel structural systems pharmacology approach to drug discovery, which integrates structure-based drug design with heterogeneous omics data integration and analysis in the context of the whole human and pathogen genome and interactome. An increasing body of evidence from both our group and others suggests that most drugs commonly interact with multiple receptors (targets). Both strong and weak multiple drug-target interactions can collectively mediate drug efficacy, toxicity, and resistance through the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. In order to rationally design potent, safe, and precision medicine, we face one of the major unsolved challenges in structure-based drug design: what are all the possible proteins and their conformational states interacting with a drug in an organism? This proposal attempts to address this challenge by developing, disseminating, and experimentally testing novel computational tools. Based on our successful preliminary results, we will develop an integrated computational pipeline to identify three-dimensional (3D) protein-chemical interaction models in the cellular context and on a structural proteome scale. Specifically, we will develop a quaternary structure- centric multi-layered network model by integrating heterogeneous data from genomics, proteomics, and phenomics. We will develop a novel collaborative one-class collaborative filtering algorithm to infer missing relations in the multi-layered network. We will combine tools derived from structural bioinformatics, biophysics, and machine learning to gain biological insights into the drug action. To facilitate the usability and reproducibility of the proposed algorithms, we will develop community-based web resources established by our previous experiences in developing the Protein Data Bank (PDB). More importantly, we will work closely with experimental laboratories to test the proposed computational tools using targeted kinase polypharmacology as a real-world example, and iteratively improve the performance and usability of algorithm, software, and web services. The successful completion of this project will provide the scientific community with: (1) new methods to enhance the scope and capability of high-throughput screening for structure-based multi-target drug design; (2) a user-friendly web service to support community-based drug discovery; and (3) potential novel anti-cancer targeted therapeutics. Together, these tools will advance drug discovery and precision medicine by providing a structural systems pharmacology toolkit. Relevance Statement The pharmaceutical industry is in a dire state. Both the cost to launch a new drug and the attrition rate are increasing.

"Social Media Mining for Pharmacovigilance Project Summary Drugs undergo extensive testing in animals and clinical trials in humans before they are marketed for widespread use. Pre-market testing produces reasonably high quality information about the efficacy of the drug as a treatment for the condition for which it was approved, but gives a very incomplete picture of the drug's safety. It is only after a drug is marketed and used on a more widespread basis over longer periods of time that it is possible to identify other effects, such as rare but serious adverse effects, or those that are more common in the special subgroups excluded from the trial (such as pregnant women), or effects of long-term use of the drug, among others. Despite the increase in research in the past years exploring social media data for pharmacovigilance, and the evidence that it indeed can bring forward the patient perspective, there is no systematic approach to collect and annotate such data for research purposes. This renewal builds on our prior research and natural language processing (NLP) methods for social media mining in pharmacovigilance to make the collection of social media data about medication use precise and systematic enough to be useful to researchers and the public, alongside established sources such as the FDA's data and other public collections of drug adverse event data. It presents innovative methods to automatically collect and analyze longitudinal health data, piloting methods for interventions through the same media that can inform the public and help validate the automatic methods. As validation, we include a comparison to an existing reference standard for adverse effects that integrates FDA's data and HER data, as well as specific case studies focused on (Aim 3.1) the use of NSAIDs and anti-depressants in pregnancy and (Aim 3.2) factors for non-adherence.

"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity.

"Doctor Shopping for Controlled Substances: Insights from Two-Mode Social Network Analysis The proposed project will analyze patterns of doctor shopping for prescription opioids and benzodiazepines using two-mode (i.e. affiliation) social network analysis (SNA). Abuse of prescription opioids and benzodiazepines in the U.S. has risen rapidly, creating a public health crisis. Mortality from drug overdose is higher than motor vehicle accidents and is among the nation's leading preventable causes of death. Doctor shopping is defined as obtaining controlled substances from multiple health care practitioners simultaneously, exceeding the recommended dosage. Doctor shopping is a principle method of obtaining controlled substances for misuse, and an indicator of escalating drug abuse that is associated with a two-fold risk for fatal overdose. Lack of consensus about criteria for classifying doctor shopping has led to wide variation in estimated rates of questionable prescribing activity. This ambiguity poses barriers to understanding factors underlying doctor shopping, and impedes the evaluation of prescription drug policies. Currently, numerical thresholds or multiple provider episodes (MPEs; i.e. overlapping prescriptions) are most often used to identify doctor shoppers, resulting in false positives and negatives. A goal of the proposed study is to determine whether incorporating information about actors' structural position in a two-mode social network of patients and prescribers can produce more valid indictors of illicit behavior. Two-mode network analysis focuses on ties between two different classes or sets of entities. In the proposed project, data form a two-mode network with prescribers in one class and patients in the other, and ties are present only between prescribers and patients. Two-mode SNA is ideal for examining structural patterns in social interaction between two sets of actors, and for determining the most active and central actors in a network. Consistently targeting prescribers that are key players in prescription drug networks may be indicative of strategic doctor shopping behavior or information sharing among patients. Insights from SNA will be used to fine-tune doctor-shopping indicators, improving our ability to detect early signs of abuse, as well as behavior that is intermittent, ambiguous, or less intense, but still problematic. The specific aims of the proposed study are to: 1) Utilize SNA to develop and assess network- based metrics of doctor shopping in comparison to traditional indicators; and 2) Identify characteristics of doctor shopping patients, targeted prescribers, and the point of service. To our knowledge, this is the first study of prescription drug abuse to use two-mode SNA as its methodological approach. This study is significant in applying two-mode SNA – a complex, systems science methodology – to drug abuse research and has the potential to facilitate cost-effective information extraction from extant datasets for translation to policy and practice. The long-term goal of this research is to leverage insights from SNA to improve detection and prevention of doctor shopping and related fraudulent activities, and ultimately reduce the prevalence and public health impact of prescription drug abuse. Abuse of prescription opioids and benzodiazepines has reached epidemic status, and is currently among the nation’s leading preventable causes of death. The proposed research examines social network ties between patients and their prescribing clinicians in a large insurance claims database to identify patterns of prescription seeking that indicate fraudulent activity (e.g. doctor shopping) and possible information sharing among patients who abuse prescription drugs. The goals of this research are to improve detection of early, intermittent, and ambiguous signs of prescription drug abuse behaviors, and to better understand characteristics of patients who engage in doctor shopping and the clinicians they target.",Doctor Shopping for Controlled Substances: Insights from Two-Mode Social Network Analysis,9729675,R01DA039928,"['Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Doctor shopping', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug abuse', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Services', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Solo Practices', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Translations', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'care coordination', 'cost effective', 'dosage', 'drug seeking behavior', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insight', 'insurance claims', 'learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'operation', 'prescription drug abuse', 'prescription monitoring program', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid abuse', 'response', 'sociodemographics', 'standard measure', 'substance misuse', 'trend', 'vehicular accident']",NIDA,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2019,317590,0.023229045671444765
"Drug Benefit Design and Adherence Disparities in Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract Underuse of clinically effective medications among minority adults in midlife may contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in chronic disease related morbidity and mortality in late life. Medication affordability has been identified as an important driver of disparities in treatment adherence and recent trends in employer-sponsored prescription drug coverage toward increased patient cost sharing (e.g., copays) have the potential to exacerbate these disparities. Yet, there is a paucity of strong research evidence on the effects of out-of-pocket (OOP) drug costs on disparities in treatment adherence over the life course. In a prior study, we found evidence of a complex relationship between OOP drug costs and adherence which likely differs by race and ethnicity over time. For example, as patients age and OOP costs increase due to higher drug burden, patients may become more sensitive to cumulative drug costs regardless of race or ethnicity. In addition, potentially modifiable factors at the provider (e.g., prescribing habits) and health system level (e.g., refill complexity) may interact with OOP drug costs in ways that exacerbate adherence disparities in midlife. However, our prior study could not adequately explore these complex and interacting factors. The primary objective of this competing renewal is to estimate the effect of OOP drug costs on disparities in medication adherence among middle-aged adults (40-64) within a large integrated health care setting (>4 million members) offering a wide variety of drug benefits and consistent access to primary care. We hypothesize that the relationship between OOP drug costs and racial and ethnic differences in adherence will be modified by age. In addition, we will examine potential interactions between OOP drug costs and modifiable factors at the provider and health system level that may amplify disparities in adherence. Focusing on patients with cardiometabolic conditions (i.e., hypertension, diabetes) and select medication classes (e.g., lipid lowering, antihypertensives, antidiabetes), we will leverage a rich longitudinal electronic medical record and employ rigorous statistical methods to estimate the effect of OOP drug costs on medication adherence overall and by race and ethnicity, including examining age-specific effects and interactions between OOP drug costs and modifiable factors at the provider and health system level. In addition, we will identify aids and barriers to integrating health equity as a measurable criterion for evaluating drug benefit designs and relevant contextual factors from the perspective of decision makers (e.g., employers, health plans, pharmacy benefit managers). If successful the proposed study has the potential to inform the design of drug benefits that simultaneously promote clinical effectiveness and equitable health care outcomes. Narrative Underuse of clinically effective medications among minority adults in midlife may contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in chronic disease related morbidity and mortality in late life. The primary objective of this competing renewal is to enhance our understanding of the relationship between out-of-pocket drug costs and disparities in adherence to evidence-based treatments in midlife and to inform the design of drug benefits that simultaneously promote clinical effectiveness and equitable health care outcomes.",Drug Benefit Design and Adherence Disparities in Older Adults,9990921,R56AG032249,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Sharing', 'Deductibles', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health system', 'Hypertension', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Lipids', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mail Order', 'Measurable', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural experiment', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'cardiometabolism', 'care outcomes', 'contextual factors', 'cost', 'design', 'ethnic difference', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'health equity', 'health plan', 'medication compliance', 'member', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'pharmacy benefit', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial difference', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment disparity', 'trend', 'uptake']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R56,2019,736746,0.048894814090019535
"Pharmacokinetic Tomography for the Measurement of Topical Drug Product Bioequivalence Project Summary The lack of accurate and reliable techniques for visualizing and quantifying the delivery and uptake (pharmacokinetics) of small molecules into the skin has been a major challenge in the development of both new and generic topical drugs. This is particularly true in the measurement of bioequivalence, where a generic drug candidate must be compared against a reference brand-label drug. Current methods, which rely on expensive, destructive, and bulk measurements do not provide the spatial or temporal resolution necessary to extract pharmacokinetic profiles to determine equivalence of drugs at the cellular level over time in human skin. New tools, which allow for direct, real-time quantification of pharmacokinetics non-invasively in humans are needed to drive innovation in the topical drug space. Pharmacokinetic Tomography (PKT) is a method of generated three-dimensional, real-time maps of various molecular species such as lipids, water, proteins and drugs in tissue using spectroscopic imaging techniques. These imaging techniques make use of the intrinsic molecular vibrations of drug molecules to track their uptake quantitatively without the need for labels or alterations to molecular structure. This proposal will develop new coherent Raman imaging tools to create a platform for quantifying the behavior of drugs in ex vivo human skin. This PKT-based platform will be able to measure the uptake of drugs such as antibiotics, kinase inhibitors, steroids, retinoids and NSAIDs in the skin with sub-cellular and sub-second time resolution to glean critical pharmacokinetic parameters needed for drug development and bioequivalence measurements. To compare PKT to an FDA-recognized standard, these PKT imaging will be carried out alongside dermal open flow microperfusion (dOFM), a skin fluid sampling technique that measures the concentration of drugs over time. The multimodal PKT platform, when completed, will be able to measure the bioequivalence of various drugs in situ in human subjects. This research program will specifically develop new imaging toolkits that combine advanced microscopy with state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning analysis techniques to collect and extract pharmacokinetic data. Using a new type of versatile laser, we will create a coherent Raman technique ideal for detection of drug molecules which contain unique chemical structures. In order to broaden the applicability of the platform to a far wider range of potential drug molecules, we will develop a sparse sampling coherent Raman imaging approach that will quantify molecules by their unique combinations of molecular structures. The development and approval of topical generic drugs for treating dermatological conditions has been slow due to the difficulty and cost in establishing bioequivalence of potential drugs using existing pharmacokinetic profiling methods. For this reason, there is a major need for techniques that can enable the direct visualization and quantification of drugs as they flow and accumulate within tissue. This proposal seeks to develop Pharmacokinetic Tomography imaging tools that make use of the intrinsic molecular vibrational properties of drugs to create a platform translatable to human studies for the measurement of drug bioequivalence.",Pharmacokinetic Tomography for the Measurement of Topical Drug Product Bioequivalence,9913677,U01FD006698,[' '],FDA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U01,2019,499369,0.09912325031420013
"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects.

"Computationally modeling the impact of ontogeny on drug metabolic fate   ABSTRACT Advancements in pediatric drug development require innovative approaches that overcome challenges in assessing age-dependent drug disposition and toxic risks related to metabolism. Cytochromes P450 dominate drug metabolism yet roles for individual enzymes depend on genetics, disease states, co-medications, and ontogeny. Failure to account for those differences contributes to dosing challenges and possibly toxicity as reported for dextromethorphan, midazolam, and phenytoin. The NICHD Pediatric Formulation Initiative (PFI) workshops emphasized the need for better modeling to describe and predict how drug metabolism changes for children. Current pharmacokinetic models predict how drug clearance changes with age that affect the optimal dose, but those models are limited in two ways; (1) they require experimentally determined kinetic data for several enzymes that is not often available, and (2) they do not model formation of specific drug metabolites, which is important in predicting toxicity and drug interactions, regardless of whether clearance changes with age. We hypothesize that computational models of mixtures of P450 enzymes can predict how the “metabolic fate”, i.e. the kinetics of drug metabolism and the resulting metabolite structures, of drugs changes with age. We propose building hierarchical mathematical models that at first predict the drug metabolites formed by metabolic enzymes (Aim 1), then the efficiency of formation for each metabolite (the kinetics) (Aim 2), and combine these models to predict metabolites formed by age-specific mixtures of P450s (Aim 3). This proposal makes significant steps toward achieving PFI goals. First, datasets created for this study will be made publicly available to foster model refinement and validation by the community. Second, simulation of metabolite profiles would yield tractable biomarkers and support studies on possible age-dependent drug-drug interactions, off- target biological activities, pro-drug activation, and formation of toxic species. Third, the models will indicate, for both new and existing drugs, when metabolic fate (consequently, toxicity and interactions) changes in pediatric patients, even when pharmacokinetics stay the same. Fourth, though not the primary aim of this study, successfully modeling metabolic efficiency could enable pharmacokinetic studies for predicting problematic pediatric drugs prior to carrying out any necessary experimental kinetic studies. Taken together, this proposal lays a strong foundation for developing models relevant that resolve challenges in optimizing drug dosages and minimizing toxicity risks for children.   PROJECT NARRATIVE The impact of age on cytochrome P450 metabolism makes drug disposition and toxic risks moving targets for pediatric patients, such that robust strategies to identify and assess ontogenetic (age-dependent) effects on drug metabolic fate (in vitro kinetics and metabolite structures) are clearly needed to better personalize drug development for pediatric dosing. As an extension of our prior work, we will build and test computational models and datasets for individual P450 isozymes that accurately predict drug metabolites and the rate (kinetics) at which they form. We will then combine these models for an effective, low cost approach that simulates hepatic P450 metabolism and takes into account age-dependent contributions from individual isozymes to assess the metabolic fate of drugs during child development.  ",Computationally modeling the impact of ontogeny on drug metabolic fate,9762980,R01LM012482,"['Access to Information', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Chemical Models', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dextromethorphan', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Educational workshop', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Failure', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hepatic', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Isoenzymes', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Microsomes', 'Midazolam', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology and Toxicology', 'Phenytoin', 'Prodrugs', 'Property', 'Reaction', 'Recombinants', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxin', 'Validation', 'Work', 'absorption', 'age related', 'base', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'dosage', 'drug clearance', 'drug development', 'drug disposition', 'drug metabolism', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pediatric drug development', 'pediatric patients', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'repository', 'response', 'simulation', 'tool']",NLM,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2019,313125,0.10144328071766655
"Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization Project Summary  The proposed work will accelerate the pace of drug discovery by developing, validating, and testing new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug design. Two fundamental challenges of structure-based drug design are the accurate scoring and ranking of protein-ligand structures, which identiﬁes active com- pounds, and the ability to efﬁciently search a large number of ligands, which ensures that active compounds are sampled. This proposal will address these challenges by developing a novel approach for protein-ligand scoring and expanding the size of the chemical space that can be efﬁciently searched during lead optimiza- tion. The methods will be validated by their prospective application toward the discovery of new anti-cancer molecules and will be made readily accessible through online resources and open-source tools.  The proposal leverages recent and signiﬁcant advances in deep learning and image recognition to develop scoring functions that accurately recognize high-afﬁnity protein-ligand interactions. This is achieved by design- ing and training convolutional neural nets on three-dimensional representations of protein-ligand structures to discriminate between binders and non-binders. Convolutional neural net training will exploit large datasets of afﬁnity and structural data to automatically extract the relevant features necessary to accurately prioritize compounds. Additionally, the proposal develops the ﬁrst means of fully integrating a convolutional neural net scoring function directly into an energy minimization and docking workﬂow.  Interactive virtual screening enables the search of millions of compounds in a few seconds so that queries can be interactively optimized. Interactivity enables the synergistic uniﬁcation of human expert knowledge and efﬁcient computational algorithms. The proposed work will dramatically expand the size of chemical space ac- cessible through interactive virtual screening. Algorithms for efﬁciently searching the chemical space of billions or trillions of compounds implicitly deﬁned by a set of reaction schemas and fragments will be created as part of a lead optimization workﬂow. Fragment-oriented search will be accelerated by a new data structure that combines pharmacophore and molecular shape information into a single sub-linear time index.  The scoring and lead optimization methods developed in this proposal will be released as open-source soft- ware and made immediately available through open-access online resources. As part of the prospective valida- tion of the proposed methods, these resources will be used to identify hit compounds and optimize leads for two targets related to cancer metabolism: serine hydroxymethyltransferase and kidney glutaminase isoform C. Successful completion of the objectives of this proposal will positively impact public health by reducing the cost and time-to-market of developing new drugs, particularly with respect to novel protein targets. Project Narrative  Researchers will be able to more quickly and accurately identify potential drug candidates using the new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug discovery created by this project. These tools will be readily accessible through open-access web sites and open-source software. As part of the project these tools will be used to identify new molecules that are relevant to the treatment of cancer.","Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization",9634985,R01GM108340,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Glutaminase', 'Glutamine', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RANK protein', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'lead optimization', 'molecular shape', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'overexpression', 'pharmacophore', 'prospective', 'resource guides', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web interface', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,313000,0.03227973233936409
"Statistical framework for assessing drug sensitivity in vitro and linking patient outcomes Project Summary Pharmacogenomic studies offer insight into how genomic markers correlate with drug response and hold potential for developing effective personalized cancer treatment regimes. Cell viability dose-response curves are often summarized by the area-over-the-curve (AOC) and used to determine which cells are sensitive to a given treatment, thereby discovering markers of response. However, uncertainty surrounds pharmacogenomic findings for several reasons: 1) A lower-than-expected level of agreement between any two pharmacogenomic studies when comparing similarly-assayed cell lines and drugs, 2) how inter-study correlation is measured, 3) the sensitivity measure reported and subsequent threshold used to call sensitive versus resistant cell lines, and 4) how the in vitro models recapitulate in vivo patient outcomes. For the F-phase I develop a statistical model to address the first three of these issues and apply the model to cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) datasets to show that agreement is improved by conditioning on the posterior probability that a given drug is targeted and selecting the appropriate correlation metric for the underlying distribution of the data. I quantify uncertainty in calling sensitive versus resistant cell lines and report measures of inter-study agreement between other publicly-available pharmacogenomic datasets for common drugs and cell lines. I next provide findings from a collaborative effort assaying patient-derived organoids lines for individuals diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. I use my model to assess AOC and show through exploratory data analysis why the measure needs to be adjusted for growth rate confounding. I identify issues resulting from samples with low growth rates and motivate an empirical Bayes growth rate estimator. I show how the estimated growth rates compare with the other measures of sensitivity to illustrate the validity of the approach. I assess patient outcomes data with the organoid assays and report associations with patient time on treatment to motivate my second aim and the primary research direction for the K-phase of the fellowship. I show low correlations between the in vitro drug sensitivity measures and the in vivo patient sensitivity proxy measure. Given the low correlations I describe alternative measures of patient sensitivity and detail the first direction for my post-doctorate research. To that end I describe a deep learning model I am developing which takes as input clinical reports data and outputs cancer progression/response predictions. I use these labels to train a deep classifier which takes as input unstructured clinical notes and outputs a prediction of cancer progression along with an associated estimate of uncertainty. The input text is transformed into a vector embedding using word2vec and uncertainty is quantified via Bayes-by-backprop. Upon successful model training I will investigate using the predicted labels and uncertainty estimates to link to the pharmacogenomic in vitro sensitivity models to assess agreement between the models and patient outcomes. Project Narrative Pharmacogenomic studies offer insight into how genomic markers correlate with drug response and hold potential for developing effective personalized cancer treatment regimens, yet uncertainties surround their findings for several reasons. I develop a statistical modeling framework to quantify the posterior probability of sensitivity, study agreement, and associated uncertainty, then apply the model to pancreatic cancer-derived organoid lines. I illustrate confounding with cell growth rate, develop a shrinkage estimator for growth-rate normalized sensitivity measures, and lastly present associations between in vitro pharmacogenomic models and in vivo patient outcomes to motivate the need for both in vitro experiments and in silico methods which accurately recapitulate patient outcomes.",Statistical framework for assessing drug sensitivity in vitro and linking patient outcomes,9879060,F99CA245736,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Correlation Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease model', 'Dose', 'Drug Targeting', 'Encyclopedias', 'Fellowship', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Organoids', 'Output', 'Pancreas', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phase', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Probability', 'Proxy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'cell growth', 'conditioning', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'drug sensitivity', 'experimental study', 'genomic biomarker', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'off-label use', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'predicting response', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'statistics', 'treatment response', 'tumor progression', 'vector']",NCI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,F99,2019,32423,0.0006741959601520884
"Novel computational approaches for pharmacogenomic discovery PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Affordable high-throughput genome sequencing technologies had been expected to usher an era of precision medicine, whereby each patient receives an individualized treatment based on their genetic profile. However, precision medicine is yet to realize this potential and the number of clinically applied drug biomarkers lags far behind the number proposed in the scientific literature. Lack of reproducibility of proposed biomarkers has been highly problematic, and in particular the lack of effectiveness of biomarkers identified in pre-clinical studies when applied in clinical trial. In cancer, the number of drugs with FDA approved biomarkers remains at less than 30, and almost all of these arose because a drug was designed to target a specific known driver gene. Overall, only a handful of clinically actionable biomarkers have been discovered for drugs already in use. The objective of this project is to develop computational methods that will improve on existing biomarker discovery, and ultimately improve patient care and survival. My first aim is to develop an approach that will allow me to impute drug sensitivity in very large clinical datasets, such as TCGA. This imputed data will then be compared to measured markers in these data (e.g. somatic mutations) in order to identify novel predictors of drug response. The statistical models used to impute drug sensitivity will be developed in a pre-clinical disease model, where drug response has been accurately measured. In my second aim I will quantify the contribution of germline genetic variation to drug response in cancer. “Germline genetic variation” refers to the common genetic differences that exist between individuals, which are for the most part preserved in tumors. The contribution of this inter-individual genetic variation to variability in drug response between patients remains unquantified, although it is becoming clearer that it plays an important role. Finally, I will combine the information gathered in the first steps and build effective integrative models of drug response. Following the R00 phase (R01 and beyond), I envision that such models will be tested in patients; subsequently, measured drug response in these cohorts will be used to further refine future predictions. This will result in a framework where models actively improve their predictive performance as more data is gathered over time. To ensure the success of this project, I have assembled an expert mentorship team for the K99 phase, which includes a statistician, wet-lab biologists and clinicians, thus covering the entire scope of the precision medicine discovery and implementation pipeline. The University of Chicago, a world-class research institution, will provide the ideal environment and resources for such a cross-disciplinary, collaborative endeavor. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite enormous investment in precision medicine, most drug repurposing and biomarker discovery strategies have failed when applied in the clinic. This project will improve drug treatments by developing novel computational methods that will allow us to find new biomarkers and to better predict which patients will respond to what drugs, with application to cancer. The novel approach is based on integrating clinical sequencing and pre-clinical drug screening datasets.",Novel computational approaches for pharmacogenomic discovery,9836955,R00HG009679,"['Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Chicago', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Modelings', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Xenograft Model', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'cancer genome', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinical translation', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'cytotoxic', 'design', 'drug response prediction', 'drug sensitivity', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genetic profiling', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'response', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'success', 'targeted agent', 'theories', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,ST.

"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions. There is however, considerable interindividual variation in efficacy of statins for reducing disease risk, as well as in susceptibility to the most common adverse statin effects, myopathy and type 2 diabetes. The goal of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply complementary investigative approaches and multidisciplinary expertise for discovering and validating the genetic and metabolic factors responsible for this variability. This information has the potential for optimizig use of statins in clinical practice, and for identifying new pathways that underlie the diverse biologic actions of this drug class.              ",Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy,9772486,P50GM115318,"['Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Simvastatin', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker identification', 'blood glucose regulation', 'candidate validation', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'coronary event', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genotyped patients', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblast', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'side effect', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RES CTR AT OAKLAND,P50,2019,1524688,0.030219809588937847
"Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, having eclipsed motor vehicle-related deaths in 2008. A number of interventions have emerged in the last decade in response to this epidemic, including prescription drug monitoring programs; improving linkages to drug treatment; training drug users and those around them to recognize and respond appropriately to overdose; and, most recently, training and equipping law enforcement officers to use naloxone (an opioid antagonist) at the scene of an overdose. Equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone is intended to capitalize on the fact that officers often arrive at an overdose scene before other emergency services, particularly in rural areas, and until now have not been well equipped to deal with overdose events. In the last 5 years, with the active encouragement of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Department of Justice, law enforcement agencies in at least 28 states are planning to or have begun carrying naloxone to use when they attend overdoses. Despite the proliferation of such programs, this intervention is completely unstudied. In 2014 the San Diego Sheriff's Department began training patrol officers to use naloxone to respond to overdose prior to arrival of other emergency services, and to actively refer overdose victims to a collaborating drug treatment agency after revival. Uptake of drug treatment has been higher than expected (3 of 9 revivals in the 6 month pilot phase of the project entered treatment). We hypothesize that the moments after an overdose represent a ""teachable moment"" in which drug users may be more motivated to enter treatment. In addition, we hypothesize that having law enforcement officers respond to overdose as a medical emergency rather than as a crime scene may make drug users more willing to call 911 when someone overdoses. The overarching goal of this study is to determine the impact of law enforcement use of naloxone to respond to drug overdoses on two primary outcomes: (1) uptake of drug treatment referrals by overdose victims referred by law enforcement officers, and (2) rates of calling 911 to summon emergency medical services by drug users who witness overdoses. We will achieve these aims through a mixed methods study that includes secondary analysis of data available through our partnership with SDSD, their drug treatment partners the McAlister Institute, and the County of San Diego, including 911 dispatch data, SDSD case records, and treatment data. To complement these data we will conduct qualitative interviews with a community-recruited sample of drug users, to assess their perspectives around treatment referrals provided by SDSD Deputies, and their willingness to call 911 in the event of witnessed overdoses. Interviews and analysis will utilize methods drawn from grounded theory and ethnographic decision tree modeling (a rigorous qualitative method used to describe how individuals and organizations make decisions in given situations). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, with more people dying of overdose than in motor vehicles. One recent response to such deaths is equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone (an overdose antidote which can be sprayed into an overdose victim's nose), and training them to refer overdose victims to drug treatment once they are revived. This study will look at the use of naloxone by the San Diego Sheriff's Department, and will be the first research project in the world to investigate whether or not having law enforcement officers refer drug users to treatment immediately after an overdose is effective, and whether or not having law enforcement officers respond to an overdose as a medical emergency rather than a law enforcement issue makes drug users more likely to call 911 when someone overdoses.",Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health,9883361,R01DA040648,"['911 call', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Antidotes', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'County', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Drug Controls', 'Drug user', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnography', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Fatality rate', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Lawyers', 'Life', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Naloxone', 'Natural experiment', 'Nose', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Organizational Decision Making', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'base', 'design', 'empowered', 'first responder', 'health goals', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'peer', 'prescription monitoring program', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'rural area', 'secondary analysis', 'side effect', 'theories', 'uptake', 'willingness']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,135653,0.09057267786396811

"Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens ABSTRACT Patients with atrial fibrillation, post-acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism are prescribed antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet agents and oral anticoagulants) in dual and triple combinations. These drugs independently cause gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from mucosal defects or vascular abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiac patients are the fastest growing at-risk group due to the rapidly aging US population, their high-burden of co-morbidity, frequent antithrombotic polypharmacy and prescription of new antithrombotic drugs with higher incidence of GI adverse events. The real-world GIB risk of antithrombotic agents used in combination in a diverse cardiac population has yet to be characterized. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated poor performance of existing risk scores (HAS-BLED, CHA2DS2-VASC etc.) for the prediction of non- warfarin antithrombotic drug bleeding; scores frequently used in the clinical setting despite their inaccuracy. Absence of knowledge regarding the real-world risk of antithrombotic-GIB, and the inability to accurately predict which patients will bleed, hampers patient counselling regarding a frequently occurring adverse event which is known to cause morbidity and mortality among cardiac patients. We propose to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying GIB risk in a large, geographically diverse cohort of elderly and non-elderly cardiac patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism or post-acute coronary syndrome. GIB associated with antithrombotic drug combinations will be stratified by underlying cardiac conditions; incidence rates (events/100 patient-years) and propensity-matched Cox proportional models (with 95% confidence intervals) will be used to estimate outcome. We will examine heterogeneity of safety effects related to age, chronic co-morbidity, and hepatic or renal dysfunction. Machine learning techniques will then be used to derive and validate a highly sensitive algorithm for the prediction of antithrombotic-related GIB. Discovery of such an algorithm is the first step in the future application of a predictive model in any evidence-based clinical delivery platform, such as a decision rule or risk calculator. NARRATIVE Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in cardiac patients is common, deadly and on the rise due to an older population, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs used in combination, and availability of new drugs with higher GIB risk than their predecessors. Lack of data regarding the magnitude of GIB and limited knowledge of which patients are most at risk, prevents accurate counselling regarding cardiac drug safety. We will quantify this risk, study risk factors; and use machine learning techniques to derive and validate a clinical algorithm to better predict at-risk patients.",Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens,9692475,R01HS025402,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R01,2019,394737,0.025114962061565386
"Systems Pharmacological Analysis of Drug Efficacy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Project Summary/Abstract Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects more than 1 million Americans and has been increasing in prevalence in the last decade. IBD consists of two diseases, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which are both characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and can manifest with similar symptoms. Despite their similarities, the diseases are very heterogeneous and consist of complex interactions between the immune system, the microbiome, and the affected tissue. Characterizing the two diseases at the molecular level has been met with limited success, and the lack of a clear mechanistic pathway has resulted in the lack of efficacy of existing treatments in subsets of IBD patients. Previous methods have focused primarily on gene enrichment analysis, but these studies have shown inconsistent results and do not offer mechanistic insights into disease development. Systems pharmacological methods offer several advantages over traditional gene-based approaches by using networks to characterize relationships between genes, which enables the application of powerful analyses using graph theory. These methods enable us to use the topology of protein interaction networks to elucidate disease mechanisms and characterize network perturbations caused by drugs. Furthermore, with the advent of cheaper and more accurate modalities to quantify molecular profiles and the increasing availability of molecular data, we now have the ability to leverage multiple data sources to create a multifaceted approach to understanding the mechanism of IBD. Thus, by combining protein-protein interaction data, drug target data, and drug perturbation data, we aim to (1) construct personalized molecular networks for UC and CD, (2) develop a supervised network method to model drug effects, and (3) identify and validate novel drugs for treatment responders and nonresponders. With success, we will have the ability to distinguish treatment responders from nonresponders and have identified potential novel drug candidates to treat IBD. Furthermore, we will have a more thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of IBD, which will enable the development of more effective therapies to alleviate the suffering of millions worldwide. Project Narrative Inflammatory bowel disease affects over a million people in the United States, and many affected patients do not respond to current therapies. This proposal addresses this challenge by developing methods to discern patients unlikely to respond to these therapies and identifying novel therapeutic agents for drug responders and drug nonresponders.

"Genetic analysis of endocannabinoid signaling in C. elegans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) – comprising the endocannabinoids, their G-protein coupled re- ceptors, and their metabolic enzymes – is one of the most important physiological systems involved in estab- lishing and maintaining human health. In some illnesses, ECS dysregulation is an element of disease pathol- ogy whereas in others it is believed to be protective. Thus, there is intense interest in developing pharma- cotherapies that target the ECS to blunt its pathologies or harness its protective effects. One of the main challenges in developing new drugs that target the ECS is the problem of side effects, con- sistent with the nearly ubiquitous expression of this signaling system. Current efforts to increase the functional specificity of ECS drugs include preventing them from crossing the blood brain barrier, and targeting ancillary ECS proteins which modulate principal ECS components without being direct effectors themselves. Until now, discovery of ancillary proteins has proceeded mainly by inference from prior knowledge obtained from isolated cells. This approach can be limiting because knowledge of the underlying genetic and biochemical networks is usually incomplete. Here we propose to develop new high-throughput methodologies to enable the first unbi- ased genetic screens to identify new ECS molecules in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans is an omnivorous bacterivore but it learns to prefer some species of bacteria more than others. We recently discovered that one of the worm's endocannabinoids increases the worm’s appetite for favored foods over less favored foods, a phenomenon called hedonic amplification. We propose this system as a genetically tractable model of cannabinoid effects on appetitive behavior, providing an easily screenable phenotype that directly corresponds to a well-known human behavior. The research develops two high-throughput microfluidic systems for quantifying hedonic amplification in C. ele- gans. The systems are then utilized to perform two small-scale genetic screens as a prelude to future large- scale screens. In the first, hedonic amplification will be quantified in strains in which homologs of known mam- malian ECS components have been knocked out; this screen further validates the C. elegans ECS as a mam- malian model. In the second screen, hedonic amplification will be assessed in a select set of wild isolate strains of C. elegans to estimate the heritability of this phenotype. The research is significant because it could ultimately lead to the discovery of novel drug targets to mitigate disease and promote health. Cell-to-cell signaling mechanisms involving endocannabinoids are involved in numerous physiological and psy- chological conditions including nausea, obesity, pain, anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and neu- rodegenerative disease where they can be part of the disease or the body's protective response to it. However, most attempts to harness the therapeutic potential of endocannabinoid signaling have been stymied by prob- lematic side effects. The proposed research develops and applies innovative methods to screen for genes en- coding new members of the endocannabinoid signaling system as potential drug targets for treatment of endo- cannabinoid-related diseases, with fewer and milder side effects.",Genetic analysis of endocannabinoid signaling in C. elegans,9650393,R21DA047645,"['Action Potentials', 'Anxiety', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cells', 'Chemotaxis', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Enzymes', 'Fire - disasters', 'Food', 'Food Preferences', 'Future', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heart', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Ingestion', 'Invertebrates', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Muscle', 'Mutagenesis', 'Names', 'Nausea', 'Nematoda', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Obesity', 'Operating System', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Organ', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Pump', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'anandamide', 'base', 'cell type', 'design', 'endocannabinoid signaling', 'endogenous cannabinoid system', 'feeding', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic strain', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'hedonic', 'innovation', 'interest', 'loss of function mutation', 'marijuana use disorder', 'member', 'mutant', 'neural circuit', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'preference', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'trait']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2019,220842,0.0009841065206781768
"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Project Summary The growing importance of artificial intelligence (AI) is visible by the growth in companies and increasing deals over the past year between pharma and smaller companies using machine learning to assist in drug discovery. The continuing steady growth of structure-activity data for diverse targets, diseases and molecular properties poses a considerable challenge as they are generally not readily accessible for machine learning: content resides in a mixture of public databases (with differing levels of curation), disparate files within research groups, non- curated literature publications. In Phase I, Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. developed a prototype of Assay Central software and used this with a wide variety of structure activity data from sources both public and private, formatted and unformatted, for enabling neglected, rare or common disease targets. Public data was mixed with collaborator/customer-contributed data, using original software and applied chemistry judgment of an expert team. In Phase I we created error checking and correction software. We also built and validated Bayesian models with the datasets that were collected and cleaned. And, in addition, we developed new data visualization tools. The software environment that we created readily enables the user to compile structure-activity data for building computational models and can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators as needed. This software can in turn be used for scoring new molecules and visualizing the multiple outputs in various formats. We have enabled ~14 collaborative projects which have shared models on specific targets such as PyrG for Tuberculosis (identifying a lead compound), HIV reverse transcriptase, whole cell screening for Leishmaniasis as well as P450 and nuclear receptor models (e.g. estrogen receptor) relevant to toxicology. We have utilized Assay Central in our ongoing internal projects working on Ebola, HIV and tuberculosis small molecule drug discovery. In Phase II, we propose the following aims that will enable us to develop Assay Central into a production tool for enabling drug discovery collaborations which we will continue to focus on. In Phase 1 we performed a preliminary analysis of different machine learning algorithms with select drug discovery datasets. In Phase II we will now perform a thorough evaluation and selection of additional machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors as well as assessment of combination of algorithms (e.g. Bayesian and Deep Learning). We will implement disease/target definitions for machine learning models to facilitate drug discovery. We will enable molecule selection and automated design and optimization. The utility of having such a tool as Assay Central readily available will empower scientists to leverage public, private or a combination of data to help with their drug discovery tasks. Developing this software suite of computational models with public data will enable us to identify foundations, academics and potential collaborators that generate preliminary data to test models. These efforts will dramatically increase the number of projects we can work on, create new IP, and generate employment using machine learning focused on drug discovery in the area of rare and neglected diseases, in particular. Assay Central benefits include 1. Ease of deployment and use with a Java file executed by users without the need for IT support; 2. Built on industry standard technologies; 3. Graphical display of models provides instant feedback; 4 Model applicability with multiple methods to assess scores and graphics. Project Narrative In Phase I Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. have developed a prototype of ‘Assay Central’ software and used this with a wide variety of structure activity data from sources both public and private, formatted and unformatted, for enabling neglected, rare or common disease targets. The software environment that we created readily enables us to compile structure-activity data for building computational models, can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators and has been used successfully to find promising lead compounds for many collaborators. We now propose in Phase II to optimize the underlying machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors (e.g. combining Bayesian and Deep Learning), linking potentially thousands of rare and neglected diseases to the machine learning models, and automating molecule selection and new molecule design to enable further high value drug discovery collaborations with Assay Central.",Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations,9619615,R44GM122196,"['Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Client', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ebola virus', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Fees', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Industry Standard', 'Intention', 'Java', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leishmaniasis', 'Licensing', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training Support', 'Triage', 'Tuberculosis', 'Update', 'Vendor', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data submission', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'exhaustion', 'forest', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'neglect', 'novel therapeutics', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'scale up', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trend']",NIGMS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R44,2018,694172,0.030698928986487222
"Meta-Analysis and Machine Learning: Towards Neuromarkers of Craving and Relapse Abstract The experience of drug craving is known to increase drug use1-6 and relapse after treatment7-16. Specifically, drug-related stimuli are known to elicit cue-induced craving, as well as physiological and neural responses, called cue reactivity, which have all been directly linked to drug use and relapse across addictions17-35, including gambling36-39. To date, hundreds of studies investigated neural cue-reactivity; however, there is little consensus in findings, due to significant variation in methods, drug types, cue types, and analysis procedures. Further, prior meta-analyses used suboptimal methods and inclusion criteria, and were underpowered40-44. In Aim 1, we propose to use state-of-the-art meta-analytic methods45-47 to summarize findings from ~120 published imaging studies, representing >3000 participants during neural cue reactivity/cue- induced craving (and 3x larger than any prior meta-analysis). Following our prior meta-analytic work in other domains48-61, we will use optimized inclusion criteria and correction methods, and account for multiple methodological differences in studies across substances (e.g., cigarettes, alcohol, cocaine, cannabis) and gambling, a behavioral addiction. Further, we will test for differences across drug types (e.g., cigarettes vs. alcohol) and different cue-types (e.g., pictures vs. video) to resolve several open questions in the field (e.g., role of insula in cigarette craving vs. drug craving in general62, 63; pre-scan abstinence64, 65). In Aim 2, we will go beyond meta-analysis to address an urgent need in addiction research66: development of predictive biomarkers67-69, which are stable indicators of biological processes. Biomarkers have been developed in other areas of medicine70, and we have recently done this in pain71, negative emotion72-74, and empathy74. To do this, we will combine the meta-analytic results obtained in Aim 1 with person-level fMRI data from our lab (of cue-induced craving75-79) using machine learning models, to establish a multivariate pattern of neural activity that can predict craving self-report from neural activity – a predictive neuromarker for craving. Given the associations between neural cue reactivity, craving, and drug use outcome, a multivariate neuromarker could provide a powerful neural predictor of outcomes66, 67. Thus, in Aim 3, we will validate this neuromarker on data from two ongoing clinical trials of N=128 cigarette smokers and N=150 cocaine users collected at Yale's Psychotherapy Development Center (P50 DA09241; Center PI: Carroll; Project PI: Kober). Here, the neuromarker will be used on pre-treatment fMRI cue-reactivity data to predict both self-reported craving and long-term clinical outcomes (e.g., cocaine abstinence). The validated neuromarker will provide well-defined brain targets that can then be used to test the efficacy of interventions to reduce craving and drug use, such as pharmacotherapies, brain stimulation, or cognitive training, and to monitor patient progress in both research and clinical settings. ! Project Narrative Among substance users, exposure to drug cues is associated with neural cue reactivity and cue-induced craving, both of which are directly linked to addiction severity and relapse after treatment. We will employ state-of-the-art statistical and computational methods to establish a consistent neural pattern associated with cue reactivity and cue-induced craving. Then we will validate it using recently-collected imaging data – moving towards a predictive biomarker of drug craving, which can be used to investigate brain processes related to treatment efficacy and drug use outcomes in research as well as clinical settings.",Meta-Analysis and Machine Learning: Towards Neuromarkers of Craving and Relapse,9489234,R01DA043690,"['Abstinence', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cannabis', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Users', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Cues', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug usage', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gambling', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychotherapy', 'Publishing', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'cognitive training', 'craving', 'cue reactivity', 'density', 'design', 'drug craving', 'drug relapse', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'movie', 'neural correlate', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'smoking cue', 'success']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,430771,0.047574872683283
"Commercialization of a Software Platform to Increase the Efficiency of Human Clinical Trials using Patient-Level Machine Learning Models ABSTRACT Neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are characterized by heterogeneous disease progression. As a group, these complex diseases are influenced by an interplay between several genetic and environmental factors. Drug development for these diseases could benefit from a framework that selects more homogeneous participants for inclusion in clinical trials, but current methods have largely failed in this regard. In ALS, both slowly and rapidly progressing patients have been identified as confounding statistical analyses of clinical trials. Statistically speaking, heterogeneous disease progression rates in ALS clinical trials contribute to both trial arm misbalances and high variances of study populations. These issues increase the size, duration and cost of clinical trials in neurological diseases and contribute to high failure rates. In our successful phase 1 SBIR grant, we used ALS as a model disease to develop our neurological disease product prototype based on machine learning disease progression models that improves trial arm randomization and stratifies participants according to disease progression. We worked with a clinical trialist to develop a user interface capable of returning a randomization group assignment in real-time. Our ForecastOne® Trials prototype product has passed IRB review and will be used in a 12-site clinical trial starting in fall, 2017. The objectives of this phase 2 SBIR are to convert the ALS neurological product prototype into a commercializable, robust, scalable, market-ready product with a versatile API and to develop a pipeline of models and applications that will expand our product offerings of drug development and clinical trial optimization tools for additional neurodegenerative indications. Aim 1: Construct a robust, scalable platform infrastructure for the neurological product based on a central  Application Programming Interface (API) that receives user input and returns actionable information in real-time.  The prototype ForecastOne® Trials tool will be developed into a robust, scalable 21 CFR part 11 compliant product  using ALS as a first indication that allows the rapid deployment of additional applications and disease indications. Aim 2: Develop a pipeline of neurodegenerative models and applications to populate the neurological product. We  will add additional disease indications to the product created in Aim 1, including AD, PD and HD. The suite of marketable products that we create following this phase 2 grant will answer drug development needs of a full portfolio of neurodegenerative diseases. Ultimately, we see a series of machine learning models and applications aimed at solving drug development issues for multiple disease areas, including oncology, cardiology, infectious diseases, metabolic disorders, autoimmune diseases and respiratory diseases, etc. These models and applications will vastly increase the speed and efficiency of drug development, resulting in faster, cheaper, more efficient drug trials that yield numerous new medications to ease human pain and suffering. NARRATIVE This work builds on ForecastOne® Trials, a prototype drug development tool created during our successful phase 1 SBIR grant using machine-learning generated predictions of patient disease progression.

"Functional regression framework with applications to drug response prediction Drug sensitivity prediction for individual patients is a significant challenge for precision medicine. Current modeling approaches consider prediction of a single feature of the drug response curve such as Area Under the Curve or IC50. However, the single feature summary of the dose response curve does not provide the entire drug sensitivity profile as some features vary systematically with cell lines while others with drugs. The overall goal of this proposal is to design a mathematical and computational framework for dose response curve prediction based on target response curves and genetic characterizations. For individual patients, the problem is formulated as functional prediction from functional predictors. The functional predictors refer to the dose response of specific targets inhibited by the drug that can be obtained from chemical databases and drug kinase activity studies. To achieve our goal, we propose three specific aims: In Aim 1, we will design a Bayesian framework for estimating the significant drivers of a disease along with the design of a model for single and combination drug response prediction. In Aim 2, we will enhance the model by incorporating non-functional predictors in the form of genetic characterizations and develop a joint model to predict dose response curves with both genetic characteristics as well as target response curves as inputs. We propose to develop an efficient way of searching such extremely high dimensional predictor space. In Aim 3, we will develop a hybrid prediction mechanism that combines inferentially motivated model-based techniques and computationally efficient machine learning techniques to improve predictions as well as obtain significant predictors simultaneously. The proposed framework is appropriate for modeling and analyzing cellular response to single or combination of perturbation agents and the successful completion of the aims will allow us to design personalized therapy along with increased understanding of functional response of cells to external perturbations. The proposal considers the design of a novel framework for drug response curve prediction based on drug target profiles and genetic characterizations. The successful implementation of the innovation will have broad societal benefit as it involves facilitating precision medicine with the objective of improved outcomes.",Functional regression framework with applications to drug response prediction,9533661,R01GM122084,"['Area Under Curve', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Modeling', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Techniques', 'base', 'computer framework', 'design', 'drug response prediction', 'drug sensitivity', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'response']",NIGMS,TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,213915,0.06268484918916983
"Development of a metabolomics and machine learning based high-throughput screening platform for data-driven drug discovery Project Summary High-throughput omics technologies allow for measuring various biomolecules comprehensively and over the past decade have become exponentially less expensive. Coupling these developing emerging technologies with automation approaches and the phenotypic-based drug discovery paradigm allows for “data-driven” drug discovery (D4). D4 focuses on a complete cellular readout, quantitatively measuring 100s to 100,000s of biomolecules, rather than focusing on a single protein, pathway, or physiological trait. The complexity of this data requires computational tools for proper analysis and interpretation. A pioneering project and dataset for D4 is the Broad Institute’s Connectivity Map, which is a transcriptomics screening and query platform for drug characterization, discovery, and repositioning. Though with many successes, the Connectivity Map is based on only a single biomolecule type, RNA, and downstream effects caused by chemical perturbations to proteins and metabolites are ignored. In this proposal, we combine the dual strengths of experts in LC-MS/MS based metabolomics (Omix Technologies) with leaders in metabolic network modeling and metabolomics data analysis (Sinopia Biosciences) to develop a metabolomics based high-throughput compound screening platform. Our preliminary data for two major drugs (doxorubicin and rapamycin) showcases that our approach has technical validity, accuracy, and provides potential biological utility that complements transcriptomics based approaches. This Phase I proposal will assess the biological utility of a metabolomics-based screening platform. First, we will profile ~250 FDA approved small molecules from a broad range of drug classes. Second, we will develop the necessary bioinformatics pipelines, mechanistic metabolic models, and machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret these complex datasets. Finally, we will assess whether adding metabolomics data to the Connectivity Map boosts D4 predictions including assessing compound mechanisms of actions, compound similarity, identifying biomarkers for drug efficacy and safety, and identifying drug repurposing opportunities. After the biological utility of this approach is demonstrated in Phase I, Phase II will focus on profiling of novel chemical and genetic perturbations to further demonstrate the power of the platform and identify commercial opportunities for treating rare genetic diseases. Project Narrative Data-driven drug discovery provides the potential to accelerate drug development timelines, decrease costs, and ultimately provide better care to patients. Combining Sinopia Bioscience’s and Omix Technologies strengths in high-throughput data generation and analysis, we will build a unique platform focused on the impact of human metabolism in disease. This proposal will test the viability of this approach and focus on several rare genetic diseases with significant unmet needs.",Development of a metabolomics and machine learning based high-throughput screening platform for data-driven drug discovery,9621965,R43GM130268,"['Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Automation', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Cancer cell line', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doxorubicin', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Expression Profiling', 'FDA approved', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Luminescent Proteins', 'MCF7 cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmaceutical Services', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Sirolimus', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'base', 'cell growth', 'chemical genetics', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'metabolomics', 'molecular phenotype', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein metabolite', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,"SINOPIA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R43,2018,442427,0.07415519428223953
"Biocomputation across distributed private datasets to enhance drug discovery Project Summary Collaborative Drug Discovery (CDD) proposes to develop technology that will vastly simplify and integrate all the processes required to exploit predictive models for drug discovery. The software will make it easy for scientists without specialized training in informatics to create, train, apply, evaluate, share, and archive models with minimal effort, and also leverage a large library of pre-computed models with zero effort. The software will also enable scientists working in different organizations to collectively build models from their aggregated data and share these models, without sharing the underlying training data.  Our goal is to democratize the role in drug discovery of computational models – which have historically been restricted to computational experts – and allow models to become routine aids to the discovery workflow in academia, foundations, government laboratories, and small companies that do not have the resources to employ them today. In Phase 2 we implemented modified Bayesian model building directly within CDD’s web- based CDD Vault platform, which securely hosts structure-activity relationship (SAR) data; any user can now easily train a Bayesian model with experimental data stored in her private Vault, then apply the model to predict activity for untested compounds. In Phase 2B we propose to generalize this capability with the following new Specific Aims, which are needed to achieve a widespread scientific and commercial impact: Aim 1: Integrate a suite of diverse computational techniques (such as QSAR, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, and possibly others) into a single framework, to allow direct side-by-side comparison. Aim 2: Develop and validate a universal metric that ranks the predictive strength of each method as applied to a particular dataset. Aim 3: Apply the metric to automatically generate thousands of models from high-quality, public-access structure-activity and ADME/Tox datasets and present key results to the user. Aim 4: Develop a novel capability to build models collaboratively, by aggregating multiple datasets, and share the models without revealing the compounds and data in the training sets. Project Narrative The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to accelerate the discovery of new and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. These tools will particularly benefit researchers working on diseases that leading pharmaceutical companies have largely ignored because they are not perceived as highly profitable opportunities, despite the fact that in many cases they afflict millions of people.",Biocomputation across distributed private datasets to enhance drug discovery,9460583,R44TR000942,"['Academia', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Update', 'biocomputing', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'forest', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'model building', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2018,749018,0.04842976366917423
"Rules for penetrating the Gram-negative bacterial envelope The development of new antimicrobials has drastically lagged behind the fast growth of drug resistant pathogenic microbes, especially for Gram-negative (GN) bacteria. To be effective in GN bacteria, entering and staying in the cells is a challenge. Insight into the physicochemical properties that enable the entrance of compounds is critical to direct future effort in the development of effective treatment against GN pathogens. Toward this goal, we will develop methods to accurately quantify the accumulation of small molecule compounds, without requiring fluorescence or other properties for detection, and independent of their antibacterial activity. In addition, we will develop a novel computational algorithm to describe and predict physicochemical properties that favors entry and evade efflux in GN bacteria. The computer model will be validated and refined through the selection and characterization of ~1,500 of compounds. Specifically, we will pursue the following aims: Aim 1) To develop and validate LC-MS/MS based assays to quantify compound partition. We will use a panel of antibiotics as ""gold standards"" to develop and validate assays to accurately determine the accumulation of small molecule compounds in different cellular compartments. We will develop LC-MS/MS assays and experiment with the kinetics of entrance, optimizing the conditions to enable reproducible and accurate quantification. We will use a CRE strain of E. coli and a MDR strain of Acinetobacter baumannii in this study. Aim 2) To develop a computational algorithm for predicting compounds that are potentially good penetrators for GN bacteria. We will develop a new and highly accurate computational algorithm through machine learning which can systematically recognize all favorable structural factors of the compounds effective for GN bacteria. Selected compounds will be experimentally characterized in Aim 3, the knowledge from which will be incorporated back into refining the computational algorithm to generate a new round of learning/prediction. This cycle will be repeated, with the testing of ~1,500 compounds in total. Aim 3) To measure the accumulation and subcellular distribution of selected compounds and to validate rules on compound accumulation. With the assays from Aim 1, we will measure the accumulation data of compounds selected through Aim 2. Data from these analyses will be used to polish the computer model in Aim 2. Finally, the models will be evaluated through measurement of accumulation data of selected compounds and examine if the experimental data match the prediction. The knowledge gap about penetrating the cellular envelope has become the biggest hurdle to the rational design of new classes of antimicrobials against all GN pathogens. Outcome from the proposed study will help bridge the gap between a potent inhibitor and an effective antibacterial drug. The combined use of the detailed experimental assays and the new computational algorithm will empower drug discovery efforts that aim to identify promising drug candidates targeting GN bacteria. The development of new antimicrobials has drastically lagged behind the fast growth of drug resistant pathogenic microbes, especially for Gram-negative (GN) bacteria. Insight into the physicochemical properties that enable the entrance of compounds is critical to direct future effort in the development of effective treatment against GN pathogens.

"Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a novel approach based on deep learning neural networks to encode molecules into chemically rich vectors. We will first apply this representation to build more powerful computational models that can more accurately predict properties such as bioactivity, ADME/ Tox, and pharmacokinetics across libraries of molecular structures. The ultimate goal is to leverage this repre- sentation to generate novel compounds with better combinations of properties. Both of these capabilities will help scientists to accelerate discovery of new drugs broadly across many therapeutic areas.  Scientists engaged in drug discovery research from academic laboratories to large pharmaceutical companies rely on computational QSAR models to predict pharmacologically relevant properties and obviate the need to perform expensive, time-consuming assays (many of which require animal studies) for every molecule of interest. Some properties (e.g. logP) can now be modeled with such high confidence that the models have replaced the need to perform the assays, but many other critical properties (e.g. solubility, ADME, PK, hERG) remain far from this goal. We expect that our proposed chemically rich vectors will significantly advance the state of the art beyond what can be achieved with conventional descriptors and fingerprints. Improved models will enable researchers to select lead candidate series more effectively, explore chemical space around leads to generate novel IP more efficiently, reduce failure rates for compounds advancing through the drug discovery pipeline, and accelerate the entire drug discovery process. These benefits will be realized broadly across most therapeutic areas.  Our central innovation is a novel computational strategy: first develop a deep learning (DL) model optimized to best capture the essential structural and chemical features of molecules, starting from the most natural structural representation; then validate the DL model by applying it to improve QSAR modeling of pharmacological properties; and finally extend it to generate previously unknown molecules that have superior properties – the so-called “inverse QSAR” problem, which is the Holy Grail of computational medicinal chemistry. Others have unsuccessfully tried to leap directly to solve the inverse QSAR problem. We propose a more patient and methodical approach that will allow the neural network to perform self-supervised training to learn about chemical structures and properties from readily available, extremely large datasets, then transfer this learning to improve modeling; only after establishing this solid foundation do we intend to apply the models to attempt inverse QSAR. Prior attempts in this area have also relied on neural network architectures designed originally for language processing. We will design a new architecture, more akin to neural network architectures that have proven most successful at image classification, and optimize it to directly process the “molecular graph” that represents the relationship of atoms and bonds in molecules. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to understand whether potential new drugs are likely to be both safe and effective, and identify similar compounds that are likely to be safer and more effective against the same target. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. !",Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts,9612249,R43TR002527,"['Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Bank', 'Molecular Structure', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Solid', 'Solubility', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'computational chemistry', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lead candidate', 'lead series', 'learning strategy', 'molecular vector', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'vector', 'voice recognition']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R43,2018,149830,0.027815302904164115
"A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis PROJECT SUMMARY This project will address the critical need for new and effective antitubercular drugs. Our primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis tolerates antitubercular drug treatment. Our motivating hypothesis is that M. tuberculosis tolerates drug induced stress by differentially regulating detoxification enzymes, efflux pumps, metabolic activity, pellicle-forming factors, and cell wall remodeling systems. Further, we postulate that a secondary drug targeting one or few regulators of these tolerance strategies will potentiate the primary drug-treatment, and potentially reduce the emergence of resistance. We propose a systems biology approach to generate a network perspective of drug-induced tolerance mechanisms and how they are coordinated by one or few regulators that could be targeted for overcoming drug-specific tolerance using combinatorial treatment regimens. Hence, the innovation of our proposed research emerges from integrating network characterization of drug- specific tolerance mechanisms into the rational discovery of novel drug combinations. In Aim 1, we will transcriptionally profile M. tuberculosis following treatment with ten selected drugs (primary drugs). Using techniques developed in our laboratory, differentially expressed genes will be mapped onto a systems-scale gene regulatory network model of M. tuberculosis to infer drug-specific tolerance sub-networks and elucidate key regulators. We will also identify tolerance sub-networks by generating genome-wide fitness profiles in the presence of the selected primary drugs. Drug-associated fitness defects will reveal genes that are important for dealing with drug-induced stress and are hypothesized to cluster together in drug-specific tolerance sub-networks. In Aim 2, we will transcriptionally profile ~250 secondary drugs and perform combination high-throughput screens of all primary and secondary drug combinations. Data from these studies will be used to iteratively refine the model and develop a machine learning algorithm to identify gene- and network-level features that are predictive of synergistic drug interactions. Finally, mechanism of synergistic drug combinations will be characterized by selectively perturbing the predicted regulators of the tolerance sub-networks. This project will propel the development of systems biology tools to accurately predict novel synergistic drug combinations, thereby guiding experimental assessment and accelerating the delivery of new treatments to patients with tuberculosis infection. PROJECT NARRATIVE Treatment of tuberculosis infection (responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually) is complicated by the impermeable cell wall structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its intrinsic ability to adapt and withstand drug treatment, a phenomenon called tolerance. Thus, an urgent goal of antitubercular drug discovery is to overcome drug tolerance. This project will deepen our understanding of how M. tuberculosis responds to and thereby tolerates drug treatment and will use this systems-scale understanding to develop a predictive framework for identifying new synergistically acting drug combinations for the treatment of tuberculosis.",A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9392522,R01AI128215,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antitubercular Agents', 'Cell Wall', 'Cessation of life', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Enzymes', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'combinatorial', 'differential expression', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'fitness', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'response', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2018,912707,0.14216128145974083
"Developing a novel platform for rapid identification of drug targets and anti-targets PROJECT SUMMARY Drugs act by altering the activities of particular components (targets) within a cell or organism. Thus, drug discovery campaigns begin by identifying a target, followed by screening this target with compounds to identify leads that can be developed into a drug. Unfortunately, identifying effective drug targets for a given disease, let alone for individual patients (e.g. in highly heterogeneous cancers) is an expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone process. As a result, drugs are frequently developed against incorrect or suboptimal targets, and end up showing no clinical efficacy. Powerful genomic technologies have paved the way for much of the modern understanding of molecular biology, but they have not proven efficient at identifying drug targets. Phenotypic screening, which identifies efficacious drugs by screening compounds directly on cells, has thus regained popularity. In phenotypic screening, however, the targets are typically unknown. We are developing an innovative biotechnology platform that directly identifies effective pharmacological targets from cellular disease models by combining the two approaches, target- based and phenotypic-based screening. This is accomplished with the use of a highly annotated chemical library and sophisticated machine learning algorithms. The compounds are screened in a cell-based assay, and the phenotypic readouts are analyzed in relation to the compounds’ biochemical activities, revealing the candidate targets that are mediating the therapeutic activity of effective compounds. This approach can one day be applied at the patient level, for example using patient-derived cancer cells. We have focused our proof of concept studies on the kinase family of drug targets, and hypothesize that our platform can identify kinase dependencies in cancer cells that cannot otherwise be identified using transcriptomic and whole exome sequencing data. The aims of this Phase I application are to 1) deploy our platform to identify novel kinase targets in DLBCL Lymphoma, and 2) identify kinase inhibitors that could be used to build a compound library that optimizes the performance of the platform. Innovative features of the platform include the combination of target- and phenotypic-based screening, the machine learning algorithm that efficiently detects targets as well as anti-targets, the cell-based screening strategy which uses both tumor and normal cells to detect cancer-specific cytotoxicity, and the unique design features of the compound library. The platform will enable rapid target identification in any area of disease where a clinically relevant cell-based model exists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past two decades, the cost of developing new drugs has skyrocketed. A major culprit is the difficulty in identifying cellular components that can be engaged by drugs to produce a therapeutic effect. This proposal has two main aims: 1) The first aim is to demonstrate that by using computer algorithms to combine biochemical- and cellular- screening data, effective drug targets can be identified for two different subtypes of DLBCL lymphoma. Importantly, the method also identifies off-targets that, if disturbed, will counteract the desired outcome (i.e. lower or neutralize a drug’s efficacy). The method uses normal blood cells from healthy donors to ensure that the identified drug targets serve to specifically abolish cancer cells without harming normal cells. These key features make our method a valuable complement for currently used target identification technologies, including genomics and proteomics. 2) The second aim is to develop the core components of the methodology into a robust and standalone platform that can be used by drug discovery programs at Truvitech, its partners, and its clients. !",Developing a novel platform for rapid identification of drug targets and anti-targets,9553172,R41TR002293,"['Adult Lymphoma', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood Cells', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Client', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Complication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Biology', 'Normal Cell', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Promega', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'RNA Interference', 'Research', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cellular targeting', 'central nervous system injury', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic manipulation', 'genomic platform', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'kinase inhibitor', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'lead optimization', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'research and development', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NCATS,"TRUVITECH, LLC",R41,2018,224804,0.07395772757843193
"Mechanisms linking neighborhood poverty to problematic adolescent drug use PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Where a child grows up can inﬂuence his or her risk of problematic drug use. Surprisingly, policies and programs designed to improve neighborhood conditions have yielded conﬂicting results in which some children beneﬁt but others are harmed. Understanding the mechanisms by which neighborhoods act to affect problem- atic drug use and how these mechanisms differ across subgroups and cities—that is, understanding where and for whom mechanisms apply—is essential to optimize the effectiveness of future neighborhood interventions. Mechanisms involving mediation by aspects of the school environment have been unexamined, but could prove promising for understanding differential effects of neighborhood on problematic drug use. The objective of this K99/R00 is to identify school-based mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use and to develop statistical methods to understand how mediation effects differ across subgroup and place. This objective contributes to the long-term goal of improving the effectiveness of interven- tions to prevent drug abuse and dependence by tailoring interventions to address the most relevant mechanisms of action for each target population based on place and individual-level characteristics. The K99 phase ﬁlls the following training gaps that are critical to achieving the research objective and long-term goal: 1) methodologic training in causal mediation analysis; 2) subject-matter training in drug abuse and dependence prevention in ur- ban populations; and 3) involvement in real-world school-based interventions to develop methods with practical utility. Aim 1 of the proposed research identiﬁes the school environment mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and adolescent problematic drug use and modiﬁers of those mechanisms. Aim 2 extends a statistical method recently developed by the proposed research team for generalizing intervention ef- fects from one city to another to generalizing mediation effects. Finally, Aim 3 uses the method developed in Aim 2 to identify how the school environment mechanisms mediating neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use differ across major U.S. cities. The proposed research is expected to identify school-based mechanisms underly- ing differential effects of neighborhood poverty on adolescent problematic drug use by subgroup and place using the only study of randomized neighborhood residence. In addition, it is expected to contribute a novel statistical method that incorporates cutting-edge machine learning techniques to identify which mediation mechanisms can generalize across place, advancing translational research. Successful interventions are assumed to work in differ- ent settings, but that is not the case in practice. The proposed research will allow us to predict intervention effects while accounting for differences in population composition and modiﬁers of the mediation mechanism. This will make a signiﬁcant contribution to improving health by informing the design and targeting of future neighborhood interventions to adolescents and places that may be most impacted in terms of problematic drug use prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is to expected to advance understanding of how two important contexts—neighborhood and school—act together to inﬂuence problematic drug use among adolescents, including how these mechanisms differ across adolescent subgroups and places. In addition, the proposed research will result in the development of a ﬂexible statistical method to predict intervention mechanism effects in new target populations, taking into account population composition. Together, these contributions are anticipated to optimize targeting of future interventions to prevent drug abuse and addiction.",Mechanisms linking neighborhood poverty to problematic adolescent drug use,9589463,R00DA042127,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Development', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home visitation', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Schools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tweens', 'Work', 'adolescent drug use', 'base', 'boys', 'bullying', 'career', 'design', 'drug abuse prevention', 'flexibility', 'girls', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'method development', 'novel', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'residence', 'societal costs', 'successful intervention']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R00,2018,247384,0.04507962692241187
"A knowledge map to find Alzheimer's disease drugs To stem the rising incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in our aging population, new methods to repurpose and combine drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) are acutely required. This is a challenge, however, because the complex polygenic basis of AD remains opaque, and rational methods to repurpose drugs are in early years, even for well-defined gene targets. To address these problems, we propose new algorithms to integrate data on a very large scale so as to combine evolutionary information and high-throughput experimental observations with the knowledge conveyed by text in the literature. First, to detect disease-relevant genome variations in AD patients, Aim 1 will combine a novel mathematical calculus of mutational landscapes with machine learning, in so doing suggesting primary candidate genes for drug targeting based on signs of mutational selection in cases or controls. Next, to repurpose and combine drugs targeting these genes, Aim 2 will map a large fraction of all that is known about genes, phenotypes, and drugs into a single high-dimensional network that represents their interactions as described in various databases (structured data) and in the literature (unstructured data). The topology of this network will determine the optimal choice of single drug or combination therapy in an approach that can be personalized. Finally, to validate efficacy experimentally, Aim 3 will test both our candidate genes and drugs with state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo screens. Feasibility rests with prior studies on evolution, networks, systems, and text-mining that demonstrate accurate predictions of deleterious mutations and their clinical sequelae and the discovery of drivers of diseases. Broadly, this work will yield proof of principle for a novel quantitative model that integrates fundamental concepts from mathematics and molecular evolution, and for a low resolution but large-scale map of biomedical knowledge in which network notions of distance computed by machine learning identify relevant functional hypothesis that would otherwise be easily overlooked. The result will be a new experimental ability to unravel the genotype-phenotype relationship in Alzheimer's Disease so as to guide drug therapy. Alzheimer's is a devastating disease projected to rise dramatically in our aging population. To develop drugs against it, we propose to train machine learning on the DNA of patients with Alzheimer's to detect genes with abnormal mathematical features in their mutations. Then, we will place these genes in a “map”, which represents a large fraction of biomedical knowledge in a high-dimensional network. The drugs that fall near our genes of interest in this map are our candidates, and experiments will test in cell and mouse models whether they affect the hallmark signs of Alzheimer's.",A knowledge map to find Alzheimer's disease drugs,9641478,R01AG061105,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor', 'Animal Model', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Calculi', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Equilibrium', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Production', 'PubMed', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'database structure', 'disorder risk', 'drug testing', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'gene function', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'interest', 'molecular modeling', 'mouse model', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'protective factors', 'screening', 'stem', 'success', 'synergism', 'tau Proteins', 'text searching', 'virtual']",NIA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,792498,-0.023424273327951366
"DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are dangerous and expensive, afflicting about 1.5% of hospitalized patients with profound health and financial consequences. In Medicare patients alone, adverse drug reactions account for 19% of total spending ($339 billion), more than 1,900 deaths, and more than 77,000 extra hospital days per year. Idiosyncratic ADRs, especially rare and severe hypersensitivity-driven ADRs, are the leading cause of medicine withdrawal and termination of clinical development. At the same time, a large proportion of drugs are not associated with hypersensitivity driven ADRs, offering hope that new medicines could avoid them entirely with reliable predictors of risk. Hypersensitivity driven ADRs are caused by the formation of chemically reactive metabolites by metabolic enzymes. These reactive metabolites covalently attach to proteins to become immunogenic and provoke an ADR. Unfortunately, current computational and experimental approaches do not reliably identify drug candidates that form reactive metabolites. These approaches are limited because they inadequately model metabolism, which can both render toxic molecules safe and safe molecules toxic. To overcome this limitation, the proposed study aims to curate a public database of metabolism and reactivity and use this database to build accurate and validated mathematical models of metabolism and reactivity. The models will be constructed using machine-learning algorithms that quantitatively summarize the knowledge from thousands of published studies. The Aims are to (1) curate a database of metabolism and build models that identify rules governing the structure of reaction products during drug metabolism in the liver, (2) curate a database of reactivity and build improved reactivity models that mechanistically predict which metabolites are reactive with biological molecules, and (3) curate a database of reactive metabolites and combine these models to predict when molecules form reactive metabolites that covalently bind proteins. The computational models generated by these Aims will be validated through statistical approaches and against bench-top experiments. Taken together, this approach will substantially improve on existing approaches by more accurately modeling the properties determining whether metabolism renders drugs toxic or safe. The predictive models will make new medicines safer by helping researchers avoid molecules prone to ADRs without harming patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse drug reactions, especially rare but severe hypersensitivity-driven reactions, have profound financial and health implications and are caused by reactive drug metabolites. As an extension of tools and data developed by our groups, we will build and test mathematical models and datasets that more accurately predict when molecules form clinically important reactive metabolites than current methodologies, such as “structural alerts.” We will use these models to build a tool that will better predict when drug candidates form reactive metabolites, which will make new medicines safer by enabling researchers to avoid drug candidates prone to causing adverse reactions.",DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY,9479284,R01LM012222,"['Adverse reactions', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Activation', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Relative Risks', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Stevens-Johnson Syndrome', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'Withdrawal', 'adduct', 'clinical development', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug metabolism', 'drug withdrawal', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'liver metabolism', 'macromolecule', 'mathematical model', 'model building', 'novel', 'online repository', 'predictive modeling', 'protein function', 'quantum', 'repository', 'screening', 'tool']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,374026,0.050695012992965666
"Text Mining for High-fidelity Curation and Discovery of Gene-drug-phenotype Relationships Project Summary The rate at which new drugs are being introduced to market is decreasing, with grave implications for human health. Knowledge about the molecular mechanisms relevant to drug response is critical, but is collected in myriad individual experiments. As a result, the published literature contains rich information about how drugs and genes/gene products interact to produce phenotypes at the molecular, cellular and organismal levels, but this textual data requires substantial additional processing. As a result, there are efforts to manually curate the literature, and extract relationships between three key entities: genes/gene products, drugs and phenotypes—with the goal of representing the information in structured, computable formats. Although automated text mining may ultimately replace expert human curators, its best current role is to triage the literature and bring potentially important information to the attention of human curators. Recent advances in computational natural language processing (NLP) generally, and within our laboratory speciﬁcally, offer an opportunity to extract relationships between key entities with high accuracy. In particular, we have prototyped methods that take a relatively small set of examples of a relationship of interest (e.g. examples of gene-drug pairs in which the gene product metabolizes the drug) and then ﬁnd other pairs that share a similar relationship. These methods can be applied to any relationship between our three key entity types. Thus, we propose an ambitious plan to (1) gather large corpora of biomedical text and extend existing lexicons for these entities, (2) build a database of all sentences/paragraphs relating these entities to one another, (3) create methods for accurately extracting semantically precise relationships from all pairs of entity types, and (4) validate these extracted relationships using both available gold standard data experimental sources and expert curator evaluation.

"Comprehensive but simple encoding of bioassays to accelerate translational drug discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to extend its innovative software platform — BioAssay Express (BAE, version 1.0) — which helps biologists to quickly and easily encode their plain-text biological assay protocols into formats suitable for computational processing. In Phase 2B, CDD will further enhance BAE so that it can markup a bioassay with a comprehensive, detailed set of annotations that completely specifies the protocol, step by step. In its current state of development in Phase 2, BAE 1.0 enables scientists to summarize the English language text that specifies an experimental protocol, supplementing it with machine-interpretable descriptors. At the end of Phase 2B, BAE 2.0 will output a detailed machine- interpretable version that will be completely equivalent to, and can optionally substitute for, the traditional English language method description. The enhanced BAE 2.0 software will enable scientists engaged in early stage drug discovery to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures and intelligently aggregate datasets across research groups. An important benefit will be facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility by (1) flagging differences between closely related assays; (2) correlating differences in protocols with differences in results; and (3) improving the reproducibility of experiments conducted in different laboratories, to highlight potential causes of divergences. The project will continue to leverage the related broad initiatives at NIH and elsewhere that are working to promote translational research, gather screening data via open repositories, and apply sophisticated ontologies to classify these datasets. Our project targets the intersection of these disparate initiatives and unifies them by making their complex standards and guidelines for praxis realistically accessible to researchers who want to focus on their scientific work To encourage adoption, the software will prioritize intuitive ease of use by scientists who are not informatics experts, harmonize with existing laboratory workflows, minimize the extra effort of annotation, integrate seamlessly into preclinical data management platforms (including but not limited to CDD’s own CDD Vault), and deliver clear and immediate benefits to the user as part of an integrated experience. This combination of new capabilities and extreme ease of use will accelerate translational drug discovery efforts by empowering software platforms that bridge the divide between biologists and medicinal chemists to apply sophisticated tools — long available on the chemistry side — for the first time also to the biological side, and thus across both domains. Existing software can already easily connect screening results to chemical structures. This new platform will further connect these data to the purpose and methodology of the screens. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures, thereby facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility of data and assays. This fundamental capability ultimately accelerates translating new experimental discoveries into the development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. These tools will particularly benefit networks of researchers working on diseases that leading pharmaceutical companies have largely ignored because they are not perceived as highly profitable opportunities, despite the fact that in many cases they afflict millions of people.",Comprehensive but simple encoding of bioassays to accelerate translational drug discovery,9464228,R44TR000185,"['Academia', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'English Language', 'Ensure', 'Experimental Designs', 'Government', 'Guidelines', 'Improve Access', 'Incentives', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Screening Result', 'Semantics', 'Side', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'biomedical ontology', 'computerized tools', 'data management', 'drug discovery', 'empowered', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repository', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2018,744321,0.01254012897821349
"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,9568310,P50AR070590,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Custom', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Ohio', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Provider', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'Records', 'Records Controls', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Model', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'design', 'differential expression', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'mycobiome', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'synergism', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIAMS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,P50,2018,1308227,0.03608675108615172
"Social Media Mining for Pharmacovigilance Project Summary Drugs undergo extensive testing in animals and clinical trials in humans before they are marketed for widespread use. Pre-market testing produces reasonably high quality information about the efficacy of the drug as a treatment for the condition for which it was approved, but gives a very incomplete picture of the drug's safety. It is only after a drug is marketed and used on a more widespread basis over longer periods of time that it is possible to identify other effects, such as rare but serious adverse effects, or those that are more common in the special subgroups excluded from the trial (such as pregnant women), or effects of long-term use of the drug, among others. Despite the increase in research in the past years exploring social media data for pharmacovigilance, and the evidence that it indeed can bring forward the patient perspective, there is no systematic approach to collect and annotate such data for research purposes. This renewal builds on our prior research and natural language processing (NLP) methods for social media mining in pharmacovigilance to make the collection of social media data about medication use precise and systematic enough to be useful to researchers and the public, alongside established sources such as the FDA's data and other public collections of drug adverse event data. It presents innovative methods to automatically collect and analyze longitudinal health data, piloting methods for interventions through the same media that can inform the public and help validate the automatic methods. As validation, we include a comparison to an existing reference standard for adverse effects that integrates FDA's data and HER data, as well as specific case studies focused on (Aim 3.1) the use of NSAIDs and anti-depressants in pregnancy and (Aim 3.2) factors for non-adherence.

"Omics data integration and analysis for structure-based multi-target drug design Abstract Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), whole genome sequencing, and high-throughput techniques have generated vast amounts of diverse omics and phenotypic data. However, these sets of data have not yet been fully explored to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery, which continues along the one- drug-one-gene paradigm. Consequently, the cost of bringing a drug to market is staggering, and the failure rate is daunting. Our long-term goal is to revive the lagging pharmaceutical pipeline by identifying robust methods for achieving precision medicine. We will achieve this goal by developing a novel structural systems pharmacology approach to drug discovery, which integrates structure-based drug design with heterogeneous omics data integration and analysis in the context of the whole human and pathogen genome and interactome. An increasing body of evidence from both our group and others suggests that most drugs commonly interact with multiple receptors (targets). Both strong and weak multiple drug-target interactions can collectively mediate drug efficacy, toxicity, and resistance through the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. In order to rationally design potent, safe, and precision medicine, we face one of the major unsolved challenges in structure-based drug design: what are all the possible proteins and their conformational states interacting with a drug in an organism? This proposal attempts to address this challenge by developing, disseminating, and experimentally testing novel computational tools. Based on our successful preliminary results, we will develop an integrated computational pipeline to identify three-dimensional (3D) protein-chemical interaction models in the cellular context and on a structural proteome scale. Specifically, we will develop a quaternary structure- centric multi-layered network model by integrating heterogeneous data from genomics, proteomics, and phenomics. We will develop a novel collaborative one-class collaborative filtering algorithm to infer missing relations in the multi-layered network. We will combine tools derived from structural bioinformatics, biophysics, and machine learning to gain biological insights into the drug action. To facilitate the usability and reproducibility of the proposed algorithms, we will develop community-based web resources established by our previous experiences in developing the Protein Data Bank (PDB). More importantly, we will work closely with experimental laboratories to test the proposed computational tools using targeted kinase polypharmacology as a real-world example, and iteratively improve the performance and usability of algorithm, software, and web services. The successful completion of this project will provide the scientific community with: (1) new methods to enhance the scope and capability of high-throughput screening for structure-based multi-target drug design; (2) a user-friendly web service to support community-based drug discovery; and (3) potential novel anti-cancer targeted therapeutics. Together, these tools will advance drug discovery and precision medicine by providing a structural systems pharmacology toolkit. Relevance Statement The pharmaceutical industry is in a dire state. Both the cost to launch a new drug and the attrition rate are increasing. Methods that can correlate drug-target interactions with clinical outcomes will reduce both the cost of drug development and mortality rates during clinical trials and treatments.",Omics data integration and analysis for structure-based multi-target drug design,9545018,R01GM122845,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Docking', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Effectiveness', 'Extracellular Protein', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'anti-cancer therapeutic', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer therapy', 'cellular targeting', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high throughput screening', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'pathogen genome', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'receptor', 'small molecule', 'structural genomics', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web services', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,HUNTER COLLEGE,R01,2018,343028,0.10052593592068643
"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9593457,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Route', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serine containing aminolipid', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,276802,0.03971401977338835
"Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a suite of software modules to enable scientists to unambiguously represent chemical mixtures in standard machine-readable formats, filling an urgent and widely-recognized need. Chemicals are typically formulated as mixtures. Recording and communicating information about chemical mixtures is essential for scientists and support staff in the pharmaceutical industry, in academia, in non-profit research organizations, in government, at specialty chemical vendors, and at commercial manufacturers to: • discover, develop, formulate, manufacture and regulate drugs; • manage reagent inventories; comply with laboratory safety requirements; inform first responders; • describe and reproduce biomedical experiments; and • assess and disseminate information about toxicity risks of chemical reagents and consumer products.  A working committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is close to formalizing “Mixtures InChI” (or MInChI), which will extend the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) to become the first standard to encompass mixtures. MInChI will effectively index mixtures in the same way that InChI indexes individual compounds.  CDD will first develop the data structures and software necessary to enable adoption and utilization of MInChI and create the first general-purpose system for recording information about chemical mixtures that is computable and interoperable. The most innovative part of the project and the bulk of the effort will be to develop a sophisticated automated translation tool that will accurately convert legacy catalogs of chemical mixtures from plaintext descriptions or ad hoc formats so that they are properly represented in a machine readable format that can in turn be easily rendered into MInChI identifiers. The broad vision is to help industry to overcome the barriers to adoption so that MInChI can quickly deliver benefits for drug discovery, chemical safety, and toxicology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accurately document the composition of chemical mixtures in a format that computers can easily interpret, process, and exchange. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. It will also help to advance our understanding of the toxicology of mixtures (which often differs from the toxicology of individual components) and improve laboratory safety both in industry and in educational settings. !",Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation,9611819,R43TR002528,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Anti-HIV Agents', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Government', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Readability', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shorthand', 'Solvents', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'consumer product', 'data structure', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'emergency service responder', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R43,2018,149471,0.03848235905127521
"The HMS Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology PROJECT SUMMARY  Systems and computational biologists, physician-scientists, pharmacologists, biochemists and cell biologists will collaborate in a new Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP) to apply a measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. The LSP will pioneer the development of quantitative network-centric approaches to pharmacology and toxicology that include analysis of dose-time-response relationships at a single-cell level, modeling of cellular network dynamics and their perturbation by drugs, development of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models in mouse and ultimately in man and use of systematic approaches to identify and qualify new drug targets. Our approach combines mathematical modeling with empirical measurement (including work with clinical samples and data) and aims to create quantitative and predictive drug response models at different temporal and physical scales. We aim to reinvigorate pharmacology and toxicology as foundational disciplines of translational medicine, develop the conceptual underpinning for personalized and precision medicine and lower the cost of drug discovery by improving its predictability. Close interactions with industry and the FDA will help address the productivity gap in drug discovery and development. The LSP is innovative with respect to its goal of using problems in basic and translational pharmacology to link three disciplines (cell and molecular biology, computational biology and medicine) and its aim of advancing therapeutic science in the Boston area and beyond. Students and postdocs supervised by 18 faculty members, 2 independent postdoctoral fellows and two PhD-level staff from 7 institutions will work in immediate proximity in a new custom-designed laboratory. The lab will host a new graduate program in therapeutics and multi-factored outreach activities that will promote systems pharmacology internationally.  These goals will be achieved through four inter-linked research programs (Aims 1-4), a core dedicated to efficient translation of LSP research (Aim 5), an education core and administrative/outreach activities (Aims 6-8). Aim 1 will focus on the determinants of dose-response at a single-cell level, including the role of cell-to-cell variability in fractional response and of timing and order-of-exposure in combination therapy. Aim 2 will take a network-level approach to understanding therapeutic, toxic and paradoxical drug responses by kinase inhibitors in three types of cancer. The mechanistic basis and consequences of poly-pharmacology will also be examined along with differential drug responsiveness by normal and diseased tissues. Aim 3 will address PK-PD by developing multi-scale models of drug actions at the level of cells, tissues and organisms and new methods for measuring drug distribution at the cellular and subcellular levels. Aim 4 will apply machine learning and causal reasoning to target discovery from clinical records in asthma, inflammatory disease and fibrosis and pursue a structure-guided approach to identifying regulators of ""undruggable "" targets.

"Single cell molecular network mechanisms of cardiotoxicity induced by tyrosine kinase inhibitors As the number of cancer patients with stable disease increases, the long-term cardiotoxic effects of treatment with anti-cancer drugs become increasingly apparent. Cardiovascular-related mortality is 7-fold higher in childhood cancer survivors than expected from an age matched normal population and ~12% of breast cancer survivors suffer heart failure within three years of treatment. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are exemplars of promising anti-cancer drugs whose use is complicated by cardiotoxicity. Whether this reflects drug-mediated inhibition of the same signaling pathways as the anti-oncogenic effects of these drugs is unclear. Cardiotoxic phenotypes induced by chemically diverse TKIs include life-threatening heart failure and cardiac infarction, and are likely to include targets that are not the nominal ones; this is particularly true of poly- selective TKIs. Identifying the precise mechanisms of TKI-mediated cardiotoxicity has the potential to substantially improve cancer care and also reveal fundamental aspects of cardiac cell biology.  My project exploits the recent development of reproducible means to transdifferentiate human induced pluripotent stem cell into cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and probe the biology of these cells using omic and “systems biology” methods. I have collected extensive preliminary data on hiPSC-CMs responses to over 50 different drug perturbations and am in the midst of using statistical regression and machine learning algorithms to define and study the molecular networks associated with TKI-induced cardiotoxicity. I have already found that cardiac energy metabolism is dysregulated by many cardiotoxic drugs and could be biomarker of cardiotoxicity more broadly. In this proposal, I will build on my profiling data through focused study of Sorafenib, a drug that I have shown to increase anaerobic glycolysis in hiPSC-CMs. As a multi-target drug, Sorafenib inhibits multiple kinases and gene networks. Identifying targets relevant to cardiotoxicity is a key goal of my research. I will tackle this by establishing the sequential onset of molecular networks after drug treatment and their causal relation with the increased glycolysis phenotype. Single cell heterogeneous molecular responses will be analyzed to find non-genetic mechanisms that determine the differential sensitivity of cardiotoxicity to Sorafenib. I will build quantitative models to fit and explain data at population and single cell levels. Ultimately, to find means to increase therapeutic effects, I want to systematically compare target expression, phenotypic responses and molecular mechanisms induced by Sorafenib in both hiPSC-CMs and hepatocellular carcinoma cells (treated by Sorafenib clinically). My study will generate pilot methods in converting “big data” into mechanistic insights in cardiac biology, and facilitate development of new therapies to mitigate cardiotoxicity without compromising efficacy of cancer elimination. PROJECT NARRATIVE The use of many cancer drugs, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, is complicated by cardiotoxicity, which can be debilitating and life-threating but is poorly understood. My research aims to understand the molecular changes associated with drug-induced cardiotoxicity as a means to screen for adverse effects in new drug, identify patients who are particularly susceptible to heart damage and develop strategies for mitigating such toxicity.",Single cell molecular network mechanisms of cardiotoxicity induced by tyrosine kinase inhibitors,9541584,F32HL142231,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Aerobic', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiac development', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Genes', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'HIF1A gene', 'Heart', 'Heart Hypertrophy', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Hydrogels', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Ion Channel', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'MAP Kinase Gene', 'MAPK14 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Network-based', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncogenic', 'Organ', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Potassium Channel', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Proteomics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Regulation', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sarcomeres', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stable Disease', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcript', 'Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'anaerobic glycolysis', 'antitumor effect', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer cell', 'cardioprotection', 'cellular imaging', 'chemical genetics', 'childhood cancer survivor', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'glucose metabolism', 'heart damage', 'human model', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'mitochondrial membrane', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'non-genetic', 'novel therapeutics', 'precision oncology', 'response', 'transcription factor', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F32,2018,12484,0.022542391609257157
"Development of targeted, safe and effective drugs against pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by leveraging a novel, comprehensive, computational drug discovery approach Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States with a median survival of <6 months and a 5-yr survival rate of 3%-8%. The aggressive biology and resistance to currently used therapeutic agents underscore the clear unmet need for the development of effective therapies against PDAC. Development of therapeutically important small molecules has benefited from computational drug discovery methods over three decades. However, these approaches suffer from significant limitations. twoXAR has developed a computational drug discovery approach that overcomes these limitations. Building on our prior success in identifying candidate drugs for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we propose to use an artificial intelligence (AI) driven platform developed by twoXAR to identify new drug candidates as potential effective therapies for PDAC. In preliminary studies, we showed that TXR-311, a lead candidate selected based on our platform for efficacy against HCC significantly inhibited growth of: (a) HCC cell-lines, but not healthy hepatocytes and (b) orthotopic mouse HCC patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Moreover, (c) we also used our AI-based approach to predict validated candidates for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The efficiency in drug discovery resulting from computational models provides an opportunity to build a portfolio of drug programs that traditional discovery methods don't allow for without hundreds of millions of dollars and many years. twoXAR’s approach to developing drug pipeline through partnerships and spin-outs enables us to apply our technology broadly across therapeutic areas, put drug development in the hands of expert drug developers, and create a portfolio of drug programs that significantly increases the probability of a twoXAR-discovered treatment benefiting patients. In the current Phase I SBIR proposal, we will identify candidate drugs to treat PDAC, using our platform. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Leverage twoXAR’s AI platform to identify lead candidates to treat PDAC. Milestone: Screen at least 100 hits that emerge based on aggregate scoring and identify at least 10 leads for further analysis and in vitro/in vivo validation. Aim 2: Use industry-standard preclinical assays to validate lead drug candidates. Milestone: Identification of a primary lead candidate for the treatment of PDAC. After successful completion of the proposed studies, we will develop the identified lead candidate for the treatment of PDAC through a Phase II SBIR mechanism to conduct mechanism of action (MoA), safety, and efficacy studies followed by early feasibility human studies, with the overarching goal of regulatory submission to the FDA and market commercialization. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States with a median survival of <6 months, and resistance to currently used therapeutic agents. twoXAR has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) driven platform to identify new drug candidates as potential effective therapies.

"The Interdependency of Drug Resistance Evolution and Drug Design: HIV-1 Protease DESCRIPTION: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies. The pressures of evolution will likely result in a variety of pathways for resistance to evolve. Drug resistance can be caused by a change in the balance of molecular recognition events that selectively weakens inhibitor binding but maintains the biological function of the therapeutic target. To reduce the likelihood of drug resistance, the interdependency of the target's function within the context of the biological system in which it exists must be elucidated. Disrupting the therapeutic target's activity is necessary but not sufficient for avoiding resistance. In this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that key pathways and coupled mechanisms confer drug resistance to therapeutic targets. We seek to define the sequence, structural and dynamic, and temporal evolutionary constraints of the interdependency of drug resistance: 1) to recognize the pathways by which resistance occurs and 2) to devise drug design strategies for developing a drug that is robust against resistance. HIV-1 Protease is the perfect case study! HIV evolves very quickly with on average a point mutation introduced in every third genome replicated. HIV protease inhibitors have the potential of being both very potent and robust to resistance. Protease inhibitors are the only HIV inhibitor class that are transition state analogs and can be evolutionarily constrained within the substrate envelope. Inhibitors that leverage both of these characteristics, such as Darunavir (DRV) and similar analogs, have the potential of being robust, nearly resistance proof inhibitors, to drug- naïve HIV infected patients. If HIV achieves resistance to these inhibitors it is only through complex pathways and combinations of mutations. Further elucidating these complex pathways will bring us closer to resistance-proof inhibitors. In this project our team will use and develop cutting-edge technology to follow the pathways of drug resistance selection, to elucidate the molecular basis for their interdependent patterns and incorporate these mechanisms into drug design strategies. Together we will make inroads into tackling drug resistance that would be impossible for any of us to individually achieve PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies.

"Doctor Shopping for Controlled Substances: Insights from Two-Mode Social Network Analysis The proposed project will analyze patterns of doctor shopping for prescription opioids and benzodiazepines using two-mode (i.e. affiliation) social network analysis (SNA). Abuse of prescription opioids and benzodiazepines in the U.S. has risen rapidly, creating a public health crisis. Mortality from drug overdose is higher than motor vehicle accidents and is among the nation's leading preventable causes of death. Doctor shopping is defined as obtaining controlled substances from multiple health care practitioners simultaneously, exceeding the recommended dosage. Doctor shopping is a principle method of obtaining controlled substances for misuse, and an indicator of escalating drug abuse that is associated with a two-fold risk for fatal overdose. Lack of consensus about criteria for classifying doctor shopping has led to wide variation in estimated rates of questionable prescribing activity. This ambiguity poses barriers to understanding factors underlying doctor shopping, and impedes the evaluation of prescription drug policies. Currently, numerical thresholds or multiple provider episodes (MPEs; i.e. overlapping prescriptions) are most often used to identify doctor shoppers, resulting in false positives and negatives. A goal of the proposed study is to determine whether incorporating information about actors' structural position in a two-mode social network of patients and prescribers can produce more valid indictors of illicit behavior. Two-mode network analysis focuses on ties between two different classes or sets of entities. In the proposed project, data form a two-mode network with prescribers in one class and patients in the other, and ties are present only between prescribers and patients. Two-mode SNA is ideal for examining structural patterns in social interaction between two sets of actors, and for determining the most active and central actors in a network. Consistently targeting prescribers that are key players in prescription drug networks may be indicative of strategic doctor shopping behavior or information sharing among patients. Insights from SNA will be used to fine-tune doctor-shopping indicators, improving our ability to detect early signs of abuse, as well as behavior that is intermittent, ambiguous, or less intense, but still problematic. The specific aims of the proposed study are to: 1) Utilize SNA to develop and assess network- based metrics of doctor shopping in comparison to traditional indicators; and 2) Identify characteristics of doctor shopping patients, targeted prescribers, and the point of service. To our knowledge, this is the first study of prescription drug abuse to use two-mode SNA as its methodological approach. This study is significant in applying two-mode SNA – a complex, systems science methodology – to drug abuse research and has the potential to facilitate cost-effective information extraction from extant datasets for translation to policy and practice. The long-term goal of this research is to leverage insights from SNA to improve detection and prevention of doctor shopping and related fraudulent activities, and ultimately reduce the prevalence and public health impact of prescription drug abuse. Abuse of prescription opioids and benzodiazepines has reached epidemic status, and is currently among the nation’s leading preventable causes of death. The proposed research examines social network ties between patients and their prescribing clinicians in a large insurance claims database to identify patterns of prescription seeking that indicate fraudulent activity (e.g. doctor shopping) and possible information sharing among patients who abuse prescription drugs. The goals of this research are to improve detection of early, intermittent, and ambiguous signs of prescription drug abuse behaviors, and to better understand characteristics of patients who engage in doctor shopping and the clinicians they target.",Doctor Shopping for Controlled Substances: Insights from Two-Mode Social Network Analysis,9505861,R01DA039928,"['Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Doctor shopping', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug abuse', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Services', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Solo Practices', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Translations', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'care coordination', 'cost effective', 'dosage', 'drug seeking behavior', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insight', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'novel', 'operation', 'prescription drug abuse', 'prescription monitoring program', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid abuse', 'response', 'standard measure', 'substance misuse', 'trend', 'vehicular accident']",NIDA,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2018,317590,0.023229045671444765

"Utilization of Phenotypic Precision Medicine to Identify Optimal Drug Combinations for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma PROJECT SUMMARY  The authors have developed a computational platform to rapidly identify optimal drug and dose combinations from the innumerable possibilities. By testing this technique termed Phenotypic Personalized Medicine (PPM) in a diverse number of experimental systems representing different diseases, they have found that the response of biological systems to drugs can be described by a low order, smooth multidimensional surface. The main consequence of this is that optimal drug combinations can be found in a small number of tests and that translation from in vitro to in vivo and ultimately to clinical application is enabled through a re- optimization process. This input–output relationship that is always based on experimental data in lieu of predicted responses may also lead to a straightforward solution for handling human diversity in cancer therapeutics, among other diseases. In these series of studies they will test the hypothesis that PPM can be developed and validated for clinical use by using it to find novel drug combinations of repurposed/repositioned drugs to treat hepatocellular carcinoma. The goal is that by the end of year 3 of this project, they will be able to initiate a clinical trial using these novel combination or combinations.  This group has previously used PPM-based optimization to find novel drug combinations in in vitro and in vivo models of cancer and infection. They have shown that this approach was able to markedly improve the efficacy of colorectal cancer therapy in vivo in mouse models. Translationally in a first-in-human clinical trial, they recently completed a prospective clinical study involving 4 PPM-dosed patients and 4 control (standard of care dosed) patients. They calculated the tacrolimus dosing regimen using the PPM process. Because PPM does not require a priori knowledge of disease mechanism and because it is a dynamic process that can accommodate a changing system, it can efficiently find personalized drug dosing over a varying range of time, having a profound stabilizing effect on the tacrolimus trough levels.  For this application, they have selected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, liver cancer) to be the human disease for PPM application. The key rationale for this clinical selection is that they have a wealth of in vitro data on HCC, an active HCC tumor biorepository, and a large clinical volume of patients with HCC. These existing resources, both in vitro and clinical, allow for the immediate exploration of combination discovery followed by a clinical validation of discovered combination candidates in patients with unresectable HCC. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project applies a computational platform (Phenotypic Precision Medicine) to optimize combination therapy for the treatment of liver cancer. Using empiric measurements of the responses to a given treatment regimen by liver cancer cell lines and mouse models, they will demonstrate a computational approach to finding and optimizing novel drug combinations using repurposed/repositioned drugs. First they will demonstrate the ability to devise novel combination therapies and then they will start planning for a clinical trial to test the feasibility and efficacy of this approach to the treatment of liver cancer.",Utilization of Phenotypic Precision Medicine to Identify Optimal Drug Combinations for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma,9568854,UH2TR002087,"['BAY 54-9085', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer cell line', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Regimen', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Unresectable', 'Validation', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'biobank', 'biological systems', 'clinical application', 'colorectal cancer treatment', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'first-in-human', 'hepatocellular carcinoma cell line', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'process optimization', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tumor']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,UH2,2018,269386,0.03633719193222451
"Computationally modeling the impact of ontogeny on drug metabolic fate   ABSTRACT Advancements in pediatric drug development require innovative approaches that overcome challenges in assessing age-dependent drug disposition and toxic risks related to metabolism. Cytochromes P450 dominate drug metabolism yet roles for individual enzymes depend on genetics, disease states, co-medications, and ontogeny. Failure to account for those differences contributes to dosing challenges and possibly toxicity as reported for dextromethorphan, midazolam, and phenytoin. The NICHD Pediatric Formulation Initiative (PFI) workshops emphasized the need for better modeling to describe and predict how drug metabolism changes for children. Current pharmacokinetic models predict how drug clearance changes with age that affect the optimal dose, but those models are limited in two ways; (1) they require experimentally determined kinetic data for several enzymes that is not often available, and (2) they do not model formation of specific drug metabolites, which is important in predicting toxicity and drug interactions, regardless of whether clearance changes with age. We hypothesize that computational models of mixtures of P450 enzymes can predict how the “metabolic fate”, i.e. the kinetics of drug metabolism and the resulting metabolite structures, of drugs changes with age. We propose building hierarchical mathematical models that at first predict the drug metabolites formed by metabolic enzymes (Aim 1), then the efficiency of formation for each metabolite (the kinetics) (Aim 2), and combine these models to predict metabolites formed by age-specific mixtures of P450s (Aim 3). This proposal makes significant steps toward achieving PFI goals. First, datasets created for this study will be made publicly available to foster model refinement and validation by the community. Second, simulation of metabolite profiles would yield tractable biomarkers and support studies on possible age-dependent drug-drug interactions, off- target biological activities, pro-drug activation, and formation of toxic species. Third, the models will indicate, for both new and existing drugs, when metabolic fate (consequently, toxicity and interactions) changes in pediatric patients, even when pharmacokinetics stay the same. Fourth, though not the primary aim of this study, successfully modeling metabolic efficiency could enable pharmacokinetic studies for predicting problematic pediatric drugs prior to carrying out any necessary experimental kinetic studies. Taken together, this proposal lays a strong foundation for developing models relevant that resolve challenges in optimizing drug dosages and minimizing toxicity risks for children.   PROJECT NARRATIVE The impact of age on cytochrome P450 metabolism makes drug disposition and toxic risks moving targets for pediatric patients, such that robust strategies to identify and assess ontogenetic (age-dependent) effects on drug metabolic fate (in vitro kinetics and metabolite structures) are clearly needed to better personalize drug development for pediatric dosing. As an extension of our prior work, we will build and test computational models and datasets for individual P450 isozymes that accurately predict drug metabolites and the rate (kinetics) at which they form. We will then combine these models for an effective, low cost approach that simulates hepatic P450 metabolism and takes into account age-dependent contributions from individual isozymes to assess the metabolic fate of drugs during child development.  ",Computationally modeling the impact of ontogeny on drug metabolic fate,9540939,R01LM012482,"['Access to Information', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Chemical Models', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dextromethorphan', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Educational workshop', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Failure', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hepatic', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Isoenzymes', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Microsomes', 'Midazolam', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacology and Toxicology', 'Phenytoin', 'Prodrugs', 'Property', 'Reaction', 'Recombinants', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxin', 'Validation', 'Work', 'absorption', 'age related', 'base', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'dosage', 'drug clearance', 'drug development', 'drug metabolism', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pediatric patients', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'repository', 'response', 'simulation', 'tool']",NLM,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2018,313125,0.10144328071766655
"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects. Systematic study of therapeutic and adverse drug responses using diverse experimental technologies and the latest data science and machine learning methods is essential for bringing about the next wave of precision cancer medicine.",Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs,9475020,U54CA225088,"['Achievement', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Area', 'BRAF gene', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Logic', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Newsletter', 'Non-Malignant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Proteomics', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Software Tools', 'Specimen', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Translating', 'acquired drug resistance', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical research site', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging modality', 'immune checkpoint', 'improved', 'inhibiting antibody', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multiple omics', 'mutant', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical', 'precision oncology', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'small molecule', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U54,2018,2147606,0.02244908866801225
"Systems Pharmacological Analysis of Drug Efficacy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Project Summary/Abstract Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects more than 1 million Americans and has been increasing in prevalence in the last decade. IBD consists of two diseases, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which are both characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and can manifest with similar symptoms. Despite their similarities, the diseases are very heterogeneous and consist of complex interactions between the immune system, the microbiome, and the affected tissue. Characterizing the two diseases at the molecular level has been met with limited success, and the lack of a clear mechanistic pathway has resulted in the lack of efficacy of existing treatments in subsets of IBD patients. Previous methods have focused primarily on gene enrichment analysis, but these studies have shown inconsistent results and do not offer mechanistic insights into disease development. Systems pharmacological methods offer several advantages over traditional gene-based approaches by using networks to characterize relationships between genes, which enables the application of powerful analyses using graph theory. These methods enable us to use the topology of protein interaction networks to elucidate disease mechanisms and characterize network perturbations caused by drugs. Furthermore, with the advent of cheaper and more accurate modalities to quantify molecular profiles and the increasing availability of molecular data, we now have the ability to leverage multiple data sources to create a multifaceted approach to understanding the mechanism of IBD. Thus, by combining protein-protein interaction data, drug target data, and drug perturbation data, we aim to (1) construct personalized molecular networks for UC and CD, (2) develop a supervised network method to model drug effects, and (3) identify and validate novel drugs for treatment responders and nonresponders. With success, we will have the ability to distinguish treatment responders from nonresponders and have identified potential novel drug candidates to treat IBD. Furthermore, we will have a more thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of IBD, which will enable the development of more effective therapies to alleviate the suffering of millions worldwide. Project Narrative Inflammatory bowel disease affects over a million people in the United States, and many affected patients do not respond to current therapies. This proposal addresses this challenge by developing methods to discern patients unlikely to respond to these therapies and identifying novel therapeutic agents for drug responders and drug nonresponders. The results of this proposal have the potential to impact treatment strategies and is relevant to the improved treatment and clinical care of inflammatory bowel disease.",Systems Pharmacological Analysis of Drug Efficacy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,9559392,F30AI124553,"['Address', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Drug Modelings', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Network-based', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'drug candidate', 'drug efficacy', 'drug response prediction', 'effective therapy', 'graph theory', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'ineffective therapies', 'infliximab', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbiome', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'protein protein interaction', 'reduce symptoms', 'response', 'success', 'treatment responders', 'treatment strategy', 'vector']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F30,2018,43051,0.06600939698105787
"Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization Project Summary  The proposed work will accelerate the pace of drug discovery by developing, validating, and testing new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug design. Two fundamental challenges of structure-based drug design are the accurate scoring and ranking of protein-ligand structures, which identiﬁes active com- pounds, and the ability to efﬁciently search a large number of ligands, which ensures that active compounds are sampled. This proposal will address these challenges by developing a novel approach for protein-ligand scoring and expanding the size of the chemical space that can be efﬁciently searched during lead optimiza- tion. The methods will be validated by their prospective application toward the discovery of new anti-cancer molecules and will be made readily accessible through online resources and open-source tools.  The proposal leverages recent and signiﬁcant advances in deep learning and image recognition to develop scoring functions that accurately recognize high-afﬁnity protein-ligand interactions. This is achieved by design- ing and training convolutional neural nets on three-dimensional representations of protein-ligand structures to discriminate between binders and non-binders. Convolutional neural net training will exploit large datasets of afﬁnity and structural data to automatically extract the relevant features necessary to accurately prioritize compounds. Additionally, the proposal develops the ﬁrst means of fully integrating a convolutional neural net scoring function directly into an energy minimization and docking workﬂow.  Interactive virtual screening enables the search of millions of compounds in a few seconds so that queries can be interactively optimized. Interactivity enables the synergistic uniﬁcation of human expert knowledge and efﬁcient computational algorithms. The proposed work will dramatically expand the size of chemical space ac- cessible through interactive virtual screening. Algorithms for efﬁciently searching the chemical space of billions or trillions of compounds implicitly deﬁned by a set of reaction schemas and fragments will be created as part of a lead optimization workﬂow. Fragment-oriented search will be accelerated by a new data structure that combines pharmacophore and molecular shape information into a single sub-linear time index.  The scoring and lead optimization methods developed in this proposal will be released as open-source soft- ware and made immediately available through open-access online resources. As part of the prospective valida- tion of the proposed methods, these resources will be used to identify hit compounds and optimize leads for two targets related to cancer metabolism: serine hydroxymethyltransferase and kidney glutaminase isoform C. Successful completion of the objectives of this proposal will positively impact public health by reducing the cost and time-to-market of developing new drugs, particularly with respect to novel protein targets. Project Narrative  Researchers will be able to more quickly and accurately identify potential drug candidates using the new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug discovery created by this project. These tools will be readily accessible through open-access web sites and open-source software. As part of the project these tools will be used to identify new molecules that are relevant to the treatment of cancer.","Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization",9419924,R01GM108340,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Glutaminase', 'Glutamine', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RANK protein', 'Reaction', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'lead optimization', 'molecular shape', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'overexpression', 'pharmacophore', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'resource guides', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web interface', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,312167,0.03227973233936409
"Peripheral Nerve-on-a-chip for Predictive Preclinical Pharmaceutical Testing PROJECT SUMMARY The drug development pipeline is plagued by unacceptable rates of attrition due in large part to toxicities that are not identified in pre-clinical stages of development. The ability to de-risk lead compounds during pre-clinical development with advanced “organoid-on-a-chip” technologies shows tremendous promise. Drug-induced neurotoxicity is caused by off-target effects of pharmaceuticals that lead to sensory, motor, and cognitive deficits. While rarely fatal, drug-induced neurotoxicity can lead to permanent nerve damage and in some cases can be a dose-limiting side effect, leading patients to reduce dosage or stop treatment altogether. Although the peripheral nervous system bears the brunt of this neurological toxicity, development of microphysiological models of the peripheral nervous system is lagging. Towards that end, the technology described herein allows for 3D growth of high density axonal fiber tracts, resembling peripheral nerve anatomy. Progress during the prior award phase strongly demonstrated the feasibility of using microengineered neural tissues that are amenable to morphological and physiological measurements analogous to those of clinical tests. The use of structural and functional analyses should mean drug-induced neural toxicity will manifest in these measurements in ways that mimic clinical neuropathology. The goals of this proposal are to establish our human model using relevant physiological measurements in tissues fabricated from human iPS cells, and to validate the model system with a library of compounds, comparing against conventional cell culture models. Validating the peripheral nerve model system with drugs known to induce toxicity via a range of mechanisms will demonstrate the ability of the system to predict various classifications of neuropathy, yielding a high-content assay far more informative than traditional in vitro systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current methods available for bringing drugs to market have resulted in high attrition rates as compounds progress through the drug pipeline, resulting in unacceptable clinical trial toxicity and skyrocketing pharmaceutical prices.

"Novel computational approaches for pharmacogenomic discovery PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Affordable high-throughput genome sequencing technologies had been expected to usher an era of precision medicine, whereby each patient receives an individualized treatment based on their genetic profile. However, precision medicine is yet to realize this potential and the number of clinically applied drug biomarkers lags far behind the number proposed in the scientific literature. Lack of reproducibility of proposed biomarkers has been highly problematic, and in particular the lack of effectiveness of biomarkers identified in pre-clinical studies when applied in clinical trial. In cancer, the number of drugs with FDA approved biomarkers remains at less than 30, and almost all of these arose because a drug was designed to target a specific known driver gene. Overall, only a handful of clinically actionable biomarkers have been discovered for drugs already in use. The objective of this project is to develop computational methods that will improve on existing biomarker discovery, and ultimately improve patient care and survival. My first aim is to develop an approach that will allow me to impute drug sensitivity in very large clinical datasets, such as TCGA. This imputed data will then be compared to measured markers in these data (e.g. somatic mutations) in order to identify novel predictors of drug response. The statistical models used to impute drug sensitivity will be developed in a pre-clinical disease model, where drug response has been accurately measured. In my second aim I will quantify the contribution of germline genetic variation to drug response in cancer. “Germline genetic variation” refers to the common genetic differences that exist between individuals, which are for the most part preserved in tumors. The contribution of this inter-individual genetic variation to variability in drug response between patients remains unquantified, although it is becoming clearer that it plays an important role. Finally, I will combine the information gathered in the first steps and build effective integrative models of drug response. Following the R00 phase (R01 and beyond), I envision that such models will be tested in patients; subsequently, measured drug response in these cohorts will be used to further refine future predictions. This will result in a framework where models actively improve their predictive performance as more data is gathered over time. To ensure the success of this project, I have assembled an expert mentorship team for the K99 phase, which includes a statistician, wet-lab biologists and clinicians, thus covering the entire scope of the precision medicine discovery and implementation pipeline. The University of Chicago, a world-class research institution, will provide the ideal environment and resources for such a cross-disciplinary, collaborative endeavor. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite enormous investment in precision medicine, most drug repurposing and biomarker discovery strategies have failed when applied in the clinic. This project will improve drug treatments by developing novel computational methods that will allow us to find new biomarkers and to better predict which patients will respond to what drugs, with application to cancer.

"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions. There is however, considerable interindividual variation in efficacy of statins for reducing disease risk, as well as in susceptibility to the most common adverse statin effects, myopathy and type 2 diabetes. The goal of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply complementary investigative approaches and multidisciplinary expertise for discovering and validating the genetic and metabolic factors responsible for this variability. This information has the potential for optimizig use of statins in clinical practice, and for identifying new pathways that underlie the diverse biologic actions of this drug class.              ",Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy,9560840,P50GM115318,"['Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Simvastatin', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'blood glucose regulation', 'candidate validation', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'coronary event', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genotyped patients', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblast', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RES CTR AT OAKLAND,P50,2018,2667664,0.030219809588937847
"Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health 7. Project Summary Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, having eclipsed motor vehicle-related deaths in 2008. A number of interventions have emerged in the last decade in response to this epidemic, including prescription drug monitoring programs; improving linkages to drug treatment; training drug users and those around them to recognize and respond appropriately to overdose; and, most recently, training and equipping law enforcement officers to use naloxone (an opioid antagonist) at the scene of an overdose.  Equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone is intended to capitalize on the fact that officers often arrive at an overdose scene before other emergency services, particularly in rural areas, and until now have not been well equipped to deal with overdose events. In the last 5 years, with the active encouragement of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Department of Justice, law enforcement agencies in at least 28 states are planning to or have begun carrying naloxone to use when they attend overdoses. Despite the proliferation of such programs, this intervention is completely unstudied.  In 2014 the San Diego Sheriff’s Department began training patrol officers to use naloxone to respond to overdose prior to arrival of other emergency services, and to actively refer overdose victims to a collaborating drug treatment agency after revival. Uptake of drug treatment has been higher than expected (3 of 9 revivals in the 6 month pilot phase of the project entered treatment). We hypothesize that the moments after an overdose represent a “teachable moment” in which drug users may be more motivated to enter treatment. In addition, we hypothesize that having law enforcement officers respond to overdose as a medical emergency rather than as a crime scene may make drug users more willing to call 911 when someone overdoses.  The overarching goal of this study is to determine the impact of law enforcement use of naloxone to respond to drug overdoses on two primary outcomes: (1) uptake of drug treatment referrals by overdose victims referred by law enforcement officers, and (2) rates of calling 911 to summon emergency medical services by drug users who witness overdoses. We will achieve these aims through a mixed methods study that includes secondary analysis of data available through our partnership with SDSD, their drug treatment partners the McAlister Institute, and the County of San Diego, including 911 dispatch data, SDSD case records, and treatment data. To complement these data we will conduct qualitative interviews with a community-recruited sample of drug users, to assess their perspectives around treatment referrals provided by SDSD Deputies, and their willingness to call 911 in the event of witnessed overdoses. Interviews and analysis will utilize methods drawn from grounded theory and ethnographic decision tree modeling (a rigorous qualitative method used to describe how individuals and organizations make decisions in given situations). 8. Project Narrative Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, with more people dying of overdose than in motor vehicles. One recent response to such deaths is equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone (an overdose antidote which can be sprayed into an overdose victim’s nose), and training them to refer overdose victims to drug treatment once they are revived.  This study will look at the use of naloxone by the San Diego Sheriff’s Department, and will be the first research project in the world to investigate whether or not having law enforcement officers refer drug users to treatment immediately after an overdose is effective, and whether or not having law enforcement officers respond to an overdose as a medical emergency rather than a law enforcement issue makes drug users more likely to call 911 when someone overdoses.",Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health,9688417,R01DA040648,"['911 call', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Antidotes', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'County', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Drug Controls', 'Drug user', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnography', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Fatality rate', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Lawyers', 'Life', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Naloxone', 'Natural experiment', 'Nose', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Organizational Decision Making', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'base', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'empowered', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'peer', 'prescription monitoring program', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'rural area', 'secondary analysis', 'theories', 'uptake', 'willingness']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,101470,0.08778591991222247
"Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens ABSTRACT Patients with atrial fibrillation, post-acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism are prescribed antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet agents and oral anticoagulants) in dual and triple combinations. These drugs independently cause gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from mucosal defects or vascular abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiac patients are the fastest growing at-risk group due to the rapidly aging US population, their high-burden of co-morbidity, frequent antithrombotic polypharmacy and prescription of new antithrombotic drugs with higher incidence of GI adverse events. The real-world GIB risk of antithrombotic agents used in combination in a diverse cardiac population has yet to be characterized. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated poor performance of existing risk scores (HAS-BLED, CHA2DS2-VASC etc.) for the prediction of non- warfarin antithrombotic drug bleeding; scores frequently used in the clinical setting despite their inaccuracy. Absence of knowledge regarding the real-world risk of antithrombotic-GIB, and the inability to accurately predict which patients will bleed, hampers patient counselling regarding a frequently occurring adverse event which is known to cause morbidity and mortality among cardiac patients. We propose to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying GIB risk in a large, geographically diverse cohort of elderly and non-elderly cardiac patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism or post-acute coronary syndrome. GIB associated with antithrombotic drug combinations will be stratified by underlying cardiac conditions; incidence rates (events/100 patient-years) and propensity-matched Cox proportional models (with 95% confidence intervals) will be used to estimate outcome. We will examine heterogeneity of safety effects related to age, chronic co-morbidity, and hepatic or renal dysfunction. Machine learning techniques will then be used to derive and validate a highly sensitive algorithm for the prediction of antithrombotic-related GIB. Discovery of such an algorithm is the first step in the future application of a predictive model in any evidence-based clinical delivery platform, such as a decision rule or risk calculator. NARRATIVE Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in cardiac patients is common, deadly and on the rise due to an older population, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs used in combination, and availability of new drugs with higher GIB risk than their predecessors. Lack of data regarding the magnitude of GIB and limited knowledge of which patients are most at risk, prevents accurate counselling regarding cardiac drug safety. We will quantify this risk, study risk factors; and use machine learning techniques to derive and validate a clinical algorithm to better predict at-risk patients.",Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens,9519828,R01HS025402,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R01,2018,392266,0.025114962061565386
"Meta-Analysis and Machine Learning: Towards Neuromarkers of Craving and Relapse Abstract The experience of drug craving is known to increase drug use1-6 and relapse after treatment7-16. Specifically, drug-related stimuli are known to elicit cue-induced craving, as well as physiological and neural responses, called cue reactivity, which have all been directly linked to drug use and relapse across addictions17-35, including gambling36-39. To date, hundreds of studies investigated neural cue-reactivity; however, there is little consensus in findings, due to significant variation in methods, drug types, cue types, and analysis procedures. Further, prior meta-analyses used suboptimal methods and inclusion criteria, and were underpowered40-44. In Aim 1, we propose to use state-of-the-art meta-analytic methods45-47 to summarize findings from ~120 published imaging studies, representing >3000 participants during neural cue reactivity/cue- induced craving (and 3x larger than any prior meta-analysis). Following our prior meta-analytic work in other domains48-61, we will use optimized inclusion criteria and correction methods, and account for multiple methodological differences in studies across substances (e.g., cigarettes, alcohol, cocaine, cannabis) and gambling, a behavioral addiction. Further, we will test for differences across drug types (e.g., cigarettes vs. alcohol) and different cue-types (e.g., pictures vs. video) to resolve several open questions in the field (e.g., role of insula in cigarette craving vs. drug craving in general62, 63; pre-scan abstinence64, 65). In Aim 2, we will go beyond meta-analysis to address an urgent need in addiction research66: development of predictive biomarkers67-69, which are stable indicators of biological processes. Biomarkers have been developed in other areas of medicine70, and we have recently done this in pain71, negative emotion72-74, and empathy74. To do this, we will combine the meta-analytic results obtained in Aim 1 with person-level fMRI data from our lab (of cue-induced craving75-79) using machine learning models, to establish a multivariate pattern of neural activity that can predict craving self-report from neural activity – a predictive neuromarker for craving. Given the associations between neural cue reactivity, craving, and drug use outcome, a multivariate neuromarker could provide a powerful neural predictor of outcomes66, 67. Thus, in Aim 3, we will validate this neuromarker on data from two ongoing clinical trials of N=128 cigarette smokers and N=150 cocaine users collected at Yale's Psychotherapy Development Center (P50 DA09241; Center PI: Carroll; Project PI: Kober). Here, the neuromarker will be used on pre-treatment fMRI cue-reactivity data to predict both self-reported craving and long-term clinical outcomes (e.g., cocaine abstinence). The validated neuromarker will provide well-defined brain targets that can then be used to test the efficacy of interventions to reduce craving and drug use, such as pharmacotherapies, brain stimulation, or cognitive training, and to monitor patient progress in both research and clinical settings. ! Project Narrative Among substance users, exposure to drug cues is associated with neural cue reactivity and cue-induced craving, both of which are directly linked to addiction severity and relapse after treatment. We will employ state-of-the-art statistical and computational methods to establish a consistent neural pattern associated with cue reactivity and cue-induced craving. Then we will validate it using recently-collected imaging data – moving towards a predictive biomarker of drug craving, which can be used to investigate brain processes related to treatment efficacy and drug use outcomes in research as well as clinical settings.",Meta-Analysis and Machine Learning: Towards Neuromarkers of Craving and Relapse,9286017,R01DA043690,"['Abstinence', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cannabis', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Users', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Cues', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug usage', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gambling', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychotherapy', 'Publishing', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'cognitive training', 'craving', 'cue reactivity', 'density', 'design', 'drug craving', 'drug relapse', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'movie', 'neural correlate', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'success']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,450712,0.047574872683283
"Functional regression framework with applications to drug response prediction Drug sensitivity prediction for individual patients is a significant challenge for precision medicine. Current modeling approaches consider prediction of a single feature of the drug response curve such as Area Under the Curve or IC50. However, the single feature summary of the dose response curve does not provide the entire drug sensitivity profile as some features vary systematically with cell lines while others with drugs. The overall goal of this proposal is to design a mathematical and computational framework for dose response curve prediction based on target response curves and genetic characterizations. For individual patients, the problem is formulated as functional prediction from functional predictors. The functional predictors refer to the dose response of specific targets inhibited by the drug that can be obtained from chemical databases and drug kinase activity studies. To achieve our goal, we propose three specific aims: In Aim 1, we will design a Bayesian framework for estimating the significant drivers of a disease along with the design of a model for single and combination drug response prediction. In Aim 2, we will enhance the model by incorporating non-functional predictors in the form of genetic characterizations and develop a joint model to predict dose response curves with both genetic characteristics as well as target response curves as inputs. We propose to develop an efficient way of searching such extremely high dimensional predictor space. In Aim 3, we will develop a hybrid prediction mechanism that combines inferentially motivated model-based techniques and computationally efficient machine learning techniques to improve predictions as well as obtain significant predictors simultaneously. The proposed framework is appropriate for modeling and analyzing cellular response to single or combination of perturbation agents and the successful completion of the aims will allow us to design personalized therapy along with increased understanding of functional response of cells to external perturbations. The proposal considers the design of a novel framework for drug response curve prediction based on drug target profiles and genetic characterizations. The successful implementation of the innovation will have broad societal benefit as it involves facilitating precision medicine with the objective of improved outcomes.",Functional regression framework with applications to drug response prediction,9323474,R01GM122084,"['Area Under Curve', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Modeling', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Techniques', 'base', 'computer framework', 'design', 'drug sensitivity', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'response']",NIGMS,TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,213915,0.06268484918916983
"Biocomputation across distributed private datasets to enhance drug discovery Project Summary Collaborative Drug Discovery (CDD) proposes to develop technology that will vastly simplify and integrate all the processes required to exploit predictive models for drug discovery. The software will make it easy for scientists without specialized training in informatics to create, train, apply, evaluate, share, and archive models with minimal effort, and also leverage a large library of pre-computed models with zero effort. The software will also enable scientists working in different organizations to collectively build models from their aggregated data and share these models, without sharing the underlying training data.  Our goal is to democratize the role in drug discovery of computational models – which have historically been restricted to computational experts – and allow models to become routine aids to the discovery workflow in academia, foundations, government laboratories, and small companies that do not have the resources to employ them today. In Phase 2 we implemented modified Bayesian model building directly within CDD’s web- based CDD Vault platform, which securely hosts structure-activity relationship (SAR) data; any user can now easily train a Bayesian model with experimental data stored in her private Vault, then apply the model to predict activity for untested compounds. In Phase 2B we propose to generalize this capability with the following new Specific Aims, which are needed to achieve a widespread scientific and commercial impact: Aim 1: Integrate a suite of diverse computational techniques (such as QSAR, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, and possibly others) into a single framework, to allow direct side-by-side comparison. Aim 2: Develop and validate a universal metric that ranks the predictive strength of each method as applied to a particular dataset. Aim 3: Apply the metric to automatically generate thousands of models from high-quality, public-access structure-activity and ADME/Tox datasets and present key results to the user. Aim 4: Develop a novel capability to build models collaboratively, by aggregating multiple datasets, and share the models without revealing the compounds and data in the training sets. Project Narrative The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to accelerate the discovery of new and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. These tools will particularly benefit researchers working on diseases that leading pharmaceutical companies have largely ignored because they are not perceived as highly profitable opportunities, despite the fact that in many cases they afflict millions of people.",Biocomputation across distributed private datasets to enhance drug discovery,9345057,R44TR000942,"['Academia', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Update', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'forest', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'model building', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2017,750457,0.04842976366917423
"A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis PROJECT SUMMARY This project will address the critical need for new and effective antitubercular drugs. Our primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis tolerates antitubercular drug treatment. Our motivating hypothesis is that M. tuberculosis tolerates drug induced stress by differentially regulating detoxification enzymes, efflux pumps, metabolic activity, pellicle-forming factors, and cell wall remodeling systems. Further, we postulate that a secondary drug targeting one or few regulators of these tolerance strategies will potentiate the primary drug-treatment, and potentially reduce the emergence of resistance. We propose a systems biology approach to generate a network perspective of drug-induced tolerance mechanisms and how they are coordinated by one or few regulators that could be targeted for overcoming drug-specific tolerance using combinatorial treatment regimens. Hence, the innovation of our proposed research emerges from integrating network characterization of drug- specific tolerance mechanisms into the rational discovery of novel drug combinations. In Aim 1, we will transcriptionally profile M. tuberculosis following treatment with ten selected drugs (primary drugs). Using techniques developed in our laboratory, differentially expressed genes will be mapped onto a systems-scale gene regulatory network model of M. tuberculosis to infer drug-specific tolerance sub-networks and elucidate key regulators. We will also identify tolerance sub-networks by generating genome-wide fitness profiles in the presence of the selected primary drugs. Drug-associated fitness defects will reveal genes that are important for dealing with drug-induced stress and are hypothesized to cluster together in drug-specific tolerance sub-networks. In Aim 2, we will transcriptionally profile ~250 secondary drugs and perform combination high-throughput screens of all primary and secondary drug combinations. Data from these studies will be used to iteratively refine the model and develop a machine learning algorithm to identify gene- and network-level features that are predictive of synergistic drug interactions. Finally, mechanism of synergistic drug combinations will be characterized by selectively perturbing the predicted regulators of the tolerance sub-networks. This project will propel the development of systems biology tools to accurately predict novel synergistic drug combinations, thereby guiding experimental assessment and accelerating the delivery of new treatments to patients with tuberculosis infection. PROJECT NARRATIVE Treatment of tuberculosis infection (responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually) is complicated by the impermeable cell wall structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its intrinsic ability to adapt and withstand drug treatment, a phenomenon called tolerance. Thus, an urgent goal of antitubercular drug discovery is to overcome drug tolerance. This project will deepen our understanding of how M. tuberculosis responds to and thereby tolerates drug treatment and will use this systems-scale understanding to develop a predictive framework for identifying new synergistically acting drug combinations for the treatment of tuberculosis.",A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9220609,R01AI128215,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antitubercular Agents', 'Cell Wall', 'Cessation of life', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Enzymes', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'combinatorial', 'differential expression', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'fitness', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'response', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2017,871572,0.14216128145974083
"Mechanisms Underlying Differential Effects of Neighborhood Poverty on Problematic Adolescent Drug Use PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Where a child grows up can inﬂuence his or her risk of problematic drug use. Surprisingly, policies and programs designed to improve neighborhood conditions have yielded conﬂicting results in which some children beneﬁt but others are harmed. Understanding the mechanisms by which neighborhoods act to affect problem- atic drug use and how these mechanisms differ across subgroups and cities—that is, understanding where and for whom mechanisms apply—is essential to optimize the effectiveness of future neighborhood interventions. Mechanisms involving mediation by aspects of the school environment have been unexamined, but could prove promising for understanding differential effects of neighborhood on problematic drug use. The objective of this K99/R00 is to identify school-based mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use and to develop statistical methods to understand how mediation effects differ across subgroup and place. This objective contributes to the long-term goal of improving the effectiveness of interven- tions to prevent drug abuse and dependence by tailoring interventions to address the most relevant mechanisms of action for each target population based on place and individual-level characteristics. The K99 phase ﬁlls the following training gaps that are critical to achieving the research objective and long-term goal: 1) methodologic training in causal mediation analysis; 2) subject-matter training in drug abuse and dependence prevention in ur- ban populations; and 3) involvement in real-world school-based interventions to develop methods with practical utility. Aim 1 of the proposed research identiﬁes the school environment mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and adolescent problematic drug use and modiﬁers of those mechanisms. Aim 2 extends a statistical method recently developed by the proposed research team for generalizing intervention ef- fects from one city to another to generalizing mediation effects. Finally, Aim 3 uses the method developed in Aim 2 to identify how the school environment mechanisms mediating neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use differ across major U.S. cities. The proposed research is expected to identify school-based mechanisms underly- ing differential effects of neighborhood poverty on adolescent problematic drug use by subgroup and place using the only study of randomized neighborhood residence. In addition, it is expected to contribute a novel statistical method that incorporates cutting-edge machine learning techniques to identify which mediation mechanisms can generalize across place, advancing translational research. Successful interventions are assumed to work in differ- ent settings, but that is not the case in practice. The proposed research will allow us to predict intervention effects while accounting for differences in population composition and modiﬁers of the mediation mechanism. This will make a signiﬁcant contribution to improving health by informing the design and targeting of future neighborhood interventions to adolescents and places that may be most impacted in terms of problematic drug use prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is to expected to advance understanding of how two important contexts—neighborhood and school—act together to inﬂuence problematic drug use among adolescents, including how these mechanisms differ across adolescent subgroups and places. In addition, the proposed research will result in the development of a ﬂexible statistical method to predict intervention mechanism effects in new target populations, taking into account population composition. Together, these contributions are anticipated to optimize targeting of future interventions to prevent drug abuse and addiction.",Mechanisms Underlying Differential Effects of Neighborhood Poverty on Problematic Adolescent Drug Use,9312260,K99DA042127,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Development', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home visitation', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Schools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tweens', 'Work', 'adolescent drug use', 'base', 'boys', 'bullying', 'career', 'cost', 'design', 'drug abuse prevention', 'flexibility', 'girls', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'method development', 'novel', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'residence', 'successful intervention']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K99,2017,153238,0.045153996839221465
"DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are dangerous and expensive, afflicting about 1.5% of hospitalized patients with profound health and financial consequences. In Medicare patients alone, adverse drug reactions account for 19% of total spending ($339 billion), more than 1,900 deaths, and more than 77,000 extra hospital days per year. Idiosyncratic ADRs, especially rare and severe hypersensitivity-driven ADRs, are the leading cause of medicine withdrawal and termination of clinical development. At the same time, a large proportion of drugs are not associated with hypersensitivity driven ADRs, offering hope that new medicines could avoid them entirely with reliable predictors of risk. Hypersensitivity driven ADRs are caused by the formation of chemically reactive metabolites by metabolic enzymes. These reactive metabolites covalently attach to proteins to become immunogenic and provoke an ADR. Unfortunately, current computational and experimental approaches do not reliably identify drug candidates that form reactive metabolites. These approaches are limited because they inadequately model metabolism, which can both render toxic molecules safe and safe molecules toxic. To overcome this limitation, the proposed study aims to curate a public database of metabolism and reactivity and use this database to build accurate and validated mathematical models of metabolism and reactivity. The models will be constructed using machine-learning algorithms that quantitatively summarize the knowledge from thousands of published studies. The Aims are to (1) curate a database of metabolism and build models that identify rules governing the structure of reaction products during drug metabolism in the liver, (2) curate a database of reactivity and build improved reactivity models that mechanistically predict which metabolites are reactive with biological molecules, and (3) curate a database of reactive metabolites and combine these models to predict when molecules form reactive metabolites that covalently bind proteins. The computational models generated by these Aims will be validated through statistical approaches and against bench-top experiments. Taken together, this approach will substantially improve on existing approaches by more accurately modeling the properties determining whether metabolism renders drugs toxic or safe. The predictive models will make new medicines safer by helping researchers avoid molecules prone to ADRs without harming patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse drug reactions, especially rare but severe hypersensitivity-driven reactions, have profound financial and health implications and are caused by reactive drug metabolites. As an extension of tools and data developed by our groups, we will build and test mathematical models and datasets that more accurately predict when molecules form clinically important reactive metabolites than current methodologies, such as “structural alerts.” We will use these models to build a tool that will better predict when drug candidates form reactive metabolites, which will make new medicines safer by enabling researchers to avoid drug candidates prone to causing adverse reactions.",DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY,9265938,R01LM012222,"['Adverse reactions', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Activation', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Relative Risks', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Stevens-Johnson Syndrome', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'Withdrawal', 'adduct', 'clinical development', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug metabolism', 'drug withdrawal', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'liver metabolism', 'macromolecule', 'mathematical model', 'model building', 'novel', 'online repository', 'predictive modeling', 'protein function', 'quantum', 'repository', 'screening', 'tool']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,374026,0.050695012992965666
"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Summary The objective of ‘Assay Central’ is to compile a comprehensive collection of datasets for structure-activity data for a broad variety of disease targets and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicology (ADMET) properties, in a form that is immediately ready for model building and other forms of analysis using cheminformatics methods. This is aided by the existence of many sources of curated open data, and one in particular, ChEMBL 1, 2 will be used as the nucleus in Phase I. This bioassay data collection is incredibly valuable, but not currently provided in a form that is ready-to-go for use by small research and development (R&D) organisations that do not have their own in-house cheminformatics teams. The effort required to preprocess, filter, merge, validate and normalize the structure and activity data requires a great deal of software expertise and medicinal chemistry domain knowledge, which are key skillsets that are rare and expensive to combine within the same team. Create a script to analyze the databases like ChEMBL, selected parts of PubChem and others 1, 2 and partition it into groups of compatible activity measurements against the same target. We will seed the dataset collection with a set of 1840 target-assay groups that have been recently extracted from the ChEMBL v20 database, as well as EPA Tox21 measurements 3, using methodology that we have already developed (similar to that described in 4). We will build error checking and correction software. We will apply best-of-breed methodology for checking and correcting structure-activity data 5 which errs on the side of caution for problems with non- obvious solutions, so that we can manually identify problems and either apply patches, or datasource-specific automated corrections. We will build and validate Bayesian models with the datasets collected and cleaned. For each of the target-activity groups, we will create a Bayesian model using ECFP6 or FCFP6 fingerprints, and this will be one of the primary outputs from the project. Models will be evaluated using internal and external testing with receiver operator characteristic (ROC > 0.75), the integral of the true-negative-rate – true-positive-rate curve as well as the enrichment,6 Kappa value and positive predicted value.7 We will develop new data visualization tools as a proof of concept in phase I. We have already begun to explore preliminary visualization methods using multiple models, but these have so far focused primarily on a handful of machine learning models selected from a very large list. New visualization techniques are required to summarize large matrices of data, e.g. a list of proposed structures vs. thousands of target models. In Phase II we will expand by upgrading to newer ChEMBL releases, selectively incorporating screening runs from other databases (such as PubChem 8), These tools will consist of software created explicitly for this project (particularly web-based interfaces), as well as enhanced functionality added to 3rd party tools that we influence (e.g. mobile apps) and open source projects that we have already contributed to (e.g. CDK for fingerprints and Bayesian modelling). We will widely publicise Assay Central at conferences and in papers. Being able to use transparent computational models simultaneously for visualizing activity trends for multiple targets (both diseases and ADMET) removes the burden of curation or purchasing and maintaining expensive software, and drastically simplifies the addition of new data. It also represents a new frontier of drug discovery as a world of small, agile distributed R&D organizations has access to valuable public datasets that can inform their research. Such computational models will assist in drug repurposing efforts internally and with our collaborators while likely identifying new compounds for a wide array of drug discovery projects. Narrative There are massive publically accessible databases that include a broad variety of disease targets and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicology (ADMET) properties that are not a form that is immediately ready for machine learning model building. The ‘Assay Central’ project will compile a comprehensive collection of these datasets (from PubChem and ChEMBL) for structure-activity data. This will enable the user to quickly and automatically use machine learning models for various targets and properties. The approach will also have high value for drug repurposing efforts and identifying new compounds for targets with creation of new IP in our own research on neglected and rare diseases and in the laboratories of customers.",Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations,9254390,R43GM122196,"['Attention', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Collection', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Excretory function', 'Fingerprint', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Side', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toxicology', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'absorption', 'cheminformatics', 'data visualization', 'drug discovery', 'frontier', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mobile application', 'model building', 'neglect', 'open data', 'open source', 'research and development', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend', 'web based interface', 'web interface']",NIGMS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2017,149999,0.03175513605308143
"Text Mining for High-fidelity Curation and Discovery of Gene-drug-phenotype Relationships ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rate at which new drugs are being introduced to market is decreasing, with grave implications for human health. Knowledge about the molecular mechanisms relevant to drug response is critical, but is collected in myriad individual experiments. As a result, the published literature contains rich information about how drugs and genes/gene products interact to produce phenotypes at the molecular, cellular and organismal levels, but this textual data requires substantial additional processing. As a result, there are efforts to manually curate the literature, and extract relationships between three key entities: genes/gene products, drugs and phenotypes-with the goal of representing the information in structured, computable formats. Although automated text mining may ultimately replace expert human curators, its best current role is to triage the literature and bring potentially important information to the attention of human curators. Recent advances in computational natural language processing (NLP) generally, and within our laboratory specifically, offer an opportunity to extract relationships between key entities with high accuracy. In particular, we have prototyped methods that take a relatively small set of examples of a relationship of interest (e.g. examples of gene-drug pairs in which the gene product metabolizes the drug) and then and other pairs that share a similar relationship. These methods can be applied to any relationship between our three key entity types. Thus, we propose an ambitious plan to (1) gather large corpora of biomedical text and extend existing lexicons for these entities, (2) build a database of all sentences/paragraphs relating these entities to one another, (3) create methods for accurately extracting semantically precise relationships from all pairs of entity types, and (4) validate these extracted relationships using both available gold standard data experimental sources and expert curator evaluation. In addition to directly supporting curation, our methods and extractions will be made available as general purpose resources for understanding drug action. Project Narrative Published biological text contains an abundance of valuable information about how drugs work at the molecular, cellular and organism levels and how they affect patients. However, it is difﬁcult to gather all relevant information to support discovery of new drugs and optimal use of existing drugs. This proposal outlines a plan to develop methods for extracting drug-related information from huge collections of text, and using it to improve drug discovery and use.",Text Mining for High-fidelity Curation and Discovery of Gene-drug-phenotype Relationships,9306199,R01LM005652,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Dependency', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Triage', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'gene discovery', 'gene product', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'novel therapeutics', 'prototype', 'response', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,331290,0.040331409155760146
"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,9370683,P50AR070590,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Custom', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Ohio', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Provider', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'Records', 'Records Controls', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Model', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'design', 'differential expression', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'synergism', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIAMS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,P50,2017,1276741,0.03608675108615172
"Omics data integration and analysis for structure-based multi-target drug design Abstract Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), whole genome sequencing, and high-throughput techniques have generated vast amounts of diverse omics and phenotypic data. However, these sets of data have not yet been fully explored to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery, which continues along the one- drug-one-gene paradigm. Consequently, the cost of bringing a drug to market is staggering, and the failure rate is daunting. Our long-term goal is to revive the lagging pharmaceutical pipeline by identifying robust methods for achieving precision medicine. We will achieve this goal by developing a novel structural systems pharmacology approach to drug discovery, which integrates structure-based drug design with heterogeneous omics data integration and analysis in the context of the whole human and pathogen genome and interactome. An increasing body of evidence from both our group and others suggests that most drugs commonly interact with multiple receptors (targets). Both strong and weak multiple drug-target interactions can collectively mediate drug efficacy, toxicity, and resistance through the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. In order to rationally design potent, safe, and precision medicine, we face one of the major unsolved challenges in structure-based drug design: what are all the possible proteins and their conformational states interacting with a drug in an organism? This proposal attempts to address this challenge by developing, disseminating, and experimentally testing novel computational tools. Based on our successful preliminary results, we will develop an integrated computational pipeline to identify three-dimensional (3D) protein-chemical interaction models in the cellular context and on a structural proteome scale. Specifically, we will develop a quaternary structure- centric multi-layered network model by integrating heterogeneous data from genomics, proteomics, and phenomics. We will develop a novel collaborative one-class collaborative filtering algorithm to infer missing relations in the multi-layered network. We will combine tools derived from structural bioinformatics, biophysics, and machine learning to gain biological insights into the drug action. To facilitate the usability and reproducibility of the proposed algorithms, we will develop community-based web resources established by our previous experiences in developing the Protein Data Bank (PDB). More importantly, we will work closely with experimental laboratories to test the proposed computational tools using targeted kinase polypharmacology as a real-world example, and iteratively improve the performance and usability of algorithm, software, and web services. The successful completion of this project will provide the scientific community with: (1) new methods to enhance the scope and capability of high-throughput screening for structure-based multi-target drug design; (2) a user-friendly web service to support community-based drug discovery; and (3) potential novel anti-cancer targeted therapeutics. Together, these tools will advance drug discovery and precision medicine by providing a structural systems pharmacology toolkit. Relevance Statement The pharmaceutical industry is in a dire state. Both the cost to launch a new drug and the attrition rate are increasing.

"The HMS Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology PROJECT SUMMARY  Systems and computational biologists, physician-scientists, pharmacologists, biochemists and cell biologists will collaborate in a new Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP) to apply a measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. The LSP will pioneer the development of quantitative network-centric approaches to pharmacology and toxicology that include analysis of dose-time-response relationships at a single-cell level, modeling of cellular network dynamics and their perturbation by drugs, development of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models in mouse and ultimately in man and use of systematic approaches to identify and qualify new drug targets. Our approach combines mathematical modeling with empirical measurement (including work with clinical samples and data) and aims to create quantitative and predictive drug response models at different temporal and physical scales. We aim to reinvigorate pharmacology and toxicology as foundational disciplines of translational medicine, develop the conceptual underpinning for personalized and precision medicine and lower the cost of drug discovery by improving its predictability. Close interactions with industry and the FDA will help address the productivity gap in drug discovery and development. The LSP is innovative with respect to its goal of using problems in basic and translational pharmacology to link three disciplines (cell and molecular biology, computational biology and medicine) and its aim of advancing therapeutic science in the Boston area and beyond. Students and postdocs supervised by 18 faculty members, 2 independent postdoctoral fellows and two PhD-level staff from 7 institutions will work in immediate proximity in a new custom-designed laboratory. The lab will host a new graduate program in therapeutics and multi-factored outreach activities that will promote systems pharmacology internationally.  These goals will be achieved through four inter-linked research programs (Aims 1-4), a core dedicated to efficient translation of LSP research (Aim 5), an education core and administrative/outreach activities (Aims 6-8). Aim 1 will focus on the determinants of dose-response at a single-cell level, including the role of cell-to-cell variability in fractional response and of timing and order-of-exposure in combination therapy. Aim 2 will take a network-level approach to understanding therapeutic, toxic and paradoxical drug responses by kinase inhibitors in three types of cancer. The mechanistic basis and consequences of poly-pharmacology will also be examined along with differential drug responsiveness by normal and diseased tissues. Aim 3 will address PK-PD by developing multi-scale models of drug actions at the level of cells, tissues and organisms and new methods for measuring drug distribution at the cellular and subcellular levels. Aim 4 will apply machine learning and causal reasoning to target discovery from clinical records in asthma, inflammatory disease and fibrosis and pursue a structure-guided approach to identifying regulators of ""undruggable "" targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The computational biologists, physician-scientists and pharmacologists in the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology will apply a combined measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. They will develop and apply new tools to (i) investigate the factors that determine the therapeutic index of drugs at a single cell level and in tissues (ii) apply knowledge of cellulr networks to develop a rational approach to combination therapy (iii) identify and qualify new drug targets for significant unmet medical needs.

"Doctor Shopping for Controlled Substances: Insights from Two-Mode Social Network Analysis The proposed project will analyze patterns of doctor shopping for prescription opioids and benzodiazepines using two-mode (i.e. affiliation) social network analysis (SNA). Abuse of prescription opioids and benzodiazepines in the U.S. has risen rapidly, creating a public health crisis. Mortality from drug overdose is higher than motor vehicle accidents and is among the nation's leading preventable causes of death. Doctor shopping is defined as obtaining controlled substances from multiple health care practitioners simultaneously, exceeding the recommended dosage. Doctor shopping is a principle method of obtaining controlled substances for misuse, and an indicator of escalating drug abuse that is associated with a two-fold risk for fatal overdose. Lack of consensus about criteria for classifying doctor shopping has led to wide variation in estimated rates of questionable prescribing activity. This ambiguity poses barriers to understanding factors underlying doctor shopping, and impedes the evaluation of prescription drug policies. Currently, numerical thresholds or multiple provider episodes (MPEs; i.e. overlapping prescriptions) are most often used to identify doctor shoppers, resulting in false positives and negatives. A goal of the proposed study is to determine whether incorporating information about actors' structural position in a two-mode social network of patients and prescribers can produce more valid indictors of illicit behavior. Two-mode network analysis focuses on ties between two different classes or sets of entities. In the proposed project, data form a two-mode network with prescribers in one class and patients in the other, and ties are present only between prescribers and patients. Two-mode SNA is ideal for examining structural patterns in social interaction between two sets of actors, and for determining the most active and central actors in a network. Consistently targeting prescribers that are key players in prescription drug networks may be indicative of strategic doctor shopping behavior or information sharing among patients. Insights from SNA will be used to fine-tune doctor-shopping indicators, improving our ability to detect early signs of abuse, as well as behavior that is intermittent, ambiguous, or less intense, but still problematic. The specific aims of the proposed study are to: 1) Utilize SNA to develop and assess network- based metrics of doctor shopping in comparison to traditional indicators; and 2) Identify characteristics of doctor shopping patients, targeted prescribers, and the point of service. To our knowledge, this is the first study of prescription drug abuse to use two-mode SNA as its methodological approach. This study is significant in applying two-mode SNA – a complex, systems science methodology – to drug abuse research and has the potential to facilitate cost-effective information extraction from extant datasets for translation to policy and practice. The long-term goal of this research is to leverage insights from SNA to improve detection and prevention of doctor shopping and related fraudulent activities, and ultimately reduce the prevalence and public health impact of prescription drug abuse. Abuse of prescription opioids and benzodiazepines has reached epidemic status, and is currently among the nation’s leading preventable causes of death. The proposed research examines social network ties between patients and their prescribing clinicians in a large insurance claims database to identify patterns of prescription seeking that indicate fraudulent activity (e.g. doctor shopping) and possible information sharing among patients who abuse prescription drugs. The goals of this research are to improve detection of early, intermittent, and ambiguous signs of prescription drug abuse behaviors, and to better understand characteristics of patients who engage in doctor shopping and the clinicians they target.",Doctor Shopping for Controlled Substances: Insights from Two-Mode Social Network Analysis,9321366,R01DA039928,"['Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug abuse', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Imagery', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Services', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Solo Practices', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Translations', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'cost effective', 'dosage', 'drug seeking behavior', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'operation', 'prescription drug abuse', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid abuse', 'programs', 'response', 'standard measure', 'substance misuse', 'trend', 'vehicular accident']",NIDA,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2017,287893,0.023229045671444765
"A Quantitative Systems Pharmacology Software Platform for Biologics: reduce costs and accelerate development of innovative biotherapeutics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Drug development is a very lengthy and expensive undertaking. Failure rate for novel drugs exceeds 95%. Therefore, successful drugs must cover the costs of these failures. As such, prescription drug prices have escalated at an alarming rate and show no signs of stopping. The need for successful drugs to cover failures also means that pharmaceutical companies primarily devote resources to pursuing drug candidates that have a large enough population to allow the company to earn a return on its investment. Thus, diseases that affect only a small portion of the populace are not investigated nearly as much as, say, oncology, cardiovascular or immunology. Current practice usually involves taking modeling techniques developed for small molecule research and trying to adapt them to biologics. However, this approach, more often than not, does not provide the scientist with predictions around feasibility and optimal drug properties, resulting in wasted effort pursuing leads that have no chance of making it through clinical trials, or to be reimbursed by payors. Applied BioMath has developed tools that address high value questions in the middle of the drug development pipeline. By coupling quantitative systems pharmacology techniques with high performance computing and sophisticated mathematical algorithms, we have proven an ability to predict optimal drug properties years before entering the clinic. For the past two years we have been offering our services to pharma and biotechs alike, to rave reviews. We have also been approached with inquiries to license our software. This project will fund the development of our proprietary algorithms and toolsets into a stable, standardized software platform, that can be automatically validated for GLP, for by biologics to develop their internal systems pharmacology models. At its heart, our toolsets are built on Kronecker Bio, an open source biophysical computational engine co­developed by one of our Founders while pursuing his PhD in Biological Engineering with the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This robust platform is currently in use, in its raw form, in the pharmaceutical industry but is limited in its adoption due to its lack of usability, quality contro and GLP validation. This project will focus on the application and presentation layer, allowing the underlying computational functionality to be easily accessed, utilized and understood, so capital requirements are less than a typical software development project. Achieving our goal of building this software platform is only the first step. What follows is a concerted push into the biologics segment, which we are currently seeding through our services offering and gaining a reputation as a firm that delivers high value on time. We have completed our second round of fundraising, raising a total of $1.8m between both rounds. This grant, plus the additional fundraising, will ensure that we are able to roll out our tools and assist drug companies in delivering best­in­class biologics, that meet unmet medical need, on an accelerated timeline to provide patients with a better quality of life. Better, faster, cheaper drugs... truly a win­win­in. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  To reduce the cost of drugs, identify fast failures, and accelerate the rollout of best­in­class biotherapeutics, analyses in the middle of the drug development pipeline, from LI to early clinical trials, based on mechanisms and biophysics, is needed. There are currently a number of open source tools that provide systems pharmacology models for use in research. However, a lack of a standardized and automated GLP validation scheme prevents the models from continuing through to development. A robust, systems pharmacology software platform, widely utilized by drug companies and upon which fit for purpose systems pharmacology models can be built, will greatly reduce the time required to get a drug to market, enable the development of best in class drugs, increase safety for patients and significantly reduce the development costs associated with biologics. We have developed proprietary mechanistic algorithms that we currently use to analyze assays and drug program data for our customers. These algorithms are naturally grouped into certain functions/toolsets. These tools are applicable, depending on what questions are being investigated, across most/all therapeutics areas. While our toolsets (InVitro Analyzer, Biologic Feasibility, Biologic Optimizer, Biologic PKPD, Biologic Mechanistic Covariants) are currently in alpha stage (being used to create fit for purpose models for our clients), they are being used in industry to fulfill our servces contracts. We are looking to create an industry standard platform, leveraging our proprietary algorithms and toolsets, that will allow drug scientists to create fit for purpose models that can be easily validated for GLP use in IND applications. We have sampled the market and estimated a potential target audience of over 100,000 users, worldwide. We arrived at this number by; reviewing the Top 100 Pharma companies by revenue, determining employee count from those companies' annual reports, using our Founders knowledge of select large and small pharma and biotechs and its employee count and number of employees that could use our software, segmenting the list into groups based on revenue, extrapolating on a percent basis each company's applicable target audience, assumed companies outside the Top 100 had one quarter (25%) of the applicable audience as the 100th largest company and then summed these estimates. This produced a number of over 100,000 potential customers. For validation, we determined that the number of people, globally, employed in the pharmaceutical industry is 4,500,000 (2012, www.statista.com). So our target market is less than 3% of total pharma employees and our business model shows market penetration of just over 5% of our target market by 2020, or less than 0.15% of total pharmaceutical employees.",A Quantitative Systems Pharmacology Software Platform for Biologics: reduce costs and accelerate development of innovative biotherapeutics,9266447,R44GM116214,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Annual Reports', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biophysics', 'Biotechnology', 'Businesses', 'Capital', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cloud Computing', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Contracts', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Utilization', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Employee', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Immunology', 'Industry', 'Industry Standard', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Massachusetts', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Price', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TNF gene', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'absorption', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'computer science', 'cost', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'mathematical algorithm', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical development', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability', 'working group']",NIGMS,"APPLIED BIOMATH, LLC",R44,2017,1016648,0.10111973938678041
"The Interdependency of Drug Resistance Evolution and Drug Design: HIV-1 Protease DESCRIPTION: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies. The pressures of evolution will likely result in a variety of pathways for resistance to evolve. Drug resistance can be caused by a change in the balance of molecular recognition events that selectively weakens inhibitor binding but maintains the biological function of the therapeutic target. To reduce the likelihood of drug resistance, the interdependency of the target's function within the context of the biological system in which it exists must be elucidated. Disrupting the therapeutic target's activity is necessary but not sufficient for avoiding resistance. In this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that key pathways and coupled mechanisms confer drug resistance to therapeutic targets. We seek to define the sequence, structural and dynamic, and temporal evolutionary constraints of the interdependency of drug resistance: 1) to recognize the pathways by which resistance occurs and 2) to devise drug design strategies for developing a drug that is robust against resistance. HIV-1 Protease is the perfect case study! HIV evolves very quickly with on average a point mutation introduced in every third genome replicated. HIV protease inhibitors have the potential of being both very potent and robust to resistance. Protease inhibitors are the only HIV inhibitor class that are transition state analogs and can be evolutionarily constrained within the substrate envelope. Inhibitors that leverage both of these characteristics, such as Darunavir (DRV) and similar analogs, have the potential of being robust, nearly resistance proof inhibitors, to drug- naïve HIV infected patients. If HIV achieves resistance to these inhibitors it is only through complex pathways and combinations of mutations. Further elucidating these complex pathways will bring us closer to resistance-proof inhibitors. In this project our team will use and develop cutting-edge technology to follow the pathways of drug resistance selection, to elucidate the molecular basis for their interdependent patterns and incorporate these mechanisms into drug design strategies. Together we will make inroads into tackling drug resistance that would be impossible for any of us to individually achieve PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies.

"Utilization of Phenotypic Precision Medicine to Identify Optimal Drug Combinations for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma PROJECT SUMMARY  The authors have developed a computational platform to rapidly identify optimal drug and dose combinations from the innumerable possibilities. By testing this technique termed Phenotypic Personalized Medicine (PPM) in a diverse number of experimental systems representing different diseases, they have found that the response of biological systems to drugs can be described by a low order, smooth multidimensional surface. The main consequence of this is that optimal drug combinations can be found in a small number of tests and that translation from in vitro to in vivo and ultimately to clinical application is enabled through a re- optimization process. This input–output relationship that is always based on experimental data in lieu of predicted responses may also lead to a straightforward solution for handling human diversity in cancer therapeutics, among other diseases. In these series of studies they will test the hypothesis that PPM can be developed and validated for clinical use by using it to find novel drug combinations of repurposed/repositioned drugs to treat hepatocellular carcinoma. The goal is that by the end of year 3 of this project, they will be able to initiate a clinical trial using these novel combination or combinations.  This group has previously used PPM-based optimization to find novel drug combinations in in vitro and in vivo models of cancer and infection. They have shown that this approach was able to markedly improve the efficacy of colorectal cancer therapy in vivo in mouse models. Translationally in a first-in-human clinical trial, they recently completed a prospective clinical study involving 4 PPM-dosed patients and 4 control (standard of care dosed) patients. They calculated the tacrolimus dosing regimen using the PPM process. Because PPM does not require a priori knowledge of disease mechanism and because it is a dynamic process that can accommodate a changing system, it can efficiently find personalized drug dosing over a varying range of time, having a profound stabilizing effect on the tacrolimus trough levels.  For this application, they have selected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, liver cancer) to be the human disease for PPM application. The key rationale for this clinical selection is that they have a wealth of in vitro data on HCC, an active HCC tumor biorepository, and a large clinical volume of patients with HCC. These existing resources, both in vitro and clinical, allow for the immediate exploration of combination discovery followed by a clinical validation of discovered combination candidates in patients with unresectable HCC. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project applies a computational platform (Phenotypic Precision Medicine) to optimize combination therapy for the treatment of liver cancer. Using empiric measurements of the responses to a given treatment regimen by liver cancer cell lines and mouse models, they will demonstrate a computational approach to finding and optimizing novel drug combinations using repurposed/repositioned drugs. First they will demonstrate the ability to devise novel combination therapies and then they will start planning for a clinical trial to test the feasibility and efficacy of this approach to the treatment of liver cancer.",Utilization of Phenotypic Precision Medicine to Identify Optimal Drug Combinations for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma,9386682,UH2TR002087,"['BAY 54-9085', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer cell line', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Regimen', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Unresectable', 'Validation', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'biobank', 'biological systems', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical application', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'hepatocellular carcinoma cell line', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'process optimization', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tumor']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,UH2,2017,286725,0.03633719193222451
"Computationally modeling the impact of ontogeny on drug metabolic fate   ABSTRACT Advancements in pediatric drug development require innovative approaches that overcome challenges in assessing age-dependent drug disposition and toxic risks related to metabolism. Cytochromes P450 dominate drug metabolism yet roles for individual enzymes depend on genetics, disease states, co-medications, and ontogeny. Failure to account for those differences contributes to dosing challenges and possibly toxicity as reported for dextromethorphan, midazolam, and phenytoin. The NICHD Pediatric Formulation Initiative (PFI) workshops emphasized the need for better modeling to describe and predict how drug metabolism changes for children. Current pharmacokinetic models predict how drug clearance changes with age that affect the optimal dose, but those models are limited in two ways; (1) they require experimentally determined kinetic data for several enzymes that is not often available, and (2) they do not model formation of specific drug metabolites, which is important in predicting toxicity and drug interactions, regardless of whether clearance changes with age. We hypothesize that computational models of mixtures of P450 enzymes can predict how the “metabolic fate”, i.e. the kinetics of drug metabolism and the resulting metabolite structures, of drugs changes with age. We propose building hierarchical mathematical models that at first predict the drug metabolites formed by metabolic enzymes (Aim 1), then the efficiency of formation for each metabolite (the kinetics) (Aim 2), and combine these models to predict metabolites formed by age-specific mixtures of P450s (Aim 3). This proposal makes significant steps toward achieving PFI goals. First, datasets created for this study will be made publicly available to foster model refinement and validation by the community. Second, simulation of metabolite profiles would yield tractable biomarkers and support studies on possible age-dependent drug-drug interactions, off- target biological activities, pro-drug activation, and formation of toxic species. Third, the models will indicate, for both new and existing drugs, when metabolic fate (consequently, toxicity and interactions) changes in pediatric patients, even when pharmacokinetics stay the same. Fourth, though not the primary aim of this study, successfully modeling metabolic efficiency could enable pharmacokinetic studies for predicting problematic pediatric drugs prior to carrying out any necessary experimental kinetic studies. Taken together, this proposal lays a strong foundation for developing models relevant that resolve challenges in optimizing drug dosages and minimizing toxicity risks for children.    PROJECT NARRATIVE The impact of age on cytochrome P450 metabolism makes drug disposition and toxic risks moving targets for pediatric patients, such that robust strategies to identify and assess ontogenetic (age-dependent) effects on drug metabolic fate (in vitro kinetics and metabolite structures) are clearly needed to better personalize drug development for pediatric dosing. As an extension of our prior work, we will build and test computational models and datasets for individual P450 isozymes that accurately predict drug metabolites and the rate (kinetics) at which they form. We will then combine these models for an effective, low cost approach that simulates hepatic P450 metabolism and takes into account age-dependent contributions from individual isozymes to assess the metabolic fate of drugs during child development.  ",Computationally modeling the impact of ontogeny on drug metabolic fate,9341387,R01LM012482,"['Access to Information', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Chemical Models', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dextromethorphan', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Educational workshop', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Failure', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hepatic', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Isoenzymes', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Microsomes', 'Midazolam', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacology and Toxicology', 'Phenytoin', 'Prodrugs', 'Property', 'Reaction', 'Recombinants', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxin', 'Validation', 'Work', 'absorption', 'age related', 'base', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'dosage', 'drug clearance', 'drug development', 'drug metabolism', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pediatric patients', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'repository', 'response', 'simulation', 'tool']",NLM,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2017,313125,0.10144328071766655
"High-throughput, all-optical assay in human cardiomyoctes for clinically relevant prediction of drug induced cardiotoxity. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Toxicity accounts for approximately 20% of drug attrition, of which nearly one third is attributed to cardiovascular issues, in particular arrhythmias.1 The cost of bringing a new drug to market can exceed $1.2 billion and require more than 10 years of research. Thus, it is critical to identify cardiotoxicity early in developmen. Current in vitro screening assays for pro-­‐arrhythmic drug effects focus on measuring inhibition of the hERG potassium channel, which has been linked to potentially lethal Torsades de Pointes arrhythmias (TdP).2 The hERG assay, however, lacks high sensitivity and specificity: not all QT prolongation is due to block of hERG alone and not all hERG blockers result in QT prolongation or induce TdP. To address these limitations, regulatory bodies have created the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) initiative2, which proposes use of cardiomyocytes derived from human stem cells as an in vitro model for arrhythmogenic drug potential. Establishment of this model for toxicity screening requires detailed characterization of the cardiomyocyte action potential (AP) and calcium transient (CT), the response of APs/CTs to drugs, and the correlation to clinical outcomes in humans. High-­‐throughput tools needed for performing these measurements, however, have been lacking. Here we propose to develop a high-­‐throughput, all-­‐optical electrophysiology platform for cardiotoxicity screening in sem cell-­‐derived cardiomyocytes. With our Phase I award, we demonstrated that the Optopatch platform could be used to detect changes in the electrophysiological characteristics of human derived CMs following both acute and chronic drug treatment, albeit with the throughput of a single well per recording. To highly parallelize these measurements, we propose building a 96-­‐well plate Optopatch instrument for simultaneous recording of voltage and calcium waveforms under paced conditions from 24 wells. This geometry will provide nearly two orders of magnitude improvement in throughput of our assay. Optopatch constructs will be optimized to allow for incorporation of the actuator and reporter proteins in each cell. We will utilize this platform to screen 50 compounds with known risk scores for Torsades de Pointes in different sources of human cardiomyocytes and use this data to develop a predictive algorithm of arrhythmogenicity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Q­‐State's technology will allow better prediction of a drug candidate's potential adverse effects to the human heart than the assays mandated by the current cardiac safety guidance ICH S7B.   It will contribute to bringing effective healthcare solutions to market at lower cost and higher productivity, by preventing drugs with cardiotoxicity from reaching the market and preventing the development of valuable therapeutics from being wrongly terminated, which is one of the concerns about the current S7B assays. Making Q-­‐State instrumentation and reagents available to the academic research community will facilitate better mechanistic studies and therapeutics development to benefit patients with cardiac conditions.","High-throughput, all-optical assay in human cardiomyoctes for clinically relevant prediction of drug induced cardiotoxity.",9247825,R44HL126314,"['Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Blinded', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Maturation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Ecology', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phototoxicity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Potassium Channel', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Torsades de Pointes', 'Toxic effect', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'human stem cells', 'in vitro Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'patch clamp', 'phase 1 study', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rate of change', 'response', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cell biology', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NHLBI,"Q-STATE BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2017,369580,0.08134887710930319
"Peripheral Nerve-on-a-chip for Predictive Preclinical Pharmaceutical Testing PROJECT SUMMARY The drug development pipeline is plagued by unacceptable rates of attrition due in large part to toxicities that are not identified in pre-clinical stages of development. The ability to de-risk lead compounds during pre-clinical development with advanced “organoid-on-a-chip” technologies shows tremendous promise. Drug-induced neurotoxicity is caused by off-target effects of pharmaceuticals that lead to sensory, motor, and cognitive deficits. While rarely fatal, drug-induced neurotoxicity can lead to permanent nerve damage and in some cases can be a dose-limiting side effect, leading patients to reduce dosage or stop treatment altogether. Although the peripheral nervous system bears the brunt of this neurological toxicity, development of microphysiological models of the peripheral nervous system is lagging. Towards that end, the technology described herein allows for 3D growth of high density axonal fiber tracts, resembling peripheral nerve anatomy. Progress during the prior award phase strongly demonstrated the feasibility of using microengineered neural tissues that are amenable to morphological and physiological measurements analogous to those of clinical tests. The use of structural and functional analyses should mean drug-induced neural toxicity will manifest in these measurements in ways that mimic clinical neuropathology. The goals of this proposal are to establish our human model using relevant physiological measurements in tissues fabricated from human iPS cells, and to validate the model system with a library of compounds, comparing against conventional cell culture models. Validating the peripheral nerve model system with drugs known to induce toxicity via a range of mechanisms will demonstrate the ability of the system to predict various classifications of neuropathy, yielding a high-content assay far more informative than traditional in vitro systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current methods available for bringing drugs to market have resulted in high attrition rates as compounds progress through the drug pipeline, resulting in unacceptable clinical trial toxicity and skyrocketing pharmaceutical prices. Improving the predictive power of preclinical models represents the fastest and most competitive method to advance the safety and time to market for new therapeutics. As an added benefit, decreased drug development costs should also expand the availability of novel treatment options for patients.",Peripheral Nerve-on-a-chip for Predictive Preclinical Pharmaceutical Testing,9410154,R42TR001270,"['Action Potentials', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Hydrogels', 'In Vitro', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Nerve', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neural Conduction', 'Neurites', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neuropathy', 'Organ', 'Organoids', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nerves', 'Peripheral Nervous System', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Preparation', 'Price', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Schwann Cells', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Speed', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'axon growth', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'density', 'dosage', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'expectation', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'motor deficit', 'neuropathology', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical development', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response']",NCATS,"AXOSIM, INC.",R42,2017,963541,0.059992043178360925
"Systems Pharmacological Analysis of Drug Efficacy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Project Summary/Abstract Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects more than 1 million Americans and has been increasing in prevalence in the last decade. IBD consists of two diseases, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which are both characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and can manifest with similar symptoms. Despite their similarities, the diseases are very heterogeneous and consist of complex interactions between the immune system, the microbiome, and the affected tissue. Characterizing the two diseases at the molecular level has been met with limited success, and the lack of a clear mechanistic pathway has resulted in the lack of efficacy of existing treatments in subsets of IBD patients. Previous methods have focused primarily on gene enrichment analysis, but these studies have shown inconsistent results and do not offer mechanistic insights into disease development. Systems pharmacological methods offer several advantages over traditional gene-based approaches by using networks to characterize relationships between genes, which enables the application of powerful analyses using graph theory. These methods enable us to use the topology of protein interaction networks to elucidate disease mechanisms and characterize network perturbations caused by drugs. Furthermore, with the advent of cheaper and more accurate modalities to quantify molecular profiles and the increasing availability of molecular data, we now have the ability to leverage multiple data sources to create a multifaceted approach to understanding the mechanism of IBD. Thus, by combining protein-protein interaction data, drug target data, and drug perturbation data, we aim to (1) construct personalized molecular networks for UC and CD, (2) develop a supervised network method to model drug effects, and (3) identify and validate novel drugs for treatment responders and nonresponders. With success, we will have the ability to distinguish treatment responders from nonresponders and have identified potential novel drug candidates to treat IBD. Furthermore, we will have a more thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of IBD, which will enable the development of more effective therapies to alleviate the suffering of millions worldwide. Project Narrative Inflammatory bowel disease affects over a million people in the United States, and many affected patients do not respond to current therapies. This proposal addresses this challenge by developing methods to discern patients unlikely to respond to these therapies and identifying novel therapeutic agents for drug responders and drug nonresponders.

"An integrative multi-phenotype pipeline for drug evaluation, pharmacogenomics, and attribute prediction PROJECT SUMMARY The process of drug discovery is costly and many promising compounds fail during clinical trials. By then, expenses upward of $500 million dollars per failed drug may have incurred and these financial risks hamper research efforts and – ultimately – reduce the availability of treatment options. In this research proposal we are using systematic approaches to map the relationships between drugs, genes, and phenotypes, i.e. the ability of a drug to elicit a certain molecular response in a cell with a specific gene mutation. These efforts aim at generating three important insights:  (1) By performing these mapping systematically across many drugs and many phenotypes we generate  phenotypic profiles that can aid in the classification of new compounds, enabling us to predict how well  these compounds may fare in later clinical stages, thus reducing cost and risk in drug development;  (2) By characterizing existing drugs more thoroughly, we can discover novel off-label usages for existing  drugs, thus expanding treatment options of FDA-approved compounds;  (3) By understanding gene-drug-phenotype relationships one-by-one we can assemble a complete picture  of drug-gene interactions, an important milestone in the development of personalized  pharmacogenomics that would allow patient-specific treatment planning. To accomplish these goals, we will employ a novel yeast-based phenotypic screening platform and use data- driven ontologies to understand the similarities between drugs in the phenotype-gene space. Overall, this work will move us closer to a comprehensive understanding of how phenotypes arise from the genome and how complex relationships between genes and drugs shape our medical treatment strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a drug-screening platform and database that will allow improved prediction of a drug's side-effects, mode-of-action, cross-reactivity and other important pharmacological attributes in the context of gene mutations. This system would reduce drug discovery cost, encourage rare disease research, and ultimately lead to personalized pharmacogenomics – the ability to select drugs and therapies based on the genetic makeup of individual patients to optimize treatment results.","An integrative multi-phenotype pipeline for drug evaluation, pharmacogenomics, and attribute prediction",9256264,R41TR001908,"['Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse effects', 'Alpha Cell', 'Animal Model', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'DNA Markers', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Modelings', 'Economics', 'FDA approved', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Microtubules', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutate', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Process', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxicology', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cell growth', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'experience', 'gene interaction', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic manipulation', 'genotoxicity', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'molecular modeling', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stable cell line', 'stem', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy']",NCATS,"PHENVOGEN, LLC",R41,2017,224991,0.1272161138796898
"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions. There is however, considerable interindividual variation in efficacy of statins for reducing disease risk, as well as in susceptibility to the most common adverse statin effects, myopathy and type 2 diabetes. The goal of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply complementary investigative approaches and multidisciplinary expertise for discovering and validating the genetic and metabolic factors responsible for this variability. This information has the potential for optimizig use of statins in clinical practice, and for identifying new pathways that underlie the diverse biologic actions of this drug class.              ",Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy,9326327,P50GM115318,"['Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Simvastatin', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'blood glucose regulation', 'candidate validation', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genotyped patients', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblast', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RES CTR AT OAKLAND,P50,2017,2688571,0.030219809588937847
"Mining health data for drug safety profiles DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical trials, which test the safety and efficacy of drugs in a controlled population, cannot identify all safety issues associated with drugs because the size and characteristics of the target population, duration of use, the concomitant disease conditions and therapies differ markedly in actual usage conditions.  On the outpatient side, medication related morbidity and mortality in the United States is estimated to result in 100,000 deaths and $177 billion in cost annually.  On the inpatient side, it is estimated that roughly 30% of hospital stays have an adverse drug event.  Current one-drug-at-a-time methods for surveillance are woefully inadequate because no one monitors the ""real life"" situation of patients getting over 3 concomitant drugs in the context of multiple co-morbidities.  In preliminary work, we have built an annotation and analysis pipeline that uses the knowledge-graph formed by public biomedical ontologies for the purpose data-mining unstructured clinical notes.  We have demonstrated that we can reproduce drug safety signals from the clinical notes on average 2.7 years ahead of the issue of a drug safety alert.  Using  this  pipeline, we  propose:  1)  to identfy and prioritize multi-drug  combinations that are worth testing; 2) to develop methods for discovering adverse event profiles of multi- drug  combinations; and  3)  to  create  an  EHR  derived  catalogue of potential adverse events of multi-drug combinations.  We will use hierarchies provided by existing public ontologies for drugs, diseases and side- effects to improve signal detection by aggregation, to reduce multiple hypothesis testing and to make a search for multi-drug side effects computationally tractable. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to combine data from electronic medical records, adverse event reports in AERS, and prior knowledge in curated knowledgebases to construct a data-driven safety profile for drugs.  Successful development of novel methods will result in significant cost savings as well as a significant increase in patient safety, given the current rat (~30%) of occurrence of adverse drug events.

"Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, having eclipsed motor vehicle-related deaths in 2008. A number of interventions have emerged in the last decade in response to this epidemic, including prescription drug monitoring programs; improving linkages to drug treatment; training drug users and those around them to recognize and respond appropriately to overdose; and, most recently, training and equipping law enforcement officers to use naloxone (an opioid antagonist) at the scene of an overdose. Equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone is intended to capitalize on the fact that officers often arrive at an overdose scene before other emergency services, particularly in rural areas, and until now have not been well equipped to deal with overdose events. In the last 5 years, with the active encouragement of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Department of Justice, law enforcement agencies in at least 28 states are planning to or have begun carrying naloxone to use when they attend overdoses. Despite the proliferation of such programs, this intervention is completely unstudied. In 2014 the San Diego Sheriff's Department began training patrol officers to use naloxone to respond to overdose prior to arrival of other emergency services, and to actively refer overdose victims to a collaborating drug treatment agency after revival. Uptake of drug treatment has been higher than expected (3 of 9 revivals in the 6 month pilot phase of the project entered treatment). We hypothesize that the moments after an overdose represent a ""teachable moment"" in which drug users may be more motivated to enter treatment. In addition, we hypothesize that having law enforcement officers respond to overdose as a medical emergency rather than as a crime scene may make drug users more willing to call 911 when someone overdoses. The overarching goal of this study is to determine the impact of law enforcement use of naloxone to respond to drug overdoses on two primary outcomes: (1) uptake of drug treatment referrals by overdose victims referred by law enforcement officers, and (2) rates of calling 911 to summon emergency medical services by drug users who witness overdoses. We will achieve these aims through a mixed methods study that includes secondary analysis of data available through our partnership with SDSD, their drug treatment partners the McAlister Institute, and the County of San Diego, including 911 dispatch data, SDSD case records, and treatment data. To complement these data we will conduct qualitative interviews with a community-recruited sample of drug users, to assess their perspectives around treatment referrals provided by SDSD Deputies, and their willingness to call 911 in the event of witnessed overdoses. Interviews and analysis will utilize methods drawn from grounded theory and ethnographic decision tree modeling (a rigorous qualitative method used to describe how individuals and organizations make decisions in given situations). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, with more people dying of overdose than in motor vehicles. One recent response to such deaths is equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone (an overdose antidote which can be sprayed into an overdose victim's nose), and training them to refer overdose victims to drug treatment once they are revived. This study will look at the use of naloxone by the San Diego Sheriff's Department, and will be the first research project in the world to investigate whether or not having law enforcement officers refer drug users to treatment immediately after an overdose is effective, and whether or not having law enforcement officers respond to an overdose as a medical emergency rather than a law enforcement issue makes drug users more likely to call 911 when someone overdoses.",Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health,9259974,R01DA040648,"['911 call', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Antidotes', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'County', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Drug Controls', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug user', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnography', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Fatality rate', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Lawyers', 'Life', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Naloxone', 'Narcotic Antagonists', 'Natural experiment', 'Nose', 'Opioid', 'Organizational Decision Making', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'base', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'empowered', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'overdose death', 'peer', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'rural area', 'secondary analysis', 'theories', 'uptake', 'willingness']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2017,464095,0.09057267786396811
"Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens ABSTRACT Patients with atrial fibrillation, post-acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism are prescribed antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet agents and oral anticoagulants) in dual and triple combinations. These drugs independently cause gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from mucosal defects or vascular abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiac patients are the fastest growing at-risk group due to the rapidly aging US population, their high-burden of co-morbidity, frequent antithrombotic polypharmacy and prescription of new antithrombotic drugs with higher incidence of GI adverse events. The real-world GIB risk of antithrombotic agents used in combination in a diverse cardiac population has yet to be characterized. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated poor performance of existing risk scores (HAS-BLED, CHA2DS2-VASC etc.) for the prediction of non- warfarin antithrombotic drug bleeding; scores frequently used in the clinical setting despite their inaccuracy. Absence of knowledge regarding the real-world risk of antithrombotic-GIB, and the inability to accurately predict which patients will bleed, hampers patient counselling regarding a frequently occurring adverse event which is known to cause morbidity and mortality among cardiac patients. We propose to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying GIB risk in a large, geographically diverse cohort of elderly and non-elderly cardiac patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism or post-acute coronary syndrome. GIB associated with antithrombotic drug combinations will be stratified by underlying cardiac conditions; incidence rates (events/100 patient-years) and propensity-matched Cox proportional models (with 95% confidence intervals) will be used to estimate outcome. We will examine heterogeneity of safety effects related to age, chronic co-morbidity, and hepatic or renal dysfunction. Machine learning techniques will then be used to derive and validate a highly sensitive algorithm for the prediction of antithrombotic-related GIB. Discovery of such an algorithm is the first step in the future application of a predictive model in any evidence-based clinical delivery platform, such as a decision rule or risk calculator. NARRATIVE Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in cardiac patients is common, deadly and on the rise due to an older population, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs used in combination, and availability of new drugs with higher GIB risk than their predecessors. Lack of data regarding the magnitude of GIB and limited knowledge of which patients are most at risk, prevents accurate counselling regarding cardiac drug safety. We will quantify this risk, study risk factors; and use machine learning techniques to derive and validate a clinical algorithm to better predict at-risk patients.",Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens,9365658,R01HS025402,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R01,2017,400000,0.025114962061565386
"Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization Project Summary  The proposed work will accelerate the pace of drug discovery by developing, validating, and testing new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug design. Two fundamental challenges of structure-based drug design are the accurate scoring and ranking of protein-ligand structures, which identiﬁes active com- pounds, and the ability to efﬁciently search a large number of ligands, which ensures that active compounds are sampled. This proposal will address these challenges by developing a novel approach for protein-ligand scoring and expanding the size of the chemical space that can be efﬁciently searched during lead optimiza- tion. The methods will be validated by their prospective application toward the discovery of new anti-cancer molecules and will be made readily accessible through online resources and open-source tools.  The proposal leverages recent and signiﬁcant advances in deep learning and image recognition to develop scoring functions that accurately recognize high-afﬁnity protein-ligand interactions. This is achieved by design- ing and training convolutional neural nets on three-dimensional representations of protein-ligand structures to discriminate between binders and non-binders. Convolutional neural net training will exploit large datasets of afﬁnity and structural data to automatically extract the relevant features necessary to accurately prioritize compounds. Additionally, the proposal develops the ﬁrst means of fully integrating a convolutional neural net scoring function directly into an energy minimization and docking workﬂow.  Interactive virtual screening enables the search of millions of compounds in a few seconds so that queries can be interactively optimized. Interactivity enables the synergistic uniﬁcation of human expert knowledge and efﬁcient computational algorithms. The proposed work will dramatically expand the size of chemical space ac- cessible through interactive virtual screening. Algorithms for efﬁciently searching the chemical space of billions or trillions of compounds implicitly deﬁned by a set of reaction schemas and fragments will be created as part of a lead optimization workﬂow. Fragment-oriented search will be accelerated by a new data structure that combines pharmacophore and molecular shape information into a single sub-linear time index.  The scoring and lead optimization methods developed in this proposal will be released as open-source soft- ware and made immediately available through open-access online resources. As part of the prospective valida- tion of the proposed methods, these resources will be used to identify hit compounds and optimize leads for two targets related to cancer metabolism: serine hydroxymethyltransferase and kidney glutaminase isoform C. Successful completion of the objectives of this proposal will positively impact public health by reducing the cost and time-to-market of developing new drugs, particularly with respect to novel protein targets. Project Narrative  Researchers will be able to more quickly and accurately identify potential drug candidates using the new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug discovery created by this project. These tools will be readily accessible through open-access web sites and open-source software. As part of the project these tools will be used to identify new molecules that are relevant to the treatment of cancer.","Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization",9235506,R01GM108340,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Glutaminase', 'Glutamine', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RANK protein', 'Reaction', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'data structure', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'molecular shape', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'overexpression', 'pharmacophore', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'resource guides', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web interface', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,309750,0.03227973233936409
"EMR Adverse Drug Event Detection for Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adverse drug events (ADEs) result in substantial patient morbidity and lead to over 100,000 deaths yearly. The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cancer drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Medical Record (EMR), discharge summaries, and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" BioNLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EMRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EMR Adverse Drug Event Detection This project proposes innovative intelligent biomedical natural language process approaches to automatically extract adverse drug event from the Electronic Medical Record. It is anticipated that the data resources, algorithms, and the Pharmacovigilance Toolkit developed will significantly enhance ADE detection, patient surveillance and post marketing pharmacovigilance.",EMR Adverse Drug Event Detection for Pharmacovigilance,9123554,U01CA180975,"['Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biology', 'Boxing', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Elements', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Promotion', 'Hematology', 'Hospitals', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'disorder prevention', 'firewall', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lenalidomide', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2016,336980,0.030787394078933144
"Functional regression framework with applications to drug response prediction Drug sensitivity prediction for individual patients is a significant challenge for precision medicine. Current modeling approaches consider prediction of a single feature of the drug response curve such as Area Under the Curve or IC50. However, the single feature summary of the dose response curve does not provide the entire drug sensitivity profile as some features vary systematically with cell lines while others with drugs. The overall goal of this proposal is to design a mathematical and computational framework for dose response curve prediction based on target response curves and genetic characterizations. For individual patients, the problem is formulated as functional prediction from functional predictors. The functional predictors refer to the dose response of specific targets inhibited by the drug that can be obtained from chemical databases and drug kinase activity studies. To achieve our goal, we propose three specific aims: In Aim 1, we will design a Bayesian framework for estimating the significant drivers of a disease along with the design of a model for single and combination drug response prediction. In Aim 2, we will enhance the model by incorporating non-functional predictors in the form of genetic characterizations and develop a joint model to predict dose response curves with both genetic characteristics as well as target response curves as inputs. We propose to develop an efficient way of searching such extremely high dimensional predictor space. In Aim 3, we will develop a hybrid prediction mechanism that combines inferentially motivated model-based techniques and computationally efficient machine learning techniques to improve predictions as well as obtain significant predictors simultaneously. The proposed framework is appropriate for modeling and analyzing cellular response to single or combination of perturbation agents and the successful completion of the aims will allow us to design personalized therapy along with increased understanding of functional response of cells to external perturbations. The proposal considers the design of a novel framework for drug response curve prediction based on drug target profiles and genetic characterizations. The successful implementation of the innovation will have broad societal benefit as it involves facilitating precision medicine with the objective of improved outcomes.",Functional regression framework with applications to drug response prediction,9247487,R01GM122084,"['Area Under Curve', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Techniques', 'base', 'computer framework', 'design', 'drug sensitivity', 'genetic profiling', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'response']",NIGMS,TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,213915,0.06268484918916983
"Mechanisms Underlying Differential Effects of Neighborhood Poverty on Problematic Adolescent Drug Use PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Where a child grows up can inﬂuence his or her risk of problematic drug use. Surprisingly, policies and programs designed to improve neighborhood conditions have yielded conﬂicting results in which some children beneﬁt but others are harmed. Understanding the mechanisms by which neighborhoods act to affect problem- atic drug use and how these mechanisms differ across subgroups and cities—that is, understanding where and for whom mechanisms apply—is essential to optimize the effectiveness of future neighborhood interventions. Mechanisms involving mediation by aspects of the school environment have been unexamined, but could prove promising for understanding differential effects of neighborhood on problematic drug use. The objective of this K99/R00 is to identify school-based mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use and to develop statistical methods to understand how mediation effects differ across subgroup and place. This objective contributes to the long-term goal of improving the effectiveness of interven- tions to prevent drug abuse and dependence by tailoring interventions to address the most relevant mechanisms of action for each target population based on place and individual-level characteristics. The K99 phase ﬁlls the following training gaps that are critical to achieving the research objective and long-term goal: 1) methodologic training in causal mediation analysis; 2) subject-matter training in drug abuse and dependence prevention in ur- ban populations; and 3) involvement in real-world school-based interventions to develop methods with practical utility. Aim 1 of the proposed research identiﬁes the school environment mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and adolescent problematic drug use and modiﬁers of those mechanisms. Aim 2 extends a statistical method recently developed by the proposed research team for generalizing intervention ef- fects from one city to another to generalizing mediation effects. Finally, Aim 3 uses the method developed in Aim 2 to identify how the school environment mechanisms mediating neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use differ across major U.S. cities. The proposed research is expected to identify school-based mechanisms underly- ing differential effects of neighborhood poverty on adolescent problematic drug use by subgroup and place using the only study of randomized neighborhood residence. In addition, it is expected to contribute a novel statistical method that incorporates cutting-edge machine learning techniques to identify which mediation mechanisms can generalize across place, advancing translational research. Successful interventions are assumed to work in differ- ent settings, but that is not the case in practice. The proposed research will allow us to predict intervention effects while accounting for differences in population composition and modiﬁers of the mediation mechanism. This will make a signiﬁcant contribution to improving health by informing the design and targeting of future neighborhood interventions to adolescents and places that may be most impacted in terms of problematic drug use prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is to expected to advance understanding of how two important contexts—neighborhood and school—act together to inﬂuence problematic drug use among adolescents, including how these mechanisms differ across adolescent subgroups and places. In addition, the proposed research will result in the development of a ﬂexible statistical method to predict intervention mechanism effects in new target populations, taking into account population composition. Together, these contributions are anticipated to optimize targeting of future interventions to prevent drug abuse and addiction.",Mechanisms Underlying Differential Effects of Neighborhood Poverty on Problematic Adolescent Drug Use,9163466,K99DA042127,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cities', 'Development', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home visitation', 'Hour', 'House Call', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Schools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tweens', 'Work', 'adolescent drug use', 'base', 'boys', 'bullying', 'career', 'cost', 'design', 'drug abuse prevention', 'girls', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'method development', 'novel', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'residence', 'successful intervention']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K99,2016,155590,0.045153996839221465
"Expansion of an efficient drug repurposing platform for rare genetic diseases. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are thousands of rare genetic diseases that have no approved treatment. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug discovery platform that seeks to re-purpose known drugs for the treatment of such diseases. The platform consists of high content immunofluorescent image analysis and transcellular resistance measurements. These measurements evaluated using machine-learning algorithms to identify relevant and on- target changes induced by both RNAi and various chemicals. These assays can be simultaneously performed on thousands of rare genetic disease models. In this grant, we specifically propose to:  Model 2,000 genetic diseases in multiple human cell types using RNAi technology.  Identify and prioritize 200 of these disease models with the most compelling phenotypic changes, according to multi-parametric quantification.  Utilize these 200 disease models as the basis of chemical suppressor screens of thousands of known drug candidates.  Validate the 20 best drug/disease combinations using an orthogonal genetic manipulation technique in human cells.  Study the best five to ten validated drug/disease combinations in relevant animal models. The proposed study would have significant societal and commercial implications.

"Developing a Systems Biology Platform for Predicting Drug Toxicity and Safety Project Summary Adverse drug reactions (ADRs), more commonly known as drug side effects, are estimated to cause over 100,000 deaths in the US annually, are responsible for 6.5% of all hospital admissions, and 28% of clinical trial failures. Current pharmacological modeling efforts that are commonly used in the pharma industry (such as PK/PD) are generally empirical at the biomolecular level, meaning simplified mathematical terms are used to represent complex physiology. These modeling approaches are used to quantitatively understand therapeutic exposure-response relationships for clinical dosing, but have been less commonly applied to describe toxicological exposure-response relationships, with a few exceptions, as they lack the power to predict systemic cellular effects of pharmaceuticals that underlie ADRs. Elucidating the downstream and systemic effects of pharmaceuticals is critical to understanding ADR pathogenesis. Drugs can affect multiple proteins and each protein that they modulate may play roles in multiple cellular processes. Understanding this multi- factorial physiological response using systems biology methods will ultimately aid in better predicting ADRs before clinical trials using in vitro data. With the increasing emphasis on amassing large datasets, there is more and more publically available knowledge on pharmaceuticals, and their effects on cells, organs, and patients. However throughout all biomedical fields, analyzing complex datasets in a biologically coherent fashion has been a difficult challenge. The goal of this program is to develop a predictive computational platform analyzing gene-expression data sets from drug perturbed in vitro cell lines with metabolic and protein interaction networks for better understanding the systemic effects of over 700 approved pharmaceuticals with known ADRs. The platform, named ADR Predict, will use statistical machine learning approaches to identify network perturbation signatures that are highly predictive of specific ADRs. Developing ADR Predict has significant implications for the pharmaceutical industry. The initial commercialization opportunity of ADR Predict will is through service partnerships with pharmaceutical companies for accelerating and improving the drug development pipeline by mitigating risk of clinical trial safety failures. Further, this proposal will elucidate mechanisms of ADR pathogenesis that will be subsequently experimentally validated in Phase 2. Project Narrative Adverse drug reactions, more commonly known as drug side effects, cause over 100,000 deaths in the US annually, are responsible for 6.5% of all hospital admissions, and 28% of clinical trial failures.

"DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are dangerous and expensive, afflicting about 1.5% of hospitalized patients with profound health and financial consequences. In Medicare patients alone, adverse drug reactions account for 19% of total spending ($339 billion), more than 1,900 deaths, and more than 77,000 extra hospital days per year. Idiosyncratic ADRs, especially rare and severe hypersensitivity-driven ADRs, are the leading cause of medicine withdrawal and termination of clinical development. At the same time, a large proportion of drugs are not associated with hypersensitivity driven ADRs, offering hope that new medicines could avoid them entirely with reliable predictors of risk. Hypersensitivity driven ADRs are caused by the formation of chemically reactive metabolites by metabolic enzymes. These reactive metabolites covalently attach to proteins to become immunogenic and provoke an ADR. Unfortunately, current computational and experimental approaches do not reliably identify drug candidates that form reactive metabolites. These approaches are limited because they inadequately model metabolism, which can both render toxic molecules safe and safe molecules toxic. To overcome this limitation, the proposed study aims to curate a public database of metabolism and reactivity and use this database to build accurate and validated mathematical models of metabolism and reactivity. The models will be constructed using machine-learning algorithms that quantitatively summarize the knowledge from thousands of published studies. The Aims are to (1) curate a database of metabolism and build models that identify rules governing the structure of reaction products during drug metabolism in the liver, (2) curate a database of reactivity and build improved reactivity models that mechanistically predict which metabolites are reactive with biological molecules, and (3) curate a database of reactive metabolites and combine these models to predict when molecules form reactive metabolites that covalently bind proteins. The computational models generated by these Aims will be validated through statistical approaches and against bench-top experiments. Taken together, this approach will substantially improve on existing approaches by more accurately modeling the properties determining whether metabolism renders drugs toxic or safe. The predictive models will make new medicines safer by helping researchers avoid molecules prone to ADRs without harming patients.         PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse drug reactions, especially rare but severe hypersensitivity-driven reactions, have profound financial and health implications and are caused by reactive drug metabolites. As an extension of tools and data developed by our groups, we will build and test mathematical models and datasets that more accurately predict when molecules form clinically important reactive metabolites than current methodologies, such as “structural alerts.” We will use these models to build a tool that will better predict when drug candidates form reactive metabolites, which will make new medicines safer by enabling researchers to avoid drug candidates prone to causing adverse reactions.",DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY,9006922,R01LM012222,"['Accounting', 'Adverse reactions', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Activation', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Relative Risks', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Stevens-Johnson Syndrome', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'Withdrawal', 'adduct', 'data modeling', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug metabolism', 'drug withdrawal', 'gene function', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'liver metabolism', 'macromolecule', 'mathematical model', 'model building', 'novel', 'online repository', 'predictive modeling', 'protein function', 'quantum', 'repository', 'research study', 'screening', 'tool']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,351101,0.050695012992965666
"Text Mining for High-fidelity Curation and Discovery of Gene-drug-phenotype Relationships ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rate at which new drugs are being introduced to market is decreasing, with grave implications for human health. Knowledge about the molecular mechanisms relevant to drug response is critical, but is collected in myriad individual experiments. As a result, the published literature contains rich information about how drugs and genes/gene products interact to produce phenotypes at the molecular, cellular and organismal levels, but this textual data requires substantial additional processing. As a result, there are efforts to manually curate the literature, and extract relationships between three key entities: genes/gene products, drugs and phenotypes-with the goal of representing the information in structured, computable formats. Although automated text mining may ultimately replace expert human curators, its best current role is to triage the literature and bring potentially important information to the attention of human curators. Recent advances in computational natural language processing (NLP) generally, and within our laboratory specifically, offer an opportunity to extract relationships between key entities with high accuracy. In particular, we have prototyped methods that take a relatively small set of examples of a relationship of interest (e.g. examples of gene-drug pairs in which the gene product metabolizes the drug) and then and other pairs that share a similar relationship. These methods can be applied to any relationship between our three key entity types. Thus, we propose an ambitious plan to (1) gather large corpora of biomedical text and extend existing lexicons for these entities, (2) build a database of all sentences/paragraphs relating these entities to one another, (3) create methods for accurately extracting semantically precise relationships from all pairs of entity types, and (4) validate these extracted relationships using both available gold standard data experimental sources and expert curator evaluation. In addition to directly supporting curation, our methods and extractions will be made available as general purpose resources for understanding drug action. Project Narrative Published biological text contains an abundance of valuable information about how drugs work at the molecular, cellular and organism levels and how they affect patients. However, it is difﬁcult to gather all relevant information to support discovery of new drugs and optimal use of existing drugs. This proposal outlines a plan to develop methods for extracting drug-related information from huge collections of text, and using it to improve drug discovery and use.",Text Mining for High-fidelity Curation and Discovery of Gene-drug-phenotype Relationships,9119636,R01LM005652,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Dependency', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Marketing', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Triage', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'gene discovery', 'gene product', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'novel therapeutics', 'research study', 'response', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,340748,0.040331409155760146
"The HMS Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology PROJECT SUMMARY  Systems and computational biologists, physician-scientists, pharmacologists, biochemists and cell biologists will collaborate in a new Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP) to apply a measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. The LSP will pioneer the development of quantitative network-centric approaches to pharmacology and toxicology that include analysis of dose-time-response relationships at a single-cell level, modeling of cellular network dynamics and their perturbation by drugs, development of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models in mouse and ultimately in man and use of systematic approaches to identify and qualify new drug targets. Our approach combines mathematical modeling with empirical measurement (including work with clinical samples and data) and aims to create quantitative and predictive drug response models at different temporal and physical scales. We aim to reinvigorate pharmacology and toxicology as foundational disciplines of translational medicine, develop the conceptual underpinning for personalized and precision medicine and lower the cost of drug discovery by improving its predictability. Close interactions with industry and the FDA will help address the productivity gap in drug discovery and development. The LSP is innovative with respect to its goal of using problems in basic and translational pharmacology to link three disciplines (cell and molecular biology, computational biology and medicine) and its aim of advancing therapeutic science in the Boston area and beyond. Students and postdocs supervised by 18 faculty members, 2 independent postdoctoral fellows and two PhD-level staff from 7 institutions will work in immediate proximity in a new custom-designed laboratory. The lab will host a new graduate program in therapeutics and multi-factored outreach activities that will promote systems pharmacology internationally.  These goals will be achieved through four inter-linked research programs (Aims 1-4), a core dedicated to efficient translation of LSP research (Aim 5), an education core and administrative/outreach activities (Aims 6-8). Aim 1 will focus on the determinants of dose-response at a single-cell level, including the role of cell-to-cell variability in fractional response and of timing and order-of-exposure in combination therapy. Aim 2 will take a network-level approach to understanding therapeutic, toxic and paradoxical drug responses by kinase inhibitors in three types of cancer. The mechanistic basis and consequences of poly-pharmacology will also be examined along with differential drug responsiveness by normal and diseased tissues. Aim 3 will address PK-PD by developing multi-scale models of drug actions at the level of cells, tissues and organisms and new methods for measuring drug distribution at the cellular and subcellular levels. Aim 4 will apply machine learning and causal reasoning to target discovery from clinical records in asthma, inflammatory disease and fibrosis and pursue a structure-guided approach to identifying regulators of ""undruggable "" targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The computational biologists, physician-scientists and pharmacologists in the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology will apply a combined measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. They will develop and apply new tools to (i) investigate the factors that determine the therapeutic index of drugs at a single cell level and in tissues (ii) apply knowledge of cellulr networks to develop a rational approach to combination therapy (iii) identify and qualify new drug targets for significant unmet medical needs.

"Doctor Shopping for Controlled Substances: Insights from Two-Mode Social Network Analysis The proposed project will analyze patterns of doctor shopping for prescription opioids and benzodiazepines using two-mode (i.e. affiliation) social network analysis (SNA). Abuse of prescription opioids and benzodiazepines in the U.S. has risen rapidly, creating a public health crisis. Mortality from drug overdose is higher than motor vehicle accidents and is among the nation's leading preventable causes of death. Doctor shopping is defined as obtaining controlled substances from multiple health care practitioners simultaneously, exceeding the recommended dosage. Doctor shopping is a principle method of obtaining controlled substances for misuse, and an indicator of escalating drug abuse that is associated with a two-fold risk for fatal overdose. Lack of consensus about criteria for classifying doctor shopping has led to wide variation in estimated rates of questionable prescribing activity. This ambiguity poses barriers to understanding factors underlying doctor shopping, and impedes the evaluation of prescription drug policies. Currently, numerical thresholds or multiple provider episodes (MPEs; i.e. overlapping prescriptions) are most often used to identify doctor shoppers, resulting in false positives and negatives. A goal of the proposed study is to determine whether incorporating information about actors' structural position in a two-mode social network of patients and prescribers can produce more valid indictors of illicit behavior. Two-mode network analysis focuses on ties between two different classes or sets of entities. In the proposed project, data form a two-mode network with prescribers in one class and patients in the other, and ties are present only between prescribers and patients. Two-mode SNA is ideal for examining structural patterns in social interaction between two sets of actors, and for determining the most active and central actors in a network. Consistently targeting prescribers that are key players in prescription drug networks may be indicative of strategic doctor shopping behavior or information sharing among patients. Insights from SNA will be used to fine-tune doctor-shopping indicators, improving our ability to detect early signs of abuse, as well as behavior that is intermittent, ambiguous, or less intense, but still problematic. The specific aims of the proposed study are to: 1) Utilize SNA to develop and assess network- based metrics of doctor shopping in comparison to traditional indicators; and 2) Identify characteristics of doctor shopping patients, targeted prescribers, and the point of service. To our knowledge, this is the first study of prescription drug abuse to use two-mode SNA as its methodological approach. This study is significant in applying two-mode SNA – a complex, systems science methodology – to drug abuse research and has the potential to facilitate cost-effective information extraction from extant datasets for translation to policy and practice. The long-term goal of this research is to leverage insights from SNA to improve detection and prevention of doctor shopping and related fraudulent activities, and ultimately reduce the prevalence and public health impact of prescription drug abuse. Abuse of prescription opioids and benzodiazepines has reached epidemic status, and is currently among the nation’s leading preventable causes of death. The proposed research examines social network ties between patients and their prescribing clinicians in a large insurance claims database to identify patterns of prescription seeking that indicate fraudulent activity (e.g. doctor shopping) and possible information sharing among patients who abuse prescription drugs. The goals of this research are to improve detection of early, intermittent, and ambiguous signs of prescription drug abuse behaviors, and to better understand characteristics of patients who engage in doctor shopping and the clinicians they target.",Doctor Shopping for Controlled Substances: Insights from Two-Mode Social Network Analysis,9174102,R01DA039928,"['Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug abuse', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Imagery', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Services', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Solo Practices', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Translations', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'cost effective', 'dosage', 'drug seeking behavior', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'network models', 'novel', 'operation', 'prescription drug abuse', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid abuse', 'programs', 'response', 'standard measure', 'substance misuse', 'trend', 'vehicular accident']",NIDA,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2016,519414,0.023229045671444765
"A Quantitative Systems Pharmacology Software Platform for Biologics: reduce costs and accelerate development of innovative biotherapeutics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Drug development is a very lengthy and expensive undertaking. Failure rate for novel drugs exceeds 95%. Therefore, successful drugs must cover the costs of these failures. As such, prescription drug prices have escalated at an alarming rate and show no signs of stopping. The need for successful drugs to cover failures also means that pharmaceutical companies primarily devote resources to pursuing drug candidates that have a large enough population to allow the company to earn a return on its investment. Thus, diseases that affect only a small portion of the populace are not investigated nearly as much as, say, oncology, cardiovascular or immunology. Current practice usually involves taking modeling techniques developed for small molecule research and trying to adapt them to biologics. However, this approach, more often than not, does not provide the scientist with predictions around feasibility and optimal drug properties, resulting in wasted effort pursuing leads that have no chance of making it through clinical trials, or to be reimbursed by payors. Applied BioMath has developed tools that address high value questions in the middle of the drug development pipeline. By coupling quantitative systems pharmacology techniques with high performance computing and sophisticated mathematical algorithms, we have proven an ability to predict optimal drug properties years before entering the clinic. For the past two years we have been offering our services to pharma and biotechs alike, to rave reviews. We have also been approached with inquiries to license our software. This project will fund the development of our proprietary algorithms and toolsets into a stable, standardized software platform, that can be automatically validated for GLP, for by biologics to develop their internal systems pharmacology models. At its heart, our toolsets are built on Kronecker Bio, an open source biophysical computational engine co­developed by one of our Founders while pursuing his PhD in Biological Engineering with the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This robust platform is currently in use, in its raw form, in the pharmaceutical industry but is limited in its adoption due to its lack of usability, quality contro and GLP validation. This project will focus on the application and presentation layer, allowing the underlying computational functionality to be easily accessed, utilized and understood, so capital requirements are less than a typical software development project. Achieving our goal of building this software platform is only the first step. What follows is a concerted push into the biologics segment, which we are currently seeding through our services offering and gaining a reputation as a firm that delivers high value on time. We have completed our second round of fundraising, raising a total of $1.8m between both rounds. This grant, plus the additional fundraising, will ensure that we are able to roll out our tools and assist drug companies in delivering best­in­class biologics, that meet unmet medical need, on an accelerated timeline to provide patients with a better quality of life. Better, faster, cheaper drugs... truly a win­win­in.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  To reduce the cost of drugs, identify fast failures, and accelerate the rollout of best­in­class biotherapeutics, analyses in the middle of the drug development pipeline, from LI to early clinical trials, based on mechanisms and biophysics, is needed. There are currently a number of open source tools that provide systems pharmacology models for use in research. However, a lack of a standardized and automated GLP validation scheme prevents the models from continuing through to development. A robust, systems pharmacology software platform, widely utilized by drug companies and upon which fit for purpose systems pharmacology models can be built, will greatly reduce the time required to get a drug to market, enable the development of best in class drugs, increase safety for patients and significantly reduce the development costs associated with biologics. We have developed proprietary mechanistic algorithms that we currently use to analyze assays and drug program data for our customers. These algorithms are naturally grouped into certain functions/toolsets. These tools are applicable, depending on what questions are being investigated, across most/all therapeutics areas. While our toolsets (InVitro Analyzer, Biologic Feasibility, Biologic Optimizer, Biologic PKPD, Biologic Mechanistic Covariants) are currently in alpha stage (being used to create fit for purpose models for our clients), they are being used in industry to fulfill our servces contracts. We are looking to create an industry standard platform, leveraging our proprietary algorithms and toolsets, that will allow drug scientists to create fit for purpose models that can be easily validated for GLP use in IND applications. We have sampled the market and estimated a potential target audience of over 100,000 users, worldwide. We arrived at this number by; reviewing the Top 100 Pharma companies by revenue, determining employee count from those companies' annual reports, using our Founders knowledge of select large and small pharma and biotechs and its employee count and number of employees that could use our software, segmenting the list into groups based on revenue, extrapolating on a percent basis each company's applicable target audience, assumed companies outside the Top 100 had one quarter (25%) of the applicable audience as the 100th largest company and then summed these estimates. This produced a number of over 100,000 potential customers. For validation, we determined that the number of people, globally, employed in the pharmaceutical industry is 4,500,000 (2012, www.statista.com). So our target market is less than 3% of total pharma employees and our business model shows market penetration of just over 5% of our target market by 2020, or less than 0.15% of total pharmaceutical employees.        ",A Quantitative Systems Pharmacology Software Platform for Biologics: reduce costs and accelerate development of innovative biotherapeutics,9138949,R44GM116214,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Annual Reports', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biophysics', 'Businesses', 'Capital', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cloud Computing', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Contracts', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Employee', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Immunology', 'Industry', 'Industry Standard', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Price', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TNF gene', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'absorption', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'computer science', 'cost', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'mathematical algorithm', 'meetings', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability', 'wasting', 'working group']",NIGMS,"APPLIED BIOMATH, LLC",R44,2016,469938,0.10111973938678041
"The Interdependency of Drug Resistance Evolution and Drug Design: HIV-1 Protease DESCRIPTION: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies.

"Subtopic 1 : Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic, dose-toxicity modleing and simulation for narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drugs Project Summary The Code of Federal Regulations has defined narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drugs as those having less than 2 - fold difference in median lethal dose and median effective dose or have less than a 2 - fold difference in the minimum toxic concentrations and minimum effective concentrations in the blood. However, there is lack of clear objective set of heuristics to define NTI. Having a clear objective definition is critical from regulatory and industry points of view. The CFR alludes to consider NTI as a factor during bioequivalence (BE) evaluation. There are several publications highlighting the negative impact on efficacy and safety if switching occurs between brand and generic forms of NTI drugs. Furthermore, the Advisory Committee for Pharmaceutical Sciences (ACPS) recommended in April 2010 meeting that the FDA should develop a list of NTI drugs with clear specialized criteria and the current BE standards are not sufficient for NTI drugs. This highlights the importance of development of precise, objective criteria for assessing the BE for NTI drugs. The objective of this research is to utilize principles of pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and steepness of PK/PD relationship to propose quantitative metrics to identify NTI drugs and propose BE criteria to better understand the difference between brand and generic drugs. Simulations as well as published literature information for NTI drugs will be utilized for analysis. Qualitative aspects including the severity of disease and reversibility of adverse events will be incorporated in the decision tree. The decision tree will be evaluated for sensitivity and specificity by applying to approved NTI and non NTI drugs. Followed by evaluation of BE criteria based on statistical comparison of therapeutic goalposts (proportion of patients exceeding and proportion of patients below the therapeutic window) for the brand and the generic drug. In addition, different criteria for PK bioequivalence will be evaluated to determine which PK bioequivalence criteria should be chosen to satisfy a given criteria for therapeutic bioequivalence between brand and generic. This step will involve simulations of PK and PD of approved brand and generic drugs considered as NTI. The deliverables from this research will be a) decision tree that will incorporate both qualitative and quantitative features for deciding whether a drug belongs to NTI or not b) bioequivalence criteria for NTI drugs incorporating information from PK and therapeutic window of approved brand and generic drugs. Narrative The aim of this research is to utilize pharmacometric approaches to propose objective criteria to designate narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drugs. The project will also evaluate if alternate criteria are necessary for approving a NTI generic to enhance public health.","Subtopic 1 : Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic, dose-toxicity modleing and simulation for narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drugs",9131987,U01FD005188,[' '],FDA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,U01,2016,201705,0.10479881337426908
"Computationally modeling the impact of ontogeny on drug metabolic fate   ABSTRACT Advancements in pediatric drug development require innovative approaches that overcome challenges in assessing age-dependent drug disposition and toxic risks related to metabolism. Cytochromes P450 dominate drug metabolism yet roles for individual enzymes depend on genetics, disease states, co-medications, and ontogeny. Failure to account for those differences contributes to dosing challenges and possibly toxicity as reported for dextromethorphan, midazolam, and phenytoin. The NICHD Pediatric Formulation Initiative (PFI) workshops emphasized the need for better modeling to describe and predict how drug metabolism changes for children. Current pharmacokinetic models predict how drug clearance changes with age that affect the optimal dose, but those models are limited in two ways; (1) they require experimentally determined kinetic data for several enzymes that is not often available, and (2) they do not model formation of specific drug metabolites, which is important in predicting toxicity and drug interactions, regardless of whether clearance changes with age. We hypothesize that computational models of mixtures of P450 enzymes can predict how the “metabolic fate”, i.e. the kinetics of drug metabolism and the resulting metabolite structures, of drugs changes with age. We propose building hierarchical mathematical models that at first predict the drug metabolites formed by metabolic enzymes (Aim 1), then the efficiency of formation for each metabolite (the kinetics) (Aim 2), and combine these models to predict metabolites formed by age-specific mixtures of P450s (Aim 3). This proposal makes significant steps toward achieving PFI goals. First, datasets created for this study will be made publicly available to foster model refinement and validation by the community. Second, simulation of metabolite profiles would yield tractable biomarkers and support studies on possible age-dependent drug-drug interactions, off- target biological activities, pro-drug activation, and formation of toxic species. Third, the models will indicate, for both new and existing drugs, when metabolic fate (consequently, toxicity and interactions) changes in pediatric patients, even when pharmacokinetics stay the same. Fourth, though not the primary aim of this study, successfully modeling metabolic efficiency could enable pharmacokinetic studies for predicting problematic pediatric drugs prior to carrying out any necessary experimental kinetic studies. Taken together, this proposal lays a strong foundation for developing models relevant that resolve challenges in optimizing drug dosages and minimizing toxicity risks for children.    PROJECT NARRATIVE The impact of age on cytochrome P450 metabolism makes drug disposition and toxic risks moving targets for pediatric patients, such that robust strategies to identify and assess ontogenetic (age-dependent) effects on drug metabolic fate (in vitro kinetics and metabolite structures) are clearly needed to better personalize drug development for pediatric dosing. As an extension of our prior work, we will build and test computational models and datasets for individual P450 isozymes that accurately predict drug metabolites and the rate (kinetics) at which they form. We will then combine these models for an effective, low cost approach that simulates hepatic P450 metabolism and takes into account age-dependent contributions from individual isozymes to assess the metabolic fate of drugs during child development.  ",Computationally modeling the impact of ontogeny on drug metabolic fate,9215358,R01LM012482,"['Access to Information', 'Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dextromethorphan', 'Dose', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Educational workshop', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Failure', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hepatic', 'Hereditary Disease', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Isoenzymes', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Microsomes', 'Midazolam', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Phenytoin', 'Prodrugs', 'Property', 'Reaction', 'Recombinants', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxin', 'Validation', 'Work', 'absorption', 'age related', 'base', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'dosage', 'drug clearance', 'drug development', 'drug metabolism', 'drug structure', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pediatric patients', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'tool']",NLM,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2016,323537,0.10144328071766655
"High-throughput, all-optical assay in human cardiomyoctes for clinically relevant prediction of drug induced cardiotoxity. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Toxicity accounts for approximately 20% of drug attrition, of which nearly one third is attributed to cardiovascular issues, in particular arrhythmias.1 The cost of bringing a new drug to market can exceed $1.2 billion and require more than 10 years of research. Thus, it is critical to identify cardiotoxicity early in developmen. Current in vitro screening assays for pro-­‐arrhythmic drug effects focus on measuring inhibition of the hERG potassium channel, which has been linked to potentially lethal Torsades de Pointes arrhythmias (TdP).2 The hERG assay, however, lacks high sensitivity and specificity: not all QT prolongation is due to block of hERG alone and not all hERG blockers result in QT prolongation or induce TdP. To address these limitations, regulatory bodies have created the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) initiative2, which proposes use of cardiomyocytes derived from human stem cells as an in vitro model for arrhythmogenic drug potential. Establishment of this model for toxicity screening requires detailed characterization of the cardiomyocyte action potential (AP) and calcium transient (CT), the response of APs/CTs to drugs, and the correlation to clinical outcomes in humans. High-­‐throughput tools needed for performing these measurements, however, have been lacking. Here we propose to develop a high-­‐throughput, all-­‐optical electrophysiology platform for cardiotoxicity screening in sem cell-­‐derived cardiomyocytes. With our Phase I award, we demonstrated that the Optopatch platform could be used to detect changes in the electrophysiological characteristics of human derived CMs following both acute and chronic drug treatment, albeit with the throughput of a single well per recording. To highly parallelize these measurements, we propose building a 96-­‐well plate Optopatch instrument for simultaneous recording of voltage and calcium waveforms under paced conditions from 24 wells. This geometry will provide nearly two orders of magnitude improvement in throughput of our assay. Optopatch constructs will be optimized to allow for incorporation of the actuator and reporter proteins in each cell. We will utilize this platform to screen 50 compounds with known risk scores for Torsades de Pointes in different sources of human cardiomyocytes and use this data to develop a predictive algorithm of arrhythmogenicity.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Q­‐State's technology will allow better prediction of a drug candidate's potential adverse effects to the human heart than the assays mandated by the current cardiac safety guidance ICH S7B.   It will contribute to bringing effective healthcare solutions to market at lower cost and higher productivity, by preventing drugs with cardiotoxicity from reaching the market and preventing the development of valuable therapeutics from being wrongly terminated, which is one of the concerns about the current S7B assays. Making Q-­‐State instrumentation and reagents available to the academic research community will facilitate better mechanistic studies and therapeutics development to benefit patients with cardiac conditions.               ","High-throughput, all-optical assay in human cardiomyoctes for clinically relevant prediction of drug induced cardiotoxity.",9138354,R44HL126314,"['Accounting', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Blinded', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Maturation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Health', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phototoxicity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Potassium Channel', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Software Engineering', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Torsades de Pointes', 'Toxic effect', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'human stem cells', 'in vitro Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'patch clamp', 'phase 1 study', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rate of change', 'response', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cell biology', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NHLBI,"Q-STATE BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2016,602645,0.08134887710930319
"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions. There is however, considerable interindividual variation in efficacy of statins for reducing disease risk, as well as in susceptibility to the most common adverse statin effects, myopathy and type 2 diabetes. The goal of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply complementary investigative approaches and multidisciplinary expertise for discovering and validating the genetic and metabolic factors responsible for this variability. This information has the potential for optimizig use of statins in clinical practice, and for identifying new pathways that underlie the diverse biologic actions of this drug class.              ",Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy,9139479,P50GM115318,"['Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Control Locus', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Simvastatin', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'blood glucose regulation', 'candidate validation', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genotyped patients', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblast', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RES CTR AT OAKLAND,P50,2016,2741022,0.030219809588937847
"Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, having eclipsed motor vehicle-related deaths in 2008. A number of interventions have emerged in the last decade in response to this epidemic, including prescription drug monitoring programs; improving linkages to drug treatment; training drug users and those around them to recognize and respond appropriately to overdose; and, most recently, training and equipping law enforcement officers to use naloxone (an opioid antagonist) at the scene of an overdose. Equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone is intended to capitalize on the fact that officers often arrive at an overdose scene before other emergency services, particularly in rural areas, and until now have not been well equipped to deal with overdose events. In the last 5 years, with the active encouragement of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Department of Justice, law enforcement agencies in at least 28 states are planning to or have begun carrying naloxone to use when they attend overdoses. Despite the proliferation of such programs, this intervention is completely unstudied. In 2014 the San Diego Sheriff's Department began training patrol officers to use naloxone to respond to overdose prior to arrival of other emergency services, and to actively refer overdose victims to a collaborating drug treatment agency after revival. Uptake of drug treatment has been higher than expected (3 of 9 revivals in the 6 month pilot phase of the project entered treatment). We hypothesize that the moments after an overdose represent a ""teachable moment"" in which drug users may be more motivated to enter treatment. In addition, we hypothesize that having law enforcement officers respond to overdose as a medical emergency rather than as a crime scene may make drug users more willing to call 911 when someone overdoses. The overarching goal of this study is to determine the impact of law enforcement use of naloxone to respond to drug overdoses on two primary outcomes: (1) uptake of drug treatment referrals by overdose victims referred by law enforcement officers, and (2) rates of calling 911 to summon emergency medical services by drug users who witness overdoses. We will achieve these aims through a mixed methods study that includes secondary analysis of data available through our partnership with SDSD, their drug treatment partners the McAlister Institute, and the County of San Diego, including 911 dispatch data, SDSD case records, and treatment data. To complement these data we will conduct qualitative interviews with a community-recruited sample of drug users, to assess their perspectives around treatment referrals provided by SDSD Deputies, and their willingness to call 911 in the event of witnessed overdoses. Interviews and analysis will utilize methods drawn from grounded theory and ethnographic decision tree modeling (a rigorous qualitative method used to describe how individuals and organizations make decisions in given situations).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, with more people dying of overdose than in motor vehicles. One recent response to such deaths is equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone (an overdose antidote which can be sprayed into an overdose victim's nose), and training them to refer overdose victims to drug treatment once they are revived. This study will look at the use of naloxone by the San Diego Sheriff's Department, and will be the first research project in the world to investigate whether or not having law enforcement officers refer drug users to treatment immediately after an overdose is effective, and whether or not having law enforcement officers respond to an overdose as a medical emergency rather than a law enforcement issue makes drug users more likely to call 911 when someone overdoses.        ",Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health,9124571,R01DA040648,"['911 call', 'Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Antidotes', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'County', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Drug Controls', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug user', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnography', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Fatality rate', 'Fright', 'Geographic state', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Laws', 'Lawyers', 'Life', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Naloxone', 'Narcotic Antagonists', 'Natural experiment', 'Nose', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'empowered', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'novel', 'overdose death', 'peer', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'rural area', 'theories', 'uptake', 'willingness']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,501918,0.09057267786396811
"Mining health data for drug safety profiles DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical trials, which test the safety and efficacy of drugs in a controlled population, cannot identify all safety issues associated with drugs because the size and characteristics of the target population, duration of use, the concomitant disease conditions and therapies differ markedly in actual usage conditions.  On the outpatient side, medication related morbidity and mortality in the United States is estimated to result in 100,000 deaths and $177 billion in cost annually.  On the inpatient side, it is estimated that roughly 30% of hospital stays have an adverse drug event.  Current one-drug-at-a-time methods for surveillance are woefully inadequate because no one monitors the ""real life"" situation of patients getting over 3 concomitant drugs in the context of multiple co-morbidities.  In preliminary work, we have built an annotation and analysis pipeline that uses the knowledge-graph formed by public biomedical ontologies for the purpose data-mining unstructured clinical notes.  We have demonstrated that we can reproduce drug safety signals from the clinical notes on average 2.7 years ahead of the issue of a drug safety alert.  Using  this  pipeline, we  propose:  1)  to identfy and prioritize multi-drug  combinations that are worth testing; 2) to develop methods for discovering adverse event profiles of multi- drug  combinations; and  3)  to  create  an  EHR  derived  catalogue of potential adverse events of multi-drug combinations.  We will use hierarchies provided by existing public ontologies for drugs, diseases and side- effects to improve signal detection by aggregation, to reduce multiple hypothesis testing and to make a search for multi-drug side effects computationally tractable. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to combine data from electronic medical records, adverse event reports in AERS, and prior knowledge in curated knowledgebases to construct a data-driven safety profile for drugs.  Successful development of novel methods will result in significant cost savings as well as a significant increase in patient safety, given the current rat (~30%) of occurrence of adverse drug events.

"EMR Adverse Drug Event Detection for Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adverse drug events (ADEs) result in substantial patient morbidity and lead to over 100,000 deaths yearly. The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cancer drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Medical Record (EMR), discharge summaries, and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" BioNLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EMRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EMR Adverse Drug Event Detection This project proposes innovative intelligent biomedical natural language process approaches to automatically extract adverse drug event from the Electronic Medical Record. It is anticipated that the data resources, algorithms, and the Pharmacovigilance Toolkit developed will significantly enhance ADE detection, patient surveillance and post marketing pharmacovigilance.",EMR Adverse Drug Event Detection for Pharmacovigilance,8913078,U01CA180975,"['Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biology', 'Boxing', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Elements', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Promotion', 'Hematology', 'Hospitals', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'disorder prevention', 'firewall', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lenalidomide', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2015,339117,0.030787394078933144
"Mining Social Network Postings for Mentions of Potential Adverse Drug Reactions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Drugs undergo extensive testing in animals and clinical trials in humans before they are marketed for widespread use in the population. Pre-market testing produces reasonably high quality information about the efficacy of the drug as a treatment for the condition for which it was approved, but gives a very incomplete picture of the drug's safety. Post-marketing surveillance currently relies mainly on voluntary reporting to the FDA by health care professionals (and recently, patients themselves) through MedWatch, the FDA's safety information and adverse event reporting program. Self-reported patient information captures a valuable perspective that has been found to be of similar quality to that provided by health professionals, and currently it is only captured via the formal MedWatch form. The overarching goal of this application is to deploy the infrastructure needed to explore the value of informal social network postings as a source of ""signals"" of potential adverse drug reactions soon after the drugs hit the market, paying particular attention at the value such information might have to detect adverse events earlier than currently possible, and to detect effects not easily captured by traditional means. Despite the significant challenge of processing colloquial text, our prototype study in this direction showed promising performance in identifying adverse reactions mentioned in these postings, with significant correlations between the effects mentioned by the public and those documented for the drugs we studied. Specific aims to be addressed include: 1). To establish the infrastructure that enables processing of online user comments about the drug on health-related social network websites. Particularly, we seek to recognize and extract mentions of adverse effects in those informal postings, and to map them to standard terminology. We will build on our preliminary lexical approach for finding the mentions, and propose a variation of machine learning (commonly referred to as active learning) where the machine learning framework has the ability to control what instances will be selected for use in the training data, among other innovative semantic approaches to normalization (mapping of the mentions to established, formal terms) and sentiment analysis (to discover whether a mention is reporting a positive or a negative effect); 2) To evaluate the  sensitivity and specificity of the extraction and identification systems, as well as the predictive value of the extracted  knowledge through specific case studies of a set of drugs with well known adverse reactions and by monitoring  postings about a select group of drugs released since 2007. Our existing manually annotated gold standard will be  expanded  through  a  dedicated  annotation  effort  led  by  a  pharmacologist (Karen Smith). 3) To compare the  knowledge  extracted  from  patient  comments  to  what  is  derived  from  the  established  drug  safety  monitoring  scheme overseen by the FDA. We recognize that the data obtained through the deployed infrastructure would not be able to be used to define an ADR standing on its own. However, if this method is validated, it could provide useful signals to complement the already established processes and data sources. Narrative  Adverse drug reactions are currently listed as one of the top 10 causes of death in the US. Identifying adverse  effects of drugs after they are publicly marketed depends mainly on voluntary reporting to the FDA by health  care professionals and recently, patients themselves, via a formal online form. The goal of this project is to  develop the tools needed to exploit the numerous informal social network postings that patients make to  health-related social networks such as Daily Strength as a source of ""signals"" of potential adverse drug  reactions soon after the drugs hit the market. These tools could provide useful signals about adverse effects  earlier than currently possible, hastening the FDA's intervention and reducing the impact that an adverse effect  can have on public health.",Mining Social Network Postings for Mentions of Potential Adverse Drug Reactions,8913770,R01LM011176,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Case Study', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical trials in animals', 'cohort', 'drug development', 'drug efficacy', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'non-compliance', 'post-market', 'programs', 'prototype', 'social networking website', 'tool']",NLM,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2015,282809,0.08892615046529566
"Expansion of an efficient drug repurposing platform for rare genetic diseases.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are thousands of rare genetic diseases that have no approved treatment.

"HLS13-04 High-Content High-Throughput Screen for Diamond Blackfan Anemia Treatments ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are thousands of rare genetic diseases that have no approved treatment. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug discovery platform that seeks to re-purpose known drugs for the treatment of such diseases. The platform consists of high content immunofluorescent image analysis using machine-learning algorithms to identify relevant and on-target changes induced by both RNAi and various chemicals. This system has been used to identify a phenotype for loss of function of two related genes, RPS19 and RPS10 in multiple human cell types.

"Text Mining for High-fidelity Curation and Discovery of Gene-drug-phenotype Relationships ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rate at which new drugs are being introduced to market is decreasing, with grave implications for human health. Knowledge about the molecular mechanisms relevant to drug response is critical, but is collected in myriad individual experiments. As a result, the published literature contains rich information about how drugs and genes/gene products interact to produce phenotypes at the molecular, cellular and organismal levels, but this textual data requires substantial additional processing. As a result, there are efforts to manually curate the literature, and extract relationships between three key entities: genes/gene products, drugs and phenotypes-with the goal of representing the information in structured, computable formats. Although automated text mining may ultimately replace expert human curators, its best current role is to triage the literature and bring potentially important information to the attention of human curators. Recent advances in computational natural language processing (NLP) generally, and within our laboratory specifically, offer an opportunity to extract relationships between key entities with high accuracy. In particular, we have prototyped methods that take a relatively small set of examples of a relationship of interest (e.g. examples of gene-drug pairs in which the gene product metabolizes the drug) and then and other pairs that share a similar relationship. These methods can be applied to any relationship between our three key entity types. Thus, we propose an ambitious plan to (1) gather large corpora of biomedical text and extend existing lexicons for these entities, (2) build a database of all sentences/paragraphs relating these entities to one another, (3) create methods for accurately extracting semantically precise relationships from all pairs of entity types, and (4) validate these extracted relationships using both available gold standard data experimental sources and expert curator evaluation. In addition to directly supporting curation, our methods and extractions will be made available as general purpose resources for understanding drug action.             Project Narrative Published biological text contains an abundance of valuable information about how drugs work at the molecular, cellular and organism levels and how they affect patients. However, it is difﬁcult to gather all relevant information to support discovery of new drugs and optimal use of existing drugs.

"The HMS Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology PROJECT SUMMARY  Systems and computational biologists, physician-scientists, pharmacologists, biochemists and cell biologists will collaborate in a new Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP) to apply a measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. The LSP will pioneer the development of quantitative network-centric approaches to pharmacology and toxicology that include analysis of dose-time-response relationships at a single-cell level, modeling of cellular network dynamics and their perturbation by drugs, development of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models in mouse and ultimately in man and use of systematic approaches to identify and qualify new drug targets. Our approach combines mathematical modeling with empirical measurement (including work with clinical samples and data) and aims to create quantitative and predictive drug response models at different temporal and physical scales. We aim to reinvigorate pharmacology and toxicology as foundational disciplines of translational medicine, develop the conceptual underpinning for personalized and precision medicine and lower the cost of drug discovery by improving its predictability. Close interactions with industry and the FDA will help address the productivity gap in drug discovery and development. The LSP is innovative with respect to its goal of using problems in basic and translational pharmacology to link three disciplines (cell and molecular biology, computational biology and medicine) and its aim of advancing therapeutic science in the Boston area and beyond. Students and postdocs supervised by 18 faculty members, 2 independent postdoctoral fellows and two PhD-level staff from 7 institutions will work in immediate proximity in a new custom-designed laboratory. The lab will host a new graduate program in therapeutics and multi-factored outreach activities that will promote systems pharmacology internationally.  These goals will be achieved through four inter-linked research programs (Aims 1-4), a core dedicated to efficient translation of LSP research (Aim 5), an education core and administrative/outreach activities (Aims 6-8). Aim 1 will focus on the determinants of dose-response at a single-cell level, including the role of cell-to-cell variability in fractional response and of timing and order-of-exposure in combination therapy. Aim 2 will take a network-level approach to understanding therapeutic, toxic and paradoxical drug responses by kinase inhibitors in three types of cancer. The mechanistic basis and consequences of poly-pharmacology will also be examined along with differential drug responsiveness by normal and diseased tissues. Aim 3 will address PK-PD by developing multi-scale models of drug actions at the level of cells, tissues and organisms and new methods for measuring drug distribution at the cellular and subcellular levels. Aim 4 will apply machine learning and causal reasoning to target discovery from clinical records in asthma, inflammatory disease and fibrosis and pursue a structure-guided approach to identifying regulators of ""undruggable "" targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The computational biologists, physician-scientists and pharmacologists in the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology will apply a combined measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. They will develop and apply new tools to (i) investigate the factors that determine the therapeutic index of drugs at a single cell level and in tissues (ii) apply knowledge of cellulr networks to develop a rational approach to combination therapy (iii) identify and qualify new drug targets for significant unmet medical needs.

"The Interdependency of Drug Resistance Evolution and Drug Design: HIV-1 Protease DESCRIPTION: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies. The pressures of evolution will likely result in a variety of pathways for resistance to evolve. Drug resistance can be caused by a change in the balance of molecular recognition events that selectively weakens inhibitor binding but maintains the biological function of the therapeutic target. To reduce the likelihood of drug resistance, the interdependency of the target's function within the context of the biological system in which it exists must be elucidated. Disrupting the therapeutic target's activity is necessary but not sufficient for avoiding resistance. In this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that key pathways and coupled mechanisms confer drug resistance to therapeutic targets. We seek to define the sequence, structural and dynamic, and temporal evolutionary constraints of the interdependency of drug resistance: 1) to recognize the pathways by which resistance occurs and 2) to devise drug design strategies for developing a drug that is robust against resistance. HIV-1 Protease is the perfect case study! HIV evolves very quickly with on average a point mutation introduced in every third genome replicated. HIV protease inhibitors have the potential of being both very potent and robust to resistance. Protease inhibitors are the only HIV inhibitor class that are transition state analogs and can be evolutionarily constrained within the substrate envelope. Inhibitors that leverage both of these characteristics, such as Darunavir (DRV) and similar analogs, have the potential of being robust, nearly resistance proof inhibitors, to drug- naïve HIV infected patients. If HIV achieves resistance to these inhibitors it is only through complex pathways and combinations of mutations. Further elucidating these complex pathways will bring us closer to resistance-proof inhibitors. In this project our team will use and develop cutting-edge technology to follow the pathways of drug resistance selection, to elucidate the molecular basis for their interdependent patterns and incorporate these mechanisms into drug design strategies. Together we will make inroads into tackling drug resistance that would be impossible for any of us to individually achieve PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies. The pressures of evolution will likely result in a variety of pathways for resistance to evolve. HIV evolves very quickly with on average a point mutation introduced in every third genome replicated.

"Subtopic 1 : Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic, dose-toxicity modleing and simulation for narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drugs Project Summary The Code of Federal Regulations has defined narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drugs as those having less than 2 - fold difference in median lethal dose and median effective dose or have less than a 2 - fold difference in the minimum toxic concentrations and minimum effective concentrations in the blood. However, there is lack of clear objective set of heuristics to define NTI. Having a clear objective definition is critical from regulatory and industry points of view. The CFR alludes to consider NTI as a factor during bioequivalence (BE) evaluation. There are several publications highlighting the negative impact on efficacy and safety if switching occurs between brand and generic forms of NTI drugs. Furthermore, the Advisory Committee for Pharmaceutical Sciences (ACPS) recommended in April 2010 meeting that the FDA should develop a list of NTI drugs with clear specialized criteria and the current BE standards are not sufficient for NTI drugs. This highlights the importance of development of precise, objective criteria for assessing the BE for NTI drugs. The objective of this research is to utilize principles of pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and steepness of PK/PD relationship to propose quantitative metrics to identify NTI drugs and propose BE criteria to better understand the difference between brand and generic drugs. Simulations as well as published literature information for NTI drugs will be utilized for analysis. Qualitative aspects including the severity of disease and reversibility of adverse events will be incorporated in the decision tree. The decision tree will be evaluated for sensitivity and specificity by applying to approved NTI and non NTI drugs. Followed by evaluation of BE criteria based on statistical comparison of therapeutic goalposts (proportion of patients exceeding and proportion of patients below the therapeutic window) for the brand and the generic drug. In addition, different criteria for PK bioequivalence will be evaluated to determine which PK bioequivalence criteria should be chosen to satisfy a given criteria for therapeutic bioequivalence between brand and generic. This step will involve simulations of PK and PD of approved brand and generic drugs considered as NTI. The deliverables from this research will be a) decision tree that will incorporate both qualitative and quantitative features for deciding whether a drug belongs to NTI or not b) bioequivalence criteria for NTI drugs incorporating information from PK and therapeutic window of approved brand and generic drugs. Narrative The aim of this research is to utilize pharmacometric approaches to propose objective criteria to designate narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drugs. The project will also evaluate if alternate criteria are necessary for approving a NTI generic to enhance public health.","Subtopic 1 : Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic, dose-toxicity modleing and simulation for narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drugs",8924789,U01FD005188,[' '],FDA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,U01,2015,196098,0.10479881337426908
"Tiered Testing Strategy for Assessing Thermal Effects on Transdermal Products   Many transdermal systems are affected by temperature and are labeled with a warning against heat application. For example, heat can increase skin permeability. Heat can affect drug solubility in a formulation and drug (and excipient) release from the transdermal system. Heat can also increase dermal clearance and systemic drug absorption via the vascular network. Heat effects can be different among different transdermal delivery systems. In the FDA review process, when the reference product has a label warning against heat application, the generic product cannot be more sensitive to heat than the reference product. Different heat effects among transdermal products can be due to different drug release (and formulation release) from the products. In addition, due to the different formulation release under heat, these formulations can exert different effects on skin permeability. The different formulation release and penetration into the dermis can also affect dermal clearance for systemic drug absorption. The objectives of this project are to (a) investigate the in vitro release test conditions for identifying heat effects on transdermal delivery and (b) develop an in vitro test process to be used in the reviews of transdermal products to ensure that generic products do not introduce any additional safety risks. We will evaluate the influence of heat upon the rate of drug release from the patch using in vitro release testing of USP dissolution apparatus (tier 1), drug and formulation permeation across skin using Franz diffusion cells (tier 2), and dermal clearance analyses using an existing, state-of-the-art, skin diffusion model to determine dermis concentration and drug absorption into the vascular network in the dermis (tier 3). It is hypothesize that this tiered in vitro testing strategy will yield a scientifically-based decision tree to support the evaluation of thermal effects for ANDA approvals of transdermal products.   The performance of a transdermal drug delivery system can be affected by temperature and this poses a safety risk. In FDA reviews, heat effect on a generic transdermal product must not be more pronounced than that of the reference (brand name) product. Evidence such as human clinical data to show that the generic product is not less safe than the reference product under the application of heat is required. The present project will develop an in vitro test method for evaluating heat effect on transdermal generic products.",Tiered Testing Strategy for Assessing Thermal Effects on Transdermal Products,8924785,U01FD004942,[' '],FDA,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,U01,2015,250000,0.06659737866163713
"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions. There is however, considerable interindividual variation in efficacy of statins for reducing disease risk, as well as in susceptibility to the most common adverse statin effects, myopathy and type 2 diabetes. The goal of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply complementary investigative approaches and multidisciplinary expertise for discovering and validating the genetic and metabolic factors responsible for this variability. This information has the potential for optimizig use of statins in clinical practice, and for identifying new pathways that underlie the diverse biologic actions of this drug class.              ",Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy,8934878,P50GM115318,"['Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Control Locus', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Simvastatin', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'candidate validation', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblast', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RES CTR AT OAKLAND,P50,2015,2836708,0.030219809588937847
"Using Biomedical Knowledge to Identify Plausible Signals for Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need to monitor unintended effects of approved drugs has been highlighted by several recent high-profile events in which fatal side effects of drugs were detected after their release to market. Notoriously, the Cox-2 inhibitor Rofecoxib (Vioxx) was withdrawn from market on account of evidence suggesting that treatment with the drug increased the rate of coronary artery disease, and recently new evidence has emerged suggesting the commonly used antibiotic Azithromycin (Zithromax) may cause fatal arrythmias. In an effort to mitigate the morbidity and mortality resulting from such undetected side effects, regulatory bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have instituted spontaneous reporting systems to systematize post-marketing surveillance. However there is evidence that under-reporting of adverse drug events (ADEs) is widespread. Automated monitoring of events documented in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) as free text or structured data has been proposed as a path toward earlier identification of meaningfully correlated drug-event pairs. As these pairs must ultimately be reviewed by domain experts to assess their implications, there is a pressing need to develop methods to selectively identify plausible drug-event pairs within the large pool of correlations to be found in clinical data. In the proposed research, we will develop and evaluate models of biological plausibility, based on knowledge extracted from the biomedical literature and using methods of hyperdimensional computing for efficient search and inference across multiple concepts and relations simultaneously. These methods will be used to selectively identify plausible drug-event pairs found in structured clinical data, and extracted from unstructured data using natural language extraction. The developed methods will be evaluated formatively, for their ability to rediscover known side effects from the biomedical literature, and summatively for their ability to improve the precision of effects attributed to a st of known drugs using statistical methods alone. In addition we will evaluate their ability to predict recent FDA warnings, using historical data and knowledge. If successful, the proposed research will provide the means to identify automatically plausible drug-event pairs for regulatory purposes, mitigating consequent morbidity and mortality. In addition, the methods will provide a generalizable approach that can be used to apply knowledge derived from the biomedical literature to interpret clinical data. Project Narrative The need to monitor unintended effects of medications has been highlighted by several high-profile events in which fatal side effects of approved drugs were detected after their release to market.

"Mining health data for drug safety profiles DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical trials, which test the safety and efficacy of drugs in a controlled population, cannot identify all safety issues associated with drugs because the size and characteristics of the target population, duration of use, the concomitant disease conditions and therapies differ markedly in actual usage conditions.  On the outpatient side, medication related morbidity and mortality in the United States is estimated to result in 100,000 deaths and $177 billion in cost annually.  On the inpatient side, it is estimated that roughly 30% of hospital stays have an adverse drug event.  Current one-drug-at-a-time methods for surveillance are woefully inadequate because no one monitors the ""real life"" situation of patients getting over 3 concomitant drugs in the context of multiple co-morbidities.  In preliminary work, we have built an annotation and analysis pipeline that uses the knowledge-graph formed by public biomedical ontologies for the purpose data-mining unstructured clinical notes.  We have demonstrated that we can reproduce drug safety signals from the clinical notes on average 2.7 years ahead of the issue of a drug safety alert.  Using  this  pipeline, we  propose:  1)  to identfy and prioritize multi-drug  combinations that are worth testing; 2) to develop methods for discovering adverse event profiles of multi- drug  combinations; and  3)  to  create  an  EHR  derived  catalogue of potential adverse events of multi-drug combinations.  We will use hierarchies provided by existing public ontologies for drugs, diseases and side- effects to improve signal detection by aggregation, to reduce multiple hypothesis testing and to make a search for multi-drug side effects computationally tractable. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to combine data from electronic medical records, adverse event reports in AERS, and prior knowledge in curated knowledgebases to construct a data-driven safety profile for drugs.  Successful development of novel methods will result in significant cost savings as well as a significant increase in patient safety, given the current rat (~30%) of occurrence of adverse drug events.

"A Novel System for Non-Invasive Characterization of Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cellogy has developed a novel technology concept, called PulseTM, for the functional characterization of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Pulse performs automated characterization of beating cardiomyocytes using video microscopy and novel image analysis algorithms, and provides a level of automation and scale otherwise not available. Pulse generates measurements of beating frequency, irregularity, and QT interval based on motion analysis of phase contrast images captured at a fast frame rate. Pulse is the first beating assay designed to be fully compatible with common cell culture practices, completely non-invasive to cells, and cost- effective, making it ideal for large-scale cardiovascular drug development and cardiotoxicity testing. In addition, Pulse accommodates any type of cell plating by automatically recognizing distinct beating regions, enabling new types of high-throughput single-cell studies. Cardiac safety is an important problem facing the pharmaceutical industry, and accounts for nearly 40% of the withdrawal of FDA-approved drugs from the market. The concerns over cardiac safety are further complicated by the extremely high costs of new drug development and the low success rates of late-stage clinical trials. There is therefore a significant need for better tools to predict cardiotoxicity during the preclinical stages of drug development. Such tools would have a significant impact on human health and the U.S. economy by developing safer drugs and reducing costs related to drug failures. Patch clamp assays are the current standard reference for high-precision electrical measurements of single cardiomyocytes. However, they require manual setup by a trained expert. Such assays are inherently a low-throughput technology that will not scale to meet the demand of large-scale drug testing. One alternative, imaging of calcium signaling, is useful as a reference, but limited by potential interactions with other compounds. We believe that a contact-free, label-free imaging technique is not only a viable alternative, but also a technology that will enable cost effective high-throughput analysis in a completely automated fashion. Such automated and non-invasive assays can be used more routinely for drug development, and ultimately for patient specific studies. Over the past year, we have successfully completed the initial development phase and demonstrated the feasibility of our Pulse technology platform. In this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR proposal, we seek funding to support and accelerate the development of the Pulse product. Our goal is to continue to innovate and optimize the Pulse product so it may become the standard 'go-to' assay for cardiomyocyte-based drug screening and toxicity testing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes hold tremendous potential for drug development and safety testing related to cardiovascular health.

"EMR Adverse Drug Event Detection for Pharmacovigilance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adverse drug events (ADEs) result in substantial patient morbidity and lead to over 100,000 deaths yearly. The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cancer drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Medical Record (EMR), discharge summaries, and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" BioNLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EMRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EMR Adverse Drug Event Detection This project proposes innovative intelligent biomedical natural language process approaches to automatically extract adverse drug event from the Electronic Medical Record.

"Mining Social Network Postings for Mentions of Potential Adverse Drug Reactions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Drugs undergo extensive testing in animals and clinical trials in humans before they are marketed for widespread use in the population. Pre-market testing produces reasonably high quality information about the efficacy of the drug as a treatment for the condition for which it was approved, but gives a very incomplete picture of the drug's safety. Post-marketing surveillance currently relies mainly on voluntary reporting to the FDA by health care professionals (and recently, patients themselves) through MedWatch, the FDA's safety information and adverse event reporting program. Self-reported patient information captures a valuable perspective that has been found to be of similar quality to that provided by health professionals, and currently it is only captured via the formal MedWatch form. The overarching goal of this application is to deploy the infrastructure needed to explore the value of informal social network postings as a source of ""signals"" of potential adverse drug reactions soon after the drugs hit the market, paying particular attention at the value such information might have to detect adverse events earlier than currently possible, and to detect effects not easily captured by traditional means. Despite the significant challenge of processing colloquial text, our prototype study in this direction showed promising performance in identifying adverse reactions mentioned in these postings, with significant correlations between the effects mentioned by the public and those documented for the drugs we studied. Specific aims to be addressed include: 1). To establish the infrastructure that enables processing of online user comments about the drug on health-related social network websites. Particularly, we seek to recognize and extract mentions of adverse effects in those informal postings, and to map them to standard terminology. We will build on our preliminary lexical approach for finding the mentions, and propose a variation of machine learning (commonly referred to as active learning) where the machine learning framework has the ability to control what instances will be selected for use in the training data, among other innovative semantic approaches to normalization (mapping of the mentions to established, formal terms) and sentiment analysis (to discover whether a mention is reporting a positive or a negative effect); 2) To evaluate the  sensitivity and specificity of the extraction and identification systems, as well as the predictive value of the extracted  knowledge through specific case studies of a set of drugs with well known adverse reactions and by monitoring  postings about a select group of drugs released since 2007. Our existing manually annotated gold standard will be  expanded  through  a  dedicated  annotation  effort  led  by  a  pharmacologist (Karen Smith). 3) To compare the  knowledge  extracted  from  patient  comments  to  what  is  derived  from  the  established  drug  safety  monitoring  scheme overseen by the FDA. We recognize that the data obtained through the deployed infrastructure would not be able to be used to define an ADR standing on its own. However, if this method is validated, it could provide useful signals to complement the already established processes and data sources. Narrative  Adverse drug reactions are currently listed as one of the top 10 causes of death in the US. Identifying adverse  effects of drugs after they are publicly marketed depends mainly on voluntary reporting to the FDA by health  care professionals and recently, patients themselves, via a formal online form. The goal of this project is to  develop the tools needed to exploit the numerous informal social network postings that patients make to  health-related social networks such as Daily Strength as a source of ""signals"" of potential adverse drug  reactions soon after the drugs hit the market. These tools could provide useful signals about adverse effects  earlier than currently possible, hastening the FDA's intervention and reducing the impact that an adverse effect  can have on public health.",Mining Social Network Postings for Mentions of Potential Adverse Drug Reactions,8722028,R01LM011176,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Case Study', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical trials in animals', 'cohort', 'drug development', 'drug efficacy', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'non-compliance', 'post-market', 'programs', 'prototype', 'social networking website', 'tool']",NLM,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2014,338807,0.08892615046529566
"Predictive Structure-Based Models of Malaria Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposed effort is to develop predictive models of future Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild, leading to discovery of novel anti-malarial therapeutics againt drug resistant strains in advance of these mutations. Through this SC3 research, we will perform a comprehensive structure-based analysis of DHFR protein evolution in order to generate site-specific predictive models of likely amino acid replacements and identify locations where compensating amino acid replacements may be occurring in response to selection pressures.  Research will commence with generation of a comprehensive phylogenetic tree using DHFR protein sequences obtained from public domain databases. Ancestral sequences will be predicted for key clades in DHFR evolution. 3D homology models will then be generated for each of these ancestral sequences that will be added sequentially to an already existing structure-based sequence alignment generated from a superposition of experimentally determined x-ray crystal structures of wild-type (wt) DHFR from 22 species. Predictive models of site-specific amino acid replacements will be generated using tools and techniques taken from the field of computational intelligence and machine learning that include HMMs and ANNs. These models will be tested and validated by using the first 70% of the phylogeny in order to predict the remaining 30%. Using the insights gained from these predictive models, an analysis will be performed with mutant DHFR sequences of P. falciparum and P. vivax to study the intraspecies differentiation that gave rise to drug resistance. Hypothetical DHFR sequences and homology models representing next steps in Plasmodium DHFR evolution will be generated. In silico docking experiments will be performed with existing anti-malarial drugs as well as known inhibitors of DHFR. Examination of the predicted protein-ligand interactions from these studies will provide additional insights into the acquisition of drug resistance.  Through this proposed effort, an innovative technology for studying and modeling DHFR protein evolution is realized. Predictive models of potential next steps in P. falciparum and P. vivax DHFR evolution will be generated as a proof of concept of this approach. This technology has far-reaching benefits including the generation of hypotheses for intraspecies differentiation and origins of drug resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax as well as the ability to generate predictive models of future DHFR protein evolution providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery before drug resistance develops in the wild.          Approximately forty-one percent of the world's population lives in areas where malaria is transmitted and each year and it is estimated that 350-500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide. Two of the most prevalent malaria strains, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) have developed clinical resistance to antifolate compounds that target the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) such as pyrimethamine and cycloguanil. Consequently, there remains a serious and immediate need for the development of novel antimalarial therapeutics that target drug-resistant strains. Using the proposed approach, we will develop predictive models of future Pf-DHFR and Pv-DHFR protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild. Afterthe completion of this SC3 research, we plan to integrate these predictive models into a comprehensive computational intelligence- based drug discovery platform thus providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery resulting in timely development of novel anti-malarial therapeutics to meet future needs. This approach will be tested on DHFR for novel antimalarial drug discovery; however, the methods developed can be applied broadly in early stage drug discovery and development.

"Detection of Potential Drug Effect Signals from Twitter Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients, as the consumer of pharmaceutical products, are the most important contributor to drug safety surveillance. Yet studies show that the rate of patient participation is low when traditional methods of reporting drug effects-such as spontaneous reporting systems-are used. Studies have also documented that patients report their experiences in different ways and in more detail than healthcare professionals. Furthermore, traditional methods of collecting patient reports are typically slow and costly. The objective of the proposed research is to investigate whether patient experiences of drug effects can be detected directly from their posts on Twitter. We propose to retrieve and collect Twitter posts and conversations related to a list of 100 pre-selected drugs, to extract from the collection the posts that demonstrate patients' personal experiences, and to identify any effects mentioned in the drug-related personal experience Tweets. This data will be analyzed to assess the relationships between different drugs and reported beneficial or adverse effects, and to ascertain whether or not the effects have been previously reported. A data processing pipeline will be devised to automate many components of the data collection and analysis process which is expected to reduce the cost and speed up the discovery of any potential drug effects. A machine-learning-based method will be developed to identify the Twitter posts that demonstrate a user's experience. The National Library of Medicine's MetaMap software will be employed to map the word phrases identified in Twitter posts to UMLS semantic types, among which many are related drug effects. To assess the validity of our approach, healthcare professionals with knowledge and experience in drug safety surveillance will participate in verifying and annotating drug-related personal experience Twitter posts, and confirming the drug effect relationship.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug reactions are a leading cause of death in developing nations. Patient participation in reporting drug effects has been low, leading to under-reporting of many drug effects.

"NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING DESCRIPTION  Abstract:  We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique  for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional  structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective  in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates  computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess  for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption,  distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways.  The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be iteratively  refined using machine learning techniques.  We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight  human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is  the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against  these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community.  In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified  their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of  the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus  far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies.  The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted  lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use.  The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive computational drug discovery pipeline, applicable to any  disease, thereby increasing the success rate and reducing the risk, cost, and time associated with traditional  drug discovery methods. This Pioneer award application will focus on the creation and improvement of computational methods to  develop broad spectrum therapeutics against any infectious or inherited disease. Pathogens of focus include  all human herpes viruses (HHVs), which infect billions worldwide every year, with a significant mortality rate in  immunocompromised patients; yet limited therapeutics exist for many of these viruses and virus populations  are becoming resistant to current drugs.

"Mapping the Drugome: predictive network approaches to drug safety surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This application for the K99/R00 ""Pathway to Independence"" program aims to support Dr. Aurel Cami's development into an independent investigator in the field of Biomedical Informatics. The proposed career development period consists of a two-year mentored phase and a three-year independent phase. During the first phase, mentored by Drs. Reis, Kohane, Szolovits, and Manzi, the applicant will obtain formal training in drug safety and in biostatistics/machine learning methods for developing advanced predictive network models. This training will provide the groundwork for the proposed research project. The overall goal of this project is to develop novel surveillance approaches that leverage the inherent network structure of drug safety relationships across the entire drugome in order to predict adverse events earlier and more accurately. The project has four specific aims: 1. Construct and characterize integrated Drug Safety Network representations of the drugome. 2. Develop predictive network models to identify unknown drug-AE associations. 3. Develop predictive network models to identify unknown drug-drug-AE interactions. 4. Systematically evaluate model performance, both retrospectively and prospectively. The preliminary research studies have shown that predictive network models can sensitively and specifically detect drug-AE associations and drug-drug interactions, providing strong motivation for the proposed research. With a background in predictive network modeling and public health drug surveillance, Dr. Cami is highly qualified to conduct the proposed research. This project brings together a broad, interdisciplinary team of mentor, co-mentors and advisors with extensive combined experience in every aspect of the proposed research.

"The HMS Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology PROJECT SUMMARY  Systems and computational biologists, physician-scientists, pharmacologists, biochemists and cell biologists will collaborate in a new Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP) to apply a measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. The LSP will pioneer the development of quantitative network-centric approaches to pharmacology and toxicology that include analysis of dose-time-response relationships at a single-cell level, modeling of cellular network dynamics and their perturbation by drugs, development of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models in mouse and ultimately in man and use of systematic approaches to identify and qualify new drug targets. Our approach combines mathematical modeling with empirical measurement (including work with clinical samples and data) and aims to create quantitative and predictive drug response models at different temporal and physical scales. We aim to reinvigorate pharmacology and toxicology as foundational disciplines of translational medicine, develop the conceptual underpinning for personalized and precision medicine and lower the cost of drug discovery by improving its predictability. Close interactions with industry and the FDA will help address the productivity gap in drug discovery and development. The LSP is innovative with respect to its goal of using problems in basic and translational pharmacology to link three disciplines (cell and molecular biology, computational biology and medicine) and its aim of advancing therapeutic science in the Boston area and beyond. Students and postdocs supervised by 18 faculty members, 2 independent postdoctoral fellows and two PhD-level staff from 7 institutions will work in immediate proximity in a new custom-designed laboratory. The lab will host a new graduate program in therapeutics and multi-factored outreach activities that will promote systems pharmacology internationally.  These goals will be achieved through four inter-linked research programs (Aims 1-4), a core dedicated to efficient translation of LSP research (Aim 5), an education core and administrative/outreach activities (Aims 6-8). Aim 1 will focus on the determinants of dose-response at a single-cell level, including the role of cell-to-cell variability in fractional response and of timing and order-of-exposure in combination therapy. Aim 2 will take a network-level approach to understanding therapeutic, toxic and paradoxical drug responses by kinase inhibitors in three types of cancer. The mechanistic basis and consequences of poly-pharmacology will also be examined along with differential drug responsiveness by normal and diseased tissues. Aim 3 will address PK-PD by developing multi-scale models of drug actions at the level of cells, tissues and organisms and new methods for measuring drug distribution at the cellular and subcellular levels. Aim 4 will apply machine learning and causal reasoning to target discovery from clinical records in asthma, inflammatory disease and fibrosis and pursue a structure-guided approach to identifying regulators of ""undruggable "" targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The computational biologists, physician-scientists and pharmacologists in the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology will apply a combined measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. They will develop and apply new tools to (i) investigate the factors that determine the therapeutic index of drugs at a single cell level and in tissues (ii) apply knowledge of cellulr networks to develop a rational approach to combination therapy (iii) identify and qualify new drug targets for significant unmet medical needs.

"Subtopic 1 : Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic, dose-toxicity modleing and simulation for narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drugs Project Summary The Code of Federal Regulations has defined narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drugs as those having less than 2 - fold difference in median lethal dose and median effective dose or have less than a 2 - fold difference in the minimum toxic concentrations and minimum effective concentrations in the blood. However, there is lack of clear objective set of heuristics to define NTI. Having a clear objective definition is critical from regulatory and industry points of view. The CFR alludes to consider NTI as a factor during bioequivalence (BE) evaluation. There are several publications highlighting the negative impact on efficacy and safety if switching occurs between brand and generic forms of NTI drugs. Furthermore, the Advisory Committee for Pharmaceutical Sciences (ACPS) recommended in April 2010 meeting that the FDA should develop a list of NTI drugs with clear specialized criteria and the current BE standards are not sufficient for NTI drugs. This highlights the importance of development of precise, objective criteria for assessing the BE for NTI drugs. The objective of this research is to utilize principles of pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and steepness of PK/PD relationship to propose quantitative metrics to identify NTI drugs and propose BE criteria to better understand the difference between brand and generic drugs. Simulations as well as published literature information for NTI drugs will be utilized for analysis. Qualitative aspects including the severity of disease and reversibility of adverse events will be incorporated in the decision tree. The decision tree will be evaluated for sensitivity and specificity by applying to approved NTI and non NTI drugs. Followed by evaluation of BE criteria based on statistical comparison of therapeutic goalposts (proportion of patients exceeding and proportion of patients below the therapeutic window) for the brand and the generic drug. In addition, different criteria for PK bioequivalence will be evaluated to determine which PK bioequivalence criteria should be chosen to satisfy a given criteria for therapeutic bioequivalence between brand and generic. This step will involve simulations of PK and PD of approved brand and generic drugs considered as NTI. The deliverables from this research will be a) decision tree that will incorporate both qualitative and quantitative features for deciding whether a drug belongs to NTI or not b) bioequivalence criteria for NTI drugs incorporating information from PK and therapeutic window of approved brand and generic drugs. Narrative The aim of this research is to utilize pharmacometric approaches to propose objective criteria to designate narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drugs. The project will also evaluate if alternate criteria are necessary for approving a NTI generic to enhance public health.","Subtopic 1 : Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic, dose-toxicity modleing and simulation for narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drugs",8853443,U01FD005188,[' '],FDA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,U01,2014,207980,0.10479881337426908
"The Interdependency of Drug Resistance Evolution and Drug Design: HIV-1 Protease     DESCRIPTION: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies. The pressures of evolution will likely result in a variety of pathways for resistance to evolve. Drug resistance can be caused by a change in the balance of molecular recognition events that selectively weakens inhibitor binding but maintains the biological function of the therapeutic target. To reduce the likelihood of drug resistance, the interdependency of the target's function within the context of the biological system in which it exists must be elucidated. Disrupting the therapeutic target's activity is necessary but not sufficient for avoiding resistance. In this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that key pathways and coupled mechanisms confer drug resistance to therapeutic targets. We seek to define the sequence, structural and dynamic, and temporal evolutionary constraints of the interdependency of drug resistance: 1) to recognize the pathways by which resistance occurs and 2) to devise drug design strategies for developing a drug that is robust against resistance. HIV-1 Protease is the perfect case study! HIV evolves very quickly with on average a point mutation introduced in every third genome replicated. HIV protease inhibitors have the potential of being both very potent and robust to resistance. Protease inhibitors are the only HIV inhibitor class that are transition state analogs and can be evolutionarily constrained within the substrate envelope. Inhibitors that leverage both of these characteristics, such as Darunavir (DRV) and similar analogs, have the potential of being robust, nearly resistance proof inhibitors, to drug- na¿ve HIV infected patients. If HIV achieves resistance to these inhibitors it is only through complex pathways and combinations of mutations. Further elucidating these complex pathways will bring us closer to resistance-proof inhibitors. In this project our team will use and develop cutting-edge technology to follow the pathways of drug resistance selection, to elucidate the molecular basis for their interdependent patterns and incorporate these mechanisms into drug design strategies. Together we will make inroads into tackling drug resistance that would be impossible for any of us to individually achieve         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies.

"Tiered Testing Strategy for Assessing Thermal Effects on Transdermal Products   Many transdermal systems are affected by temperature and are labeled with a warning against heat application. For example, heat can increase skin permeability. Heat can affect drug solubility in a formulation and drug (and excipient) release from the transdermal system. Heat can also increase dermal clearance and systemic drug absorption via the vascular network. Heat effects can be different among different transdermal delivery systems. In the FDA review process, when the reference product has a label warning against heat application, the generic product cannot be more sensitive to heat than the reference product. Different heat effects among transdermal products can be due to different drug release (and formulation release) from the products. In addition, due to the different formulation release under heat, these formulations can exert different effects on skin permeability. The different formulation release and penetration into the dermis can also affect dermal clearance for systemic drug absorption. The objectives of this project are to (a) investigate the in vitro release test conditions for identifying heat effects on transdermal delivery and (b) develop an in vitro test process to be used in the reviews of transdermal products to ensure that generic products do not introduce any additional safety risks. We will evaluate the influence of heat upon the rate of drug release from the patch using in vitro release testing of USP dissolution apparatus (tier 1), drug and formulation permeation across skin using Franz diffusion cells (tier 2), and dermal clearance analyses using an existing, state-of-the-art, skin diffusion model to determine dermis concentration and drug absorption into the vascular network in the dermis (tier 3). It is hypothesize that this tiered in vitro testing strategy will yield a scientifically-based decision tree to support the evaluation of thermal effects for ANDA approvals of transdermal products.   The performance of a transdermal drug delivery system can be affected by temperature and this poses a safety risk. In FDA reviews, heat effect on a generic transdermal product must not be more pronounced than that of the reference (brand name) product. Evidence such as human clinical data to show that the generic product is not less safe than the reference product under the application of heat is required. The present project will develop an in vitro test method for evaluating heat effect on transdermal generic products.",Tiered Testing Strategy for Assessing Thermal Effects on Transdermal Products,8904329,U01FD004942,[' '],FDA,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,U01,2014,249995,0.06659737866163713
"Using Biomedical Knowledge to Identify Plausible Signals for Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need to monitor unintended effects of approved drugs has been highlighted by several recent high-profile events in which fatal side effects of drugs were detected after their release to market. Notoriously, the Cox-2 inhibitor Rofecoxib (Vioxx) was withdrawn from market on account of evidence suggesting that treatment with the drug increased the rate of coronary artery disease, and recently new evidence has emerged suggesting the commonly used antibiotic Azithromycin (Zithromax) may cause fatal arrythmias. In an effort to mitigate the morbidity and mortality resulting from such undetected side effects, regulatory bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have instituted spontaneous reporting systems to systematize post-marketing surveillance. However there is evidence that under-reporting of adverse drug events (ADEs) is widespread. Automated monitoring of events documented in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) as free text or structured data has been proposed as a path toward earlier identification of meaningfully correlated drug-event pairs.

"Using Biomedical Knowledge to Identify Plausible Signals for Pharmacovigilance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need to monitor unintended effects of approved drugs has been highlighted by several recent high-profile events in which fatal side effects of drugs were detected after their release to market. Notoriously, the Cox-2 inhibitor Rofecoxib (Vioxx) was withdrawn from market on account of evidence suggesting that treatment with the drug increased the rate of coronary artery disease, and recently new evidence has emerged suggesting the commonly used antibiotic Azithromycin (Zithromax) may cause fatal arrythmias. In an effort to mitigate the morbidity and mortality resulting from such undetected side effects, regulatory bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have instituted spontaneous reporting systems to systematize post-marketing surveillance. However there is evidence that under-reporting of adverse drug events (ADEs) is widespread. Automated monitoring of events documented in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) as free text or structured data has been proposed as a path toward earlier identification of meaningfully correlated drug-event pairs. As these pairs must ultimately be reviewed by domain experts to assess their implications, there is a pressing need to develop methods to selectively identify plausible drug-event pairs within the large pool of correlations to be found in clinical data.

"Novel Paradigms For Drug Discovery: Computational Multitarget Screening DESCRIPTION  Abstract:  We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique  for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional  structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective  in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates  computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess  for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption,  distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways.  The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be iteratively  refined using machine learning techniques.  We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight  human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is  the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against  these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community.  In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified  their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of  the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus  far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies.  The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted  lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use.  The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive computational drug discovery pipeline, applicable to any  disease, thereby increasing the success rate and reducing the risk, cost, and time associated with traditional  drug discovery methods. This Pioneer award application will focus on the creation and improvement of computational methods to  develop broad spectrum therapeutics against any infectious or inherited disease. Pathogens of focus include  all human herpes viruses (HHVs), which infect billions worldwide every year, with a significant mortality rate in  immunocompromised patients; yet limited therapeutics exist for many of these viruses and virus populations  are becoming resistant to current drugs.

"Mining health data for drug safety profiles     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical trials, which test the safety and efficacy of drugs in a controlled population, cannot identify all safety issues associated with drugs because the size and characteristics of the target population, duration of use, the concomitant disease conditions and therapies differ markedly in actual usage conditions.  On the outpatient side, medication related morbidity and mortality in the United States is estimated to result in 100,000 deaths and $177 billion in cost annually.  On the inpatient side, it is estimated that roughly 30% of hospital stays have an adverse drug event.  Current one-drug-at-a-time methods for surveillance are woefully inadequate because no one monitors the ""real life"" situation of patients getting over 3 concomitant drugs in the context of multiple co-morbidities.  In preliminary work, we have built an annotation and analysis pipeline that uses the knowledge-graph formed by public biomedical ontologies for the purpose data-mining unstructured clinical notes.  We have demonstrated that we can reproduce drug safety signals from the clinical notes on average 2.7 years ahead of the issue of a drug safety alert.  Using  this  pipeline, we  propose:  1)  to identfy and prioritize multi-drug  combinations that are worth testing; 2) to develop methods for discovering adverse event profiles of multi- drug  combinations; and  3)  to  create  an  EHR  derived  catalogue of potential adverse events of multi-drug combinations.  We will use hierarchies provided by existing public ontologies for drugs, diseases and side- effects to improve signal detection by aggregation, to reduce multiple hypothesis testing and to make a search for multi-drug side effects computationally tractable.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to combine data from electronic medical records, adverse event reports in AERS, and prior knowledge in curated knowledgebases to construct a data-driven safety profile for drugs.  Successful development of novel methods will result in significant cost savings as well as a significant increase in patient safety, given the current rat (~30%) of occurrence of adverse drug events.  Completion of the aims will result in the first of it kind, EHR derived, resource of adverse event profiles of drugs.

"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the direct effect on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post- marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA have formed the Observational Medical Outcomes partnership to develop and compare methods for identification of adverse drug events (ADEs), and the FDA has announced its Sentinel Initiative. The proposed work will develop and study machine learning for ADE identification and prediction. The latter, easier task of ADE prediction assumes that an ADE has already been identified -- such as the association between Cox2 inhibitors (Cox2ib) and myocardial infarction (MI) - and the goal is to construct a model that can accurately predict which patients are most susceptible to having the ADE, e.g., having an MI if they take a Cox2 inhibitor. Our preliminary results show that using machine learning we can already make predictions at 75% sensitivity with 75% specificity. The task of ADE identification is more difficult than ADE prediction, because we do not have an observed class variable. Given that a new drug has been placed on the market, this task seeks to determine whether any previously-unanticipated adverse event is caused by the drug. Because we do not know in advance what this event is - it may not even correspond to an existing diagnosis code - this task does not neatly fit into the standard supervised learning paradigm. Our approach is to use reverse machine learning to build a post- marketing surveillance tool in order to predict and/or detect adverse reactions to drugs from electronic medical records (EMRs) or claims data. We show both theoretically and with preliminary empirical results that this approach can discover one or more subgroups of patients who are characterized by previously-unanticipated adverse events - events that patients on the drug suffer at a higher rate than patients not on the drug. These events do not have to correspond to previously-defined ADEs. In order to build and evaluate a machine learning-based system for ADE identification and prediction, this proposal will address the following specific aims: (1) apply supervised machine learning to the task of ADE prediction - predicting which patients are most likely to suffer a known ADE if given the drug; (2) apply reverse machine learning to identify novel ADEs; (3) provide a complete software system for machine learning-based identification and prediction of ADEs. This system will be tested on both the Marshfield Clinic's EMR, some preliminary results of which are presented in this proposal, and on real and synthetic datasets available through the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP).        Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It will further develop and thoroughly evaluate novel machine learning approaches to these difficult tasks.

"Mining Social Network Postings for Mentions of Potential Adverse Drug Reactions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Drugs undergo extensive testing in animals and clinical trials in humans before they are marketed for widespread use in the population. Pre-market testing produces reasonably high quality information about the efficacy of the drug as a treatment for the condition for which it was approved, but gives a very incomplete picture of the drug's safety. Post-marketing surveillance currently relies mainly on voluntary reporting to the FDA by health care professionals (and recently, patients themselves) through MedWatch, the FDA's safety information and adverse event reporting program. Self-reported patient information captures a valuable perspective that has been found to be of similar quality to that provided by health professionals, and currently it is only captured via the formal MedWatch form. The overarching goal of this application is to deploy the infrastructure needed to explore the value of informal social network postings as a source of ""signals"" of potential adverse drug reactions soon after the drugs hit the market, paying particular attention at the value such information might have to detect adverse events earlier than currently possible, and to detect effects not easily captured by traditional means. Despite the significant challenge of processing colloquial text, our prototype study in this direction showed promising performance in identifying adverse reactions mentioned in these postings, with significant correlations between the effects mentioned by the public and those documented for the drugs we studied. Specific aims to be addressed include: 1). To establish the infrastructure that enables processing of online user comments about the drug on health-related social network websites. Particularly, we seek to recognize and extract mentions of adverse effects in those informal postings, and to map them to standard terminology. We will build on our preliminary lexical approach for finding the mentions, and propose a variation of machine learning (commonly referred to as active learning) where the machine learning framework has the ability to control what instances will be selected for use in the training data, among other innovative semantic approaches to normalization (mapping of the mentions to established, formal terms) and sentiment analysis (to discover whether a mention is reporting a positive or a negative effect); 2) To evaluate the  sensitivity and specificity of the extraction and identification systems, as well as the predictive value of the extracted  knowledge through specific case studies of a set of drugs with well known adverse reactions and by monitoring  postings about a select group of drugs released since 2007. Our existing manually annotated gold standard will be  expanded  through  a  dedicated  annotation  effort  led  by  a  pharmacologist (Karen Smith). 3) To compare the  knowledge  extracted  from  patient  comments  to  what  is  derived  from  the  established  drug  safety  monitoring  scheme overseen by the FDA. We recognize that the data obtained through the deployed infrastructure would not be able to be used to define an ADR standing on its own. However, if this method is validated, it could provide useful signals to complement the already established processes and data sources. Narrative  Adverse drug reactions are currently listed as one of the top 10 causes of death in the US. Identifying adverse  effects of drugs after they are publicly marketed depends mainly on voluntary reporting to the FDA by health  care professionals and recently, patients themselves, via a formal online form. The goal of this project is to  develop the tools needed to exploit the numerous informal social network postings that patients make to  health-related social networks such as Daily Strength as a source of ""signals"" of potential adverse drug  reactions soon after the drugs hit the market. These tools could provide useful signals about adverse effects  earlier than currently possible, hastening the FDA's intervention and reducing the impact that an adverse effect  can have on public health.",Mining Social Network Postings for Mentions of Potential Adverse Drug Reactions,8541881,R01LM011176,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Case Study', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical trials in animals', 'cohort', 'drug development', 'drug efficacy', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'non-compliance', 'post-market', 'programs', 'prototype', 'social networking website', 'tool']",NLM,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2013,320208,0.08892615046529566
"Predictive Structure-Based Models of Malaria Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposed effort is to develop predictive models of future Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild, leading to discovery of novel anti-malarial therapeutics againt drug resistant strains in advance of these mutations. Through this SC3 research, we will perform a comprehensive structure-based analysis of DHFR protein evolution in order to generate site-specific predictive models of likely amino acid replacements and identify locations where compensating amino acid replacements may be occurring in response to selection pressures.  Research will commence with generation of a comprehensive phylogenetic tree using DHFR protein sequences obtained from public domain databases. Ancestral sequences will be predicted for key clades in DHFR evolution. 3D homology models will then be generated for each of these ancestral sequences that will be added sequentially to an already existing structure-based sequence alignment generated from a superposition of experimentally determined x-ray crystal structures of wild-type (wt) DHFR from 22 species. Predictive models of site-specific amino acid replacements will be generated using tools and techniques taken from the field of computational intelligence and machine learning that include HMMs and ANNs. These models will be tested and validated by using the first 70% of the phylogeny in order to predict the remaining 30%. Using the insights gained from these predictive models, an analysis will be performed with mutant DHFR sequences of P. falciparum and P. vivax to study the intraspecies differentiation that gave rise to drug resistance. Hypothetical DHFR sequences and homology models representing next steps in Plasmodium DHFR evolution will be generated. In silico docking experiments will be performed with existing anti-malarial drugs as well as known inhibitors of DHFR. Examination of the predicted protein-ligand interactions from these studies will provide additional insights into the acquisition of drug resistance.  Through this proposed effort, an innovative technology for studying and modeling DHFR protein evolution is realized. Predictive models of potential next steps in P. falciparum and P. vivax DHFR evolution will be generated as a proof of concept of this approach. This technology has far-reaching benefits including the generation of hypotheses for intraspecies differentiation and origins of drug resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax as well as the ability to generate predictive models of future DHFR protein evolution providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery before drug resistance develops in the wild.          Approximately forty-one percent of the world's population lives in areas where malaria is transmitted and each year and it is estimated that 350-500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide. Two of the most prevalent malaria strains, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) have developed clinical resistance to antifolate compounds that target the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) such as pyrimethamine and cycloguanil. Consequently, there remains a serious and immediate need for the development of novel antimalarial therapeutics that target drug-resistant strains. Using the proposed approach, we will develop predictive models of future Pf-DHFR and Pv-DHFR protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild. Afterthe completion of this SC3 research, we plan to integrate these predictive models into a comprehensive computational intelligence- based drug discovery platform thus providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery resulting in timely development of novel anti-malarial therapeutics to meet future needs. This approach will be tested on DHFR for novel antimalarial drug discovery; however, the methods developed can be applied broadly in early stage drug discovery and development.

"Mapping the Drugome: predictive network approaches to drug safety surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This application for the K99/R00 ""Pathway to Independence"" program aims to support Dr. Aurel Cami's development into an independent investigator in the field of Biomedical Informatics. The proposed career development period consists of a two-year mentored phase and a three-year independent phase. During the first phase, mentored by Drs. Reis, Kohane, Szolovits, and Manzi, the applicant will obtain formal training in drug safety and in biostatistics/machine learning methods for developing advanced predictive network models. This training will provide the groundwork for the proposed research project. The overall goal of this project is to develop novel surveillance approaches that leverage the inherent network structure of drug safety relationships across the entire drugome in order to predict adverse events earlier and more accurately. The project has four specific aims: 1. Construct and characterize integrated Drug Safety Network representations of the drugome. 2. Develop predictive network models to identify unknown drug-AE associations. 3. Develop predictive network models to identify unknown drug-drug-AE interactions. 4. Systematically evaluate model performance, both retrospectively and prospectively. The preliminary research studies have shown that predictive network models can sensitively and specifically detect drug-AE associations and drug-drug interactions, providing strong motivation for the proposed research. With a background in predictive network modeling and public health drug surveillance, Dr. Cami is highly qualified to conduct the proposed research. This project brings together a broad, interdisciplinary team of mentor, co-mentors and advisors with extensive combined experience in every aspect of the proposed research.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We will use computational methods identify potentiators of mGluR5, compounds that have exciting potential as treatment strategy for schizophrenia. In silico hit compounds will be experimentally validated and enter hit-to-lead optimization.

"Tiered Testing Strategy for Assessing Thermal Effects on Transdermal Products   Many transdermal systems are affected by temperature and are labeled with a warning against heat application. For example, heat can increase skin permeability. Heat can affect drug solubility in a formulation and drug (and excipient) release from the transdermal system. Heat can also increase dermal clearance and systemic drug absorption via the vascular network. Heat effects can be different among different transdermal delivery systems. In the FDA review process, when the reference product has a label warning against heat application, the generic product cannot be more sensitive to heat than the reference product. Different heat effects among transdermal products can be due to different drug release (and formulation release) from the products. In addition, due to the different formulation release under heat, these formulations can exert different effects on skin permeability. The different formulation release and penetration into the dermis can also affect dermal clearance for systemic drug absorption. The objectives of this project are to (a) investigate the in vitro release test conditions for identifying heat effects on transdermal delivery and (b) develop an in vitro test process to be used in the reviews of transdermal products to ensure that generic products do not introduce any additional safety risks. We will evaluate the influence of heat upon the rate of drug release from the patch using in vitro release testing of USP dissolution apparatus (tier 1), drug and formulation permeation across skin using Franz diffusion cells (tier 2), and dermal clearance analyses using an existing, state-of-the-art, skin diffusion model to determine dermis concentration and drug absorption into the vascular network in the dermis (tier 3). It is hypothesize that this tiered in vitro testing strategy will yield a scientifically-based decision tree to support the evaluation of thermal effects for ANDA approvals of transdermal products.   The performance of a transdermal drug delivery system can be affected by temperature and this poses a safety risk. In FDA reviews, heat effect on a generic transdermal product must not be more pronounced than that of the reference (brand name) product. Evidence such as human clinical data to show that the generic product is not less safe than the reference product under the application of heat is required. The present project will develop an in vitro test method for evaluating heat effect on transdermal generic products.",Tiered Testing Strategy for Assessing Thermal Effects on Transdermal Products,8692359,U01FD004942,[' '],FDA,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,U01,2013,494430,0.06659737866163713
"Using Biomedical Knowledge to Identify Plausible Signals for Pharmacovigilance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need to monitor unintended effects of approved drugs has been highlighted by several recent high-profile events in which fatal side effects of drugs were detected after their release to market. Notoriously, the Cox-2 inhibitor Rofecoxib (Vioxx) was withdrawn from market on account of evidence suggesting that treatment with the drug increased the rate of coronary artery disease, and recently new evidence has emerged suggesting the commonly used antibiotic Azithromycin (Zithromax) may cause fatal arrythmias. In an effort to mitigate the morbidity and mortality resulting from such undetected side effects, regulatory bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have instituted spontaneous reporting systems to systematize post-marketing surveillance. However there is evidence that under-reporting of adverse drug events (ADEs) is widespread. Automated monitoring of events documented in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) as free text or structured data has been proposed as a path toward earlier identification of meaningfully correlated drug-event pairs. As these pairs must ultimately be reviewed by domain experts to assess their implications, there is a pressing need to develop methods to selectively identify plausible drug-event pairs within the large pool of correlations to be found in clinical data. In the proposed research, we will develop and evaluate models of biological plausibility, based on knowledge extracted from the biomedical literature and using methods of hyperdimensional computing for efficient search and inference across multiple concepts and relations simultaneously. These methods will be used to selectively identify plausible drug-event pairs found in structured clinical data, and extracted from unstructured data using natural language extraction. The developed methods will be evaluated formatively, for their ability to rediscover known side effects from the biomedical literature, and summatively for their ability to improve the precision of effects attributed to a st of known drugs using statistical methods alone. In addition we will evaluate their ability to predict recent FDA warnings, using historical data and knowledge. If successful, the proposed research will provide the means to identify automatically plausible drug-event pairs for regulatory purposes, mitigating consequent morbidity and mortality. In addition, the methods will provide a generalizable approach that can be used to apply knowledge derived from the biomedical literature to interpret clinical data.              Project Narrative The need to monitor unintended effects of medications has been highlighted by several high-profile events in which fatal side effects of approved drugs were detected after their release to market.

"RESEARCHING THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF A LOCAL METHAMPHETAMINE MARKET    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project investigates a significant feature of the socioenvironmental context of illicit drug use. Directly or indirectly, all users engage the illicit drug economy. Understanding the market roles of producers, consumers, and distributors is critical for prevention, treatment and law enforcement. However, drug markets are dynamic; they continuously adapt to internal and external forces. No theory (or methodology) exists to describe such dynamics. This five-year study develops and systematically field-tests agent-based modeling (ABM) methods to represent consumer, dealer, and health behaviors associated with the methamphetamine market in Cuyahoga and Summit Counties, OH. This approach will provide researchers with an entirely new perspective for observing outcomes of interactive behaviors, as well as the opportunity to perform experiments not possible in the real world. To program simulations, we will characterize roles, motives, behaviors, and interactions of market participants utilizing ethnographic methods (specifically, decision-tree modeling techniques). To validate and extend these data, we will collect quantitative measures of participants' daily behaviors, drug consumption, costs, and interactions using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). We will implement these techniques through a three-wave panel study (N=204); data from the panel study will characterize the sample, inform simulation parameters, and help validate simulation output. Our simulations will subsequently incorporate both descriptive ethnographic data and quantitative longitudinal data so that the behaviors of ""agents"" (simulated people interacting within the virtual market) will accurately reflect the realities of the real-world drug market. The simulation-based computer laboratory produced by this project will offer policymakers and researchers a tool for: (1) dynamically representing illicit drug market operations, (2) experimenting with agent behaviors and market parameters and conditions, and (3) evaluating ""what if"" policy scenarios intended to influence outcomes. Applying Complexity theory by systematically combining the rich detail of ethnography with ABM's power to aggregate socially complex behaviors, this project will have great practical utility. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Conduct ethnographic research on the methamphetamine market in Cuyahoga and Summit Counties, OH. (2) Enrich these data using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), collecting self-report data on daily drug consumption, production, sales, decisions, strategies etc. (3) Inform simulation parameters using a panel survey of 204 active methamphetamine users. (4) Construct a computer lab of ABM simulations reproducing how the local methamphetamine market operates integrating both social (i.e., health) and economic behaviors. (5) Experiment with the ABM simulations to: understand how the market operates and functions; create and test policy-based intervention scenarios (e.g. enforcement, treatment, and outreach) intended to impact outcomes; and model risk behaviors (e.g., needle sharing, trading drugs for sex) influencing the spread of HIV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug users risk behaviors are influenced by the markets in which they acquire drugs. However, these markets are dynamic and reactive which make understanding and modeling this interaction challenging. The objective of this research is to field test a transportable, theoretically informed, and inter-disciplinary research methodology using agent-based simulation to evaluate market dynamics and their impact on methamphetamine distribution and HIV-related risk behaviors.

"Mining health data for drug safety profiles     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical trials, which test the safety and efficacy of drugs in a controlled population, cannot identify all safety issues associated with drugs because the size and characteristics of the target population, duration of use, the concomitant disease conditions and therapies differ markedly in actual usage conditions.  On the outpatient side, medication related morbidity and mortality in the United States is estimated to result in 100,000 deaths and $177 billion in cost annually.  On the inpatient side, it is estimated that roughly 30% of hospital stays have an adverse drug event.  Current one-drug-at-a-time methods for surveillance are woefully inadequate because no one monitors the ""real life"" situation of patients getting over 3 concomitant drugs in the context of multiple co-morbidities.  In preliminary work, we have built an annotation and analysis pipeline that uses the knowledge-graph formed by public biomedical ontologies for the purpose data-mining unstructured clinical notes.  We have demonstrated that we can reproduce drug safety signals from the clinical notes on average 2.7 years ahead of the issue of a drug safety alert.  Using  this  pipeline, we  propose:  1)  to identfy and prioritize multi-drug  combinations that are worth testing; 2) to develop methods for discovering adverse event profiles of multi- drug  combinations; and  3)  to  create  an  EHR  derived  catalogue of potential adverse events of multi-drug combinations.  We will use hierarchies provided by existing public ontologies for drugs, diseases and side- effects to improve signal detection by aggregation, to reduce multiple hypothesis testing and to make a search for multi-drug side effects computationally tractable.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to combine data from electronic medical records, adverse event reports in AERS, and prior knowledge in curated knowledgebases to construct a data-driven safety profile for drugs.  Successful development of novel methods will result in significant cost savings as well as a significant increase in patient safety, given the current rat (~30%) of occurrence of adverse drug events.

"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the direct effect on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post- marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA have formed the Observational Medical Outcomes partnership to develop and compare methods for identification of adverse drug events (ADEs), and the FDA has announced its Sentinel Initiative. The proposed work will develop and study machine learning for ADE identification and prediction. The latter, easier task of ADE prediction assumes that an ADE has already been identified -- such as the association between Cox2 inhibitors (Cox2ib) and myocardial infarction (MI) - and the goal is to construct a model that can accurately predict which patients are most susceptible to having the ADE, e.g., having an MI if they take a Cox2 inhibitor. Our preliminary results show that using machine learning we can already make predictions at 75% sensitivity with 75% specificity. The task of ADE identification is more difficult than ADE prediction, because we do not have an observed class variable. Given that a new drug has been placed on the market, this task seeks to determine whether any previously-unanticipated adverse event is caused by the drug. Because we do not know in advance what this event is - it may not even correspond to an existing diagnosis code - this task does not neatly fit into the standard supervised learning paradigm. Our approach is to use reverse machine learning to build a post- marketing surveillance tool in order to predict and/or detect adverse reactions to drugs from electronic medical records (EMRs) or claims data. We show both theoretically and with preliminary empirical results that this approach can discover one or more subgroups of patients who are characterized by previously-unanticipated adverse events - events that patients on the drug suffer at a higher rate than patients not on the drug. These events do not have to correspond to previously-defined ADEs. In order to build and evaluate a machine learning-based system for ADE identification and prediction, this proposal will address the following specific aims: (1) apply supervised machine learning to the task of ADE prediction - predicting which patients are most likely to suffer a known ADE if given the drug; (2) apply reverse machine learning to identify novel ADEs; (3) provide a complete software system for machine learning-based identification and prediction of ADEs. This system will be tested on both the Marshfield Clinic's EMR, some preliminary results of which are presented in this proposal, and on real and synthetic datasets available through the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP).        Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It will further develop and thoroughly evaluate novel machine learning approaches to these difficult tasks.

"A Study of Social Web Data on Buprenorphine Abuse Using Semantic Web Technology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids has been identified as one of the fastest growing forms of drug abuse in the U.S. There is a critical need to enhance current epidemiological monitoring, early warning, and post-marketing surveillance systems by providing additional and more timely data. The World Wide Web has been identified as one of the ""leading edge"" data sources for detecting patterns and changes in drug use practices. Many websites provide a venue for individuals to freely share their own experiences, post questions, and offer comments about different drugs. Such User Generated Content (UGC) can be used as a very rich data source to study knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to illicit drugs. To harness the full potential of the Web for drug abuse research, the field needs to develop a highly automated way of accessing, extracting, and analyzing Web-based data related to illicit drug use. This exploratory R21 is a multi-principal investigator, collaborative effort between researchers at the Center for Interventions, Treatment and Addictions Research (CITAR) and the Center for Knowledge-Enabled Information Services and Science (Kno.e.sis) at Wright State University. The purpose of this Web-based study is to apply cutting-edge information processing techniques, such as the Semantic Web, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning, to qualitative and quantitative content analysis of user generated content to achieve the following aims: 1) Describe drug users' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to the illicit use of Suboxone(R) (buprenorphine/naloxone) and Subutex(R) (buprenorphine); 2) Identify and describe temporal patterns of the illicit use of these drugs as reflected on web-based forums. To collect data, the study will use websites that allow for the free discussion of illicit drugs, contain information on illicit prescription drug use, and are accessible for public viewing. The study will generate new information about the practices of buprenorphine abuse and will contribute to the advancement of public health and substance abuse research by providing automatic coding and information extraction tools needed to handle rapidly growing Web-based data. Automated information extraction methods applied in this study will enhance current early warning and epidemiological surveillance systems and could advance qualitative and Web-based research methods in other areas of public health.        Building on inter-disciplinary collaboration and cutting-edge information processing techniques, this exploratory, Web-based study will generate new information about Suboxone(R) (buprenorphine/naloxone) and Subutex(R) (buprenorphine) abuse practices, thereby informing public health interventions and policy.

"Mining Social Network Postings for Mentions of Potential Adverse Drug Reactions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Drugs undergo extensive testing in animals and clinical trials in humans before they are marketed for widespread use in the population. Pre-market testing produces reasonably high quality information about the efficacy of the drug as a treatment for the condition for which it was approved, but gives a very incomplete picture of the drug's safety. Post-marketing surveillance currently relies mainly on voluntary reporting to the FDA by health care professionals (and recently, patients themselves) through MedWatch, the FDA's safety information and adverse event reporting program. Self-reported patient information captures a valuable perspective that has been found to be of similar quality to that provided by health professionals, and currently it is only captured via the formal MedWatch form. The overarching goal of this application is to deploy the infrastructure needed to explore the value of informal social network postings as a source of ""signals"" of potential adverse drug reactions soon after the drugs hit the market, paying particular attention at the value such information might have to detect adverse events earlier than currently possible, and to detect effects not easily captured by traditional means. Despite the significant challenge of processing colloquial text, our prototype study in this direction showed promising performance in identifying adverse reactions mentioned in these postings, with significant correlations between the effects mentioned by the public and those documented for the drugs we studied. Specific aims to be addressed include: 1). To establish the infrastructure that enables processing of online user comments about the drug on health-related social network websites. Particularly, we seek to recognize and extract mentions of adverse effects in those informal postings, and to map them to standard terminology. We will build on our preliminary lexical approach for finding the mentions, and propose a variation of machine learning (commonly referred to as active learning) where the machine learning framework has the ability to control what instances will be selected for use in the training data, among other innovative semantic approaches to normalization (mapping of the mentions to established, formal terms) and sentiment analysis (to discover whether a mention is reporting a positive or a negative effect); 2) To evaluate the  sensitivity and specificity of the extraction and identification systems, as well as the predictive value of the extracted  knowledge through specific case studies of a set of drugs with well known adverse reactions and by monitoring  postings about a select group of drugs released since 2007. Our existing manually annotated gold standard will be  expanded  through  a  dedicated  annotation  effort  led  by  a  pharmacologist (Karen Smith). 3) To compare the  knowledge  extracted  from  patient  comments  to  what  is  derived  from  the  established  drug  safety  monitoring  scheme overseen by the FDA. We recognize that the data obtained through the deployed infrastructure would not be able to be used to define an ADR standing on its own. However, if this method is validated, it could provide useful signals to complement the already established processes and data sources. Narrative  Adverse drug reactions are currently listed as one of the top 10 causes of death in the US. Identifying adverse  effects of drugs after they are publicly marketed depends mainly on voluntary reporting to the FDA by health  care professionals and recently, patients themselves, via a formal online form. The goal of this project is to  develop the tools needed to exploit the numerous informal social network postings that patients make to  health-related social networks such as Daily Strength as a source of ""signals"" of potential adverse drug  reactions soon after the drugs hit the market. These tools could provide useful signals about adverse effects  earlier than currently possible, hastening the FDA's intervention and reducing the impact that an adverse effect  can have on public health.",Mining Social Network Postings for Mentions of Potential Adverse Drug Reactions,8222740,R01LM011176,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Case Study', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical trials in animals', 'cohort', 'drug development', 'drug efficacy', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'non-compliance', 'post-market', 'programs', 'prototype', 'social networking website', 'tool']",NLM,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2012,361875,0.08892615046529566
"Predictive Structure-Based Models of Malaria Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposed effort is to develop predictive models of future Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild, leading to discovery of novel anti-malarial therapeutics againt drug resistant strains in advance of these mutations. Through this SC3 research, we will perform a comprehensive structure-based analysis of DHFR protein evolution in order to generate site-specific predictive models of likely amino acid replacements and identify locations where compensating amino acid replacements may be occurring in response to selection pressures.  Research will commence with generation of a comprehensive phylogenetic tree using DHFR protein sequences obtained from public domain databases. Ancestral sequences will be predicted for key clades in DHFR evolution. 3D homology models will then be generated for each of these ancestral sequences that will be added sequentially to an already existing structure-based sequence alignment generated from a superposition of experimentally determined x-ray crystal structures of wild-type (wt) DHFR from 22 species. Predictive models of site-specific amino acid replacements will be generated using tools and techniques taken from the field of computational intelligence and machine learning that include HMMs and ANNs. These models will be tested and validated by using the first 70% of the phylogeny in order to predict the remaining 30%. Using the insights gained from these predictive models, an analysis will be performed with mutant DHFR sequences of P. falciparum and P. vivax to study the intraspecies differentiation that gave rise to drug resistance. Hypothetical DHFR sequences and homology models representing next steps in Plasmodium DHFR evolution will be generated. In silico docking experiments will be performed with existing anti-malarial drugs as well as known inhibitors of DHFR. Examination of the predicted protein-ligand interactions from these studies will provide additional insights into the acquisition of drug resistance.  Through this proposed effort, an innovative technology for studying and modeling DHFR protein evolution is realized. Predictive models of potential next steps in P. falciparum and P. vivax DHFR evolution will be generated as a proof of concept of this approach. This technology has far-reaching benefits including the generation of hypotheses for intraspecies differentiation and origins of drug resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax as well as the ability to generate predictive models of future DHFR protein evolution providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery before drug resistance develops in the wild.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately forty-one percent of the world's population lives in areas where malaria is transmitted and each year and it is estimated that 350-500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide. Two of the most prevalent malaria strains, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) have developed clinical resistance to antifolate compounds that target the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) such as pyrimethamine and cycloguanil. Consequently, there remains a serious and immediate need for the development of novel antimalarial therapeutics that target drug-resistant strains. Using the proposed approach, we will develop predictive models of future Pf-DHFR and Pv-DHFR protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild. Afterthe completion of this SC3 research, we plan to integrate these predictive models into a comprehensive computational intelligence- based drug discovery platform thus providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery resulting in timely development of novel anti-malarial therapeutics to meet future needs. This approach will be tested on DHFR for novel antimalarial drug discovery; however, the methods developed can be applied broadly in early stage drug discovery and development.              Approximately forty-one percent of the world's population lives in areas where malaria is transmitted and each year and it is estimated that 350-500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide.

"NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING    DESCRIPTION   Abstract:   We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways. The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be itera- tively refined using machine learning techniques. We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community. In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies. The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use.

"Mapping the Drugome: predictive network approaches to drug safety surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This application for the K99/R00 ""Pathway to Independence"" program aims to support Dr. Aurel Cami's development into an independent investigator in the field of Biomedical Informatics. The proposed career development period consists of a two-year mentored phase and a three-year independent phase. During the first phase, mentored by Drs. Reis, Kohane, Szolovits, and Manzi, the applicant will obtain formal training in drug safety and in biostatistics/machine learning methods for developing advanced predictive network models. This training will provide the groundwork for the proposed research project. The overall goal of this project is to develop novel surveillance approaches that leverage the inherent network structure of drug safety relationships across the entire drugome in order to predict adverse events earlier and more accurately. The project has four specific aims: 1. Construct and characterize integrated Drug Safety Network representations of the drugome. 2. Develop predictive network models to identify unknown drug-AE associations. 3. Develop predictive network models to identify unknown drug-drug-AE interactions. 4. Systematically evaluate model performance, both retrospectively and prospectively. The preliminary research studies have shown that predictive network models can sensitively and specifically detect drug-AE associations and drug-drug interactions, providing strong motivation for the proposed research. With a background in predictive network modeling and public health drug surveillance, Dr. Cami is highly qualified to conduct the proposed research. This project brings together a broad, interdisciplinary team of mentor, co-mentors and advisors with extensive combined experience in every aspect of the proposed research.           Project Narrative  Some drugs that are approved for sale to the public may have dangerous unknown side-effects. It is important to detect these unknown side effects as soon as possible in order to prevent serious illness or death.

"An automated high throughput phenotypic screen for schistosomiasis drug discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schistosomiasis is a tropical parasitic disease infecting over 200 million people. Treatment relies on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). In the absence of back-up drugs with PZQ's therapeutic spectrum, the risk of resistance to PZQ and eventual drug failure is a major concern. Traditional phenotypic screens, using adult- stage S. mansoni, are low-throughput and incompatible with modern high-throughput screen (HTS) systems. In keeping with the NIAID's mission, the present proposal aims to turn a newly developed, moderate- throughput phenotypic screen (MTS), into a fully automated, quantitative HTS to accelerate drug discovery for this infectious disease. The proposal involves three PIs with ongoing collaborations and respective biological, screening-technology and bio-computational skills who are focused on just this goal. As a first research track for this proposal, we will utilize in-house automation and a high-content screening (HCS) system to significantly increase throughput over our published MTS approach. The proposal will involve; expanding robotic plating of the parasite, developing protocols for bright-field and fluorescence-based microscopy and adapting commercial image-analysis software to identify (segment), quantitatively describe and track the motion of parasites with a view to prioritizing compounds for further pre-clinical development. Because commercial HCS analysis tools are not likely optimized for recording the complex and dynamic phenotypes displayed by this multicellular parasite, we will also pursue a second and parallel track of research. Specifically, we will develop de novo an automated image-analysis screening technology to define, identify, and quantify the range of phenotypic responses (morphological and behavioral) possible in this parasite. Ultimately, both the experimental and computation tracks will together produce a standardized HTS protocol and a comprehensive, quantitative suite of image-analysis programs to categorize parasite phenotypes. Such rigor will facilitate the screening of large numbers of potential compounds and their prioritization into the secondary and tertiary screening assays available in-house. We also intend to make the algorithmic framework including its methods and implementations, publicly available.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major goal of the project is to turn a moderate-throughput phenotypic screen (MTS) system for schistosomiasis, into a fully automated, quantitative high-throughput screen (HTS). By so doing, the rate of discovery of drugs to treat this global tropical disease will be increased.

"Identification of Biomarkers of Cardiotoxicity using Metabolomics of Human Plurip    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiotoxicity, as a result of adverse drug effects, is a serious problem that has yet to be effectively screened prior to patient exposure. Cardiac safety is one of the leading causes of compound attrition in the pharmaceutical industry and withdrawal of FDA-approved drugs from the market. The purpose of this proposal is to alleviate the financial burden of compound attrition due to cardiotoxicity, but more importantly, to improve public health through the development of an in vitro assay to predict a drug's ability to induce cardiotoxicity. Stemina Biomarker Discovery (""Stemina"") proposes to do so through the use of metabolomics on treated cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem (hES) and human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells. These technologies will be used to discover human endogenous small molecule biomarkers which predict cardiotoxicity, with an emphasis on cardiomyopathy. The use of metabolomics to measure small molecules secreted by human cardiomyocytes in response to drugs is a novel approach and may pave the way for a new generation of more accurate predictive toxicology screens. Stemina has already used such a paradigm to develop predictive methods to assess development toxicology in stem cells. Stemina's long-term goal is to fully develop this humanized, high throughput cardiotoxicity screen so that it would be a valuable tool to pharmaceutical and biotech companies during preclinical development of therapeutics. In order to achieve this long term goal, Stemina is first proposing to establish an experimental platform for each cardiomyocyte culture system (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will use these systems to develop a dose response curve for each of the 24 compounds (16 cardiotoxic and 10 non-cardiotoxic) as a training set to establish a predictive metabolomic model. These dose response curves will be used to determine 3 concentrations for drug treatment to be utilized in Aim 3. Stemina will then establish a specific metabolic signature of candidate human biomarkers of drug-induced cardiotoxicity (Aim 3). To do so, human pluripotent stem (hPS) cell-derived cardiomyocytes will be treated with well-established known inducers and non-inducers of cardiotoxiciy. The spent medium from treated cells will be analyzed with mass spectrometry in order to study the secreted metabolites, or secretome, of these cells. Small molecules whose abundances vary dependent upon whether cells were treated with an inducer or non-inducer of cardiotoxicity will serve as candidate biomarkers of cardiotoxicity. In future studies, these candidate biomarkers will be validated through the use of specialized mass spectrometry techniques. Lastly, the ability of these biomarkers to adequately predict cardiotoxicity will be tested through the use of a blind study. Completion of these aims will encourage further discussions with partnering companies in order to develop a kit that can detect the validated biomarkers of cardiotoxicity. Stemina will then utilize this kit to market a service to predict whether or not a compound will induce cardiotoxicity that will serve pharmaceutical companies in pre-clinical screening trials. Such a service will provide the first humanized screening assay for cardiotoxicity based on cardiomyocyte metabolism and will likely improve public health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse effects of drugs to patients are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States; one such an adverse effect is drug-induced cardiotoxicity, illustrating a need for a better predictive assay for cardiotoxicity. Stemina Biomarker Discovery proposes to develop biomarkers of cardiotoxicity that would drive a service model to predict the cardiotoxicity-potential of drug candidates in order to prevent cardiotoxicity in patients. Such a product will greatly improve public health.           Adverse effects of drugs to patients are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States; one such an adverse effect is drug-induced cardiotoxicity, illustrating a need for a better predictive assay for cardiotoxicity.

"Technology to Identify and Assay Chemical Genomic Probes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of this proposal is to develop and deploy cutting edge technologies and chemical genomic tools and to understand the effects of small molecule inhibitors in vivo, and to characterize the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae on a systems level. Over the course of the past 3.5 years, as part of an NHGRI-funded project, we have applied three unique genome-wide screens to ~2,000 chemical inhibitors of growth. These data have led to several notable findings, including: 1) novel drug/target interactions, 2) a chemical phenotype for nearly all yeast genes, 3) a systems-level characterization of yeast, and 4) a better understanding of chemical structure-activity relationships as they manifest in vivo. These data have also guided the design of the next-generation chemical genomic assays proposed herein. Using our established bioinformatics and robotics infrastructure, we will design the next generation of assays to interrogate the genome's interaction with small molecules to unprecedented levels of scrutiny, while decreasing cost per chemical. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Small molecules, the central focus of this proposal, make up the majority of FDA approved drugs. Unfortunately, the pharmaceutical industry is currently experiencing sky-rocketing costs (~800 million dollars per new drug) in addition to steadily decreasing productivity. These struggles are attributed in part to unforeseen side-effects of promising drug candidates and by a lack of validated cellular ""targets"" to which a drug can bind and elicit a medicinal effect. The specific aims of this proposal address both of these problems.           Narrative Small molecules, the central focus of this proposal, make up the majority of FDA approved drugs.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We will use computational methods identify potentiators of mGluR5, compounds that have exciting potential as treatment strategy for schizophrenia. In silico hit compounds will be experimentally validated and enter hit-to-lead optimization.

"RESEARCHING THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF A LOCAL METHAMPHETAMINE MARKET    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project investigates a significant feature of the socioenvironmental context of illicit drug use. Directly or indirectly, all users engage the illicit drug economy. Understanding the market roles of producers, consumers, and distributors is critical for prevention, treatment and law enforcement. However, drug markets are dynamic; they continuously adapt to internal and external forces. No theory (or methodology) exists to describe such dynamics. This five-year study develops and systematically field-tests agent-based modeling (ABM) methods to represent consumer, dealer, and health behaviors associated with the methamphetamine market in Cuyahoga and Summit Counties, OH. This approach will provide researchers with an entirely new perspective for observing outcomes of interactive behaviors, as well as the opportunity to perform experiments not possible in the real world. To program simulations, we will characterize roles, motives, behaviors, and interactions of market participants utilizing ethnographic methods (specifically, decision-tree modeling techniques). To validate and extend these data, we will collect quantitative measures of participants' daily behaviors, drug consumption, costs, and interactions using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). We will implement these techniques through a three-wave panel study (N=204); data from the panel study will characterize the sample, inform simulation parameters, and help validate simulation output. Our simulations will subsequently incorporate both descriptive ethnographic data and quantitative longitudinal data so that the behaviors of ""agents"" (simulated people interacting within the virtual market) will accurately reflect the realities of the real-world drug market. The simulation-based computer laboratory produced by this project will offer policymakers and researchers a tool for: (1) dynamically representing illicit drug market operations, (2) experimenting with agent behaviors and market parameters and conditions, and (3) evaluating ""what if"" policy scenarios intended to influence outcomes. Applying Complexity theory by systematically combining the rich detail of ethnography with ABM's power to aggregate socially complex behaviors, this project will have great practical utility. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Conduct ethnographic research on the methamphetamine market in Cuyahoga and Summit Counties, OH. (2) Enrich these data using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), collecting self-report data on daily drug consumption, production, sales, decisions, strategies etc. (3) Inform simulation parameters using a panel survey of 204 active methamphetamine users. (4) Construct a computer lab of ABM simulations reproducing how the local methamphetamine market operates integrating both social (i.e., health) and economic behaviors. (5) Experiment with the ABM simulations to: understand how the market operates and functions; create and test policy-based intervention scenarios (e.g. enforcement, treatment, and outreach) intended to impact outcomes; and model risk behaviors (e.g., needle sharing, trading drugs for sex) influencing the spread of HIV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug users risk behaviors are influenced by the markets in which they acquire drugs. However, these markets are dynamic and reactive which make understanding and modeling this interaction challenging. The objective of this research is to field test a transportable, theoretically informed, and inter-disciplinary research methodology using agent-based simulation to evaluate market dynamics and their impact on methamphetamine distribution and HIV-related risk behaviors.

"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the direct effect on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post- marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA have formed the Observational Medical Outcomes partnership to develop and compare methods for identification of adverse drug events (ADEs), and the FDA has announced its Sentinel Initiative. The proposed work will develop and study machine learning for ADE identification and prediction. The latter, easier task of ADE prediction assumes that an ADE has already been identified -- such as the association between Cox2 inhibitors (Cox2ib) and myocardial infarction (MI) - and the goal is to construct a model that can accurately predict which patients are most susceptible to having the ADE, e.g., having an MI if they take a Cox2 inhibitor. Our preliminary results show that using machine learning we can already make predictions at 75% sensitivity with 75% specificity. The task of ADE identification is more difficult than ADE prediction, because we do not have an observed class variable. Given that a new drug has been placed on the market, this task seeks to determine whether any previously-unanticipated adverse event is caused by the drug. Because we do not know in advance what this event is - it may not even correspond to an existing diagnosis code - this task does not neatly fit into the standard supervised learning paradigm. Our approach is to use reverse machine learning to build a post- marketing surveillance tool in order to predict and/or detect adverse reactions to drugs from electronic medical records (EMRs) or claims data. We show both theoretically and with preliminary empirical results that this approach can discover one or more subgroups of patients who are characterized by previously-unanticipated adverse events - events that patients on the drug suffer at a higher rate than patients not on the drug. These events do not have to correspond to previously-defined ADEs. In order to build and evaluate a machine learning-based system for ADE identification and prediction, this proposal will address the following specific aims: (1) apply supervised machine learning to the task of ADE prediction - predicting which patients are most likely to suffer a known ADE if given the drug; (2) apply reverse machine learning to identify novel ADEs; (3) provide a complete software system for machine learning-based identification and prediction of ADEs. This system will be tested on both the Marshfield Clinic's EMR, some preliminary results of which are presented in this proposal, and on real and synthetic datasets available through the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It will further develop and thoroughly evaluate novel machine learning approaches to these difficult tasks.              Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money.

"A Study of Social Web Data on Buprenorphine Abuse Using Semantic Web Technology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids has been identified as one of the fastest growing forms of drug abuse in the U.S. There is a critical need to enhance current epidemiological monitoring, early warning, and post-marketing surveillance systems by providing additional and more timely data. The World Wide Web has been identified as one of the ""leading edge"" data sources for detecting patterns and changes in drug use practices. Many websites provide a venue for individuals to freely share their own experiences, post questions, and offer comments about different drugs. Such User Generated Content (UGC) can be used as a very rich data source to study knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to illicit drugs. To harness the full potential of the Web for drug abuse research, the field needs to develop a highly automated way of accessing, extracting, and analyzing Web-based data related to illicit drug use. This exploratory R21 is a multi-principal investigator, collaborative effort between researchers at the Center for Interventions, Treatment and Addictions Research (CITAR) and the Center for Knowledge-Enabled Information Services and Science (Kno.e.sis) at Wright State University. The purpose of this Web-based study is to apply cutting-edge information processing techniques, such as the Semantic Web, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning, to qualitative and quantitative content analysis of user generated content to achieve the following aims: 1) Describe drug users' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to the illicit use of Suboxone(R) (buprenorphine/naloxone) and Subutex(R) (buprenorphine); 2) Identify and describe temporal patterns of the illicit use of these drugs as reflected on web-based forums. To collect data, the study will use websites that allow for the free discussion of illicit drugs, contain information on illicit prescription drug use, and are accessible for public viewing. The study will generate new information about the practices of buprenorphine abuse and will contribute to the advancement of public health and substance abuse research by providing automatic coding and information extraction tools needed to handle rapidly growing Web-based data. Automated information extraction methods applied in this study will enhance current early warning and epidemiological surveillance systems and could advance qualitative and Web-based research methods in other areas of public health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Building on inter-disciplinary collaboration and cutting-edge information processing techniques, this exploratory, Web-based study will generate new information about Suboxone(R) (buprenorphine/naloxone) and Subutex(R) (buprenorphine) abuse practices, thereby informing public health interventions and policy.

"NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING    DESCRIPTION   Abstract:   We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways. The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be itera- tively refined using machine learning techniques. We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community. In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies. The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use. The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive computational drug discovery pipeline, applicable to any disease, thereby increasing the suc       n/a",NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING,8146021,DP1OD006779,"['Adverse effects', 'Award', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Dengue', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Excretory function', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Herpesviridae', 'Human', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Metabolism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Screening procedure', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'absorption', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cost', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'success', 'three dimensional structure']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP1,2011,821700,0.04435721356148634
"Mapping the Drugome: predictive network approaches to drug safety surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This application for the K99/R00 ""Pathway to Independence"" program aims to support Dr. Aurel Cami's development into an independent investigator in the field of Biomedical Informatics. The proposed career development period consists of a two-year mentored phase and a three-year independent phase. During the first phase, mentored by Drs. Reis, Kohane, Szolovits, and Manzi, the applicant will obtain formal training in drug safety and in biostatistics/machine learning methods for developing advanced predictive network models. This training will provide the groundwork for the proposed research project. The overall goal of this project is to develop novel surveillance approaches that leverage the inherent network structure of drug safety relationships across the entire drugome in order to predict adverse events earlier and more accurately. The project has four specific aims: 1. Construct and characterize integrated Drug Safety Network representations of the drugome. 2. Develop predictive network models to identify unknown drug-AE associations. 3. Develop predictive network models to identify unknown drug-drug-AE interactions. 4. Systematically evaluate model performance, both retrospectively and prospectively. The preliminary research studies have shown that predictive network models can sensitively and specifically detect drug-AE associations and drug-drug interactions, providing strong motivation for the proposed research. With a background in predictive network modeling and public health drug surveillance, Dr. Cami is highly qualified to conduct the proposed research.

"Preclinical predictive markers of post-approval drug safety    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The approval and subsequent withdrawal of widely prescribed unsafe drugs affects millions of lives annually. We have recently reported that a Bayesian network model can utilize preclinical, phase I and phase II data to predict phase III safety and efficacy with 78% accuracy. Our approach exceeds pharmaceutical industry performance. Our novel preliminary data demonstrate that identifying post-marketing safety issues independent of drug class is feasible using preclinical data only. Every drug has a unique set of preclinical dose versus primary effect curves and dose versus side effect curves. Our preliminary studies show that quantifiable features of preclinical dose versus primary effect curves predict post-approval safety withdrawal with impressive accuracy. Our objective is to build and distribute preclinical pharmacologic predictive models of post-approval clinical safety. Our specific aims are (1) to identify preclinical dose-effect indicators of post- approval drug safety and (2) to build and distribute preclinical indicator machine-learning models that predict post-approval drug safety. This proposal will deliver an open source drug safety sentinel that is based solely on preclinical data. The potential benefits to society include reduced exposure to unsafe drugs, an indicator for potentially suppressed safety data, and reduced burden on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System and other phase IV surveillance systems.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The approval and subsequent withdrawal of widely prescribed unsafe drugs affects millions of lives annually.

"An automated high throughput phenotypic screen for schistosomiasis drug discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schistosomiasis is a tropical parasitic disease infecting over 200 million people. Treatment relies on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). In the absence of back-up drugs with PZQ's therapeutic spectrum, the risk of resistance to PZQ and eventual drug failure is a major concern. Traditional phenotypic screens, using adult- stage S. mansoni, are low-throughput and incompatible with modern high-throughput screen (HTS) systems. In keeping with the NIAID's mission, the present proposal aims to turn a newly developed, moderate- throughput phenotypic screen (MTS), into a fully automated, quantitative HTS to accelerate drug discovery for this infectious disease. The proposal involves three PIs with ongoing collaborations and respective biological, screening-technology and bio-computational skills who are focused on just this goal. As a first research track for this proposal, we will utilize in-house automation and a high-content screening (HCS) system to significantly increase throughput over our published MTS approach. The proposal will involve; expanding robotic plating of the parasite, developing protocols for bright-field and fluorescence-based microscopy and adapting commercial image-analysis software to identify (segment), quantitatively describe and track the motion of parasites with a view to prioritizing compounds for further pre-clinical development. Because commercial HCS analysis tools are not likely optimized for recording the complex and dynamic phenotypes displayed by this multicellular parasite, we will also pursue a second and parallel track of research. Specifically, we will develop de novo an automated image-analysis screening technology to define, identify, and quantify the range of phenotypic responses (morphological and behavioral) possible in this parasite. Ultimately, both the experimental and computation tracks will together produce a standardized HTS protocol and a comprehensive, quantitative suite of image-analysis programs to categorize parasite phenotypes. Such rigor will facilitate the screening of large numbers of potential compounds and their prioritization into the secondary and tertiary screening assays available in-house. We also intend to make the algorithmic framework including its methods and implementations, publicly available.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major goal of the project is to turn a moderate-throughput phenotypic screen (MTS) system for schistosomiasis, into a fully automated, quantitative high-throughput screen (HTS). By so doing, the rate of discovery of drugs to treat this global tropical disease will be increased.           Project Narrative The major goal of the project is to turn a moderate-throughput phenotypic screen (MTS) system for schistosomiasis, into a fully automated, quantitative high-throughput screen (HTS).

Over the course of the past 3.5 years, as part of an NHGRI-funded project, we have applied three unique genome-wide screens to ~2,000 chemical inhibitors of growth. These data have led to several notable findings, including: 1) novel drug/target interactions, 2) a chemical phenotype for nearly all yeast genes, 3) a systems-level characterization of yeast, and 4) a better understanding of chemical structure-activity relationships as they manifest in vivo. These data have also guided the design of the next-generation chemical genomic assays proposed herein. Using our established bioinformatics and robotics infrastructure, we will design the next generation of assays to interrogate the genome's interaction with small molecules to unprecedented levels of scrutiny, while decreasing cost per chemical. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Small molecules, the central focus of this proposal, make up the majority of FDA approved drugs. Unfortunately, the pharmaceutical industry is currently experiencing sky-rocketing costs (~800 million dollars per new drug) in addition to steadily decreasing productivity. These struggles are attributed in part to unforeseen side-effects of promising drug candidates and by a lack of validated cellular ""targets"" to which a drug can bind and elicit a medicinal effect.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We will use computational methods identify potentiators of mGluR5, compounds that have exciting potential as treatment strategy for schizophrenia.

"RESEARCHING THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF A LOCAL METHAMPHETAMINE MARKET    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project investigates a significant feature of the socioenvironmental context of illicit drug use. Directly or indirectly, all users engage the illicit drug economy. Understanding the market roles of producers, consumers, and distributors is critical for prevention, treatment and law enforcement. However, drug markets are dynamic; they continuously adapt to internal and external forces. No theory (or methodology) exists to describe such dynamics. This five-year study develops and systematically field-tests agent-based modeling (ABM) methods to represent consumer, dealer, and health behaviors associated with the methamphetamine market in Cuyahoga and Summit Counties, OH. This approach will provide researchers with an entirely new perspective for observing outcomes of interactive behaviors, as well as the opportunity to perform experiments not possible in the real world. To program simulations, we will characterize roles, motives, behaviors, and interactions of market participants utilizing ethnographic methods (specifically, decision-tree modeling techniques). To validate and extend these data, we will collect quantitative measures of participants' daily behaviors, drug consumption, costs, and interactions using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). We will implement these techniques through a three-wave panel study (N=204); data from the panel study will characterize the sample, inform simulation parameters, and help validate simulation output. Our simulations will subsequently incorporate both descriptive ethnographic data and quantitative longitudinal data so that the behaviors of ""agents"" (simulated people interacting within the virtual market) will accurately reflect the realities of the real-world drug market. The simulation-based computer laboratory produced by this project will offer policymakers and researchers a tool for: (1) dynamically representing illicit drug market operations, (2) experimenting with agent behaviors and market parameters and conditions, and (3) evaluating ""what if"" policy scenarios intended to influence outcomes. Applying Complexity theory by systematically combining the rich detail of ethnography with ABM's power to aggregate socially complex behaviors, this project will have great practical utility. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Conduct ethnographic research on the methamphetamine market in Cuyahoga and Summit Counties, OH. (2) Enrich these data using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), collecting self-report data on daily drug consumption, production, sales, decisions, strategies etc. (3) Inform simulation parameters using a panel survey of 204 active methamphetamine users. (4) Construct a computer lab of ABM simulations reproducing how the local methamphetamine market operates integrating both social (i.e., health) and economic behaviors. (5) Experiment with the ABM simulations to: understand how the market operates and functions; create and test policy-based intervention scenarios (e.g. enforcement, treatment, and outreach) intended to impact outcomes; and model risk behaviors (e.g., needle sharing, trading drugs for sex) influencing the spread of HIV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug users risk behaviors are influenced by the markets in which they acquire drugs. However, these markets are dynamic and reactive which make understanding and modeling this interaction challenging. The objective of this research is to field test a transportable, theoretically informed, and inter-disciplinary research methodology using agent-based simulation to evaluate market dynamics and their impact on methamphetamine distribution and HIV-related risk behaviors.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Drug users risk behaviors are influenced by the markets in which they acquire drugs.

"Towards Automatically Discovering Adverse Drug Effects from User Generated Conten    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ADE Discoverer is an initiative to harvest adverse drug effects (ADEs) casually reported in forum discussions, user reviews, and other social media. Initially, the Discoverer will focus on a limited number of health-care related websites; however, as Phase I progresses there will be a focus on implementing techniques of automatic pattern recognition to allow structured data extraction from additional unknown websites. Once relevant social media is extracted, the Discoverer must then identify any occurrences of adverse drug effects. This is particularly challenging in forum discussions, where members are often discussing well known side effects, or their distinct experiences with multiple drugs in the context of a single post. In order to recognize which adverse effect terms were actually experienced as the result of the commenter taking a drug, a series of machine-learning algorithm based classifiers have been proposed. The classifiers will create classification models based on training data provided by the manual identification of ADEs over thousands of human reviewed posts. In Phase I and beyond, a constant focus will be on improving the ability to recognize human-experienced ADEs in social media. The side effects that pass through the classification filter will be correlated with FDA-reported side effects in order to power the ADE Search and Analysis Workbench. Using the interactive ADE Workbench, researchers will be able to quickly gain the insights necessary to make informed decisions about medications. Publicly available components of the workbench include: total side effect reports by drug, drill-down functionality to view raw, relevant social media and medical reports, and a drug comparison application to compare similar drugs effectiveness and likelihood of side effects side-by-side.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the 2010 Omnibus Solicitation the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has identified several research and development opportunities that directly correspond to the work accomplished by the ADE Discoverer. Among the most relevant opportunities include: ""Develop methods for timely active surveillance of newly approved drug products in large populations to identify both expected and unexpected outcomes."", and ""Develop methods for actively collecting information on all cases of classically drug-associated events to augment the FDA's current passive surveillance system.""

"NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING    DESCRIPTION   Abstract:   We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways. The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be itera- tively refined using machine learning techniques. We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community. In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies. The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use.

"Preclinical predictive markers of post-approval drug safety    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The approval and subsequent withdrawal of widely prescribed unsafe drugs affects millions of lives annually. We have recently reported that a Bayesian network model can utilize preclinical, phase I and phase II data to predict phase III safety and efficacy with 78% accuracy. Our approach exceeds pharmaceutical industry performance. Our novel preliminary data demonstrate that identifying post-marketing safety issues independent of drug class is feasible using preclinical data only. Every drug has a unique set of preclinical dose versus primary effect curves and dose versus side effect curves. Our preliminary studies show that quantifiable features of preclinical dose versus primary effect curves predict post-approval safety withdrawal with impressive accuracy. Our objective is to build and distribute preclinical pharmacologic predictive models of post-approval clinical safety. Our specific aims are (1) to identify preclinical dose-effect indicators of post- approval drug safety and (2) to build and distribute preclinical indicator machine-learning models that predict post-approval drug safety. This proposal will deliver an open source drug safety sentinel that is based solely on preclinical data. The potential benefits to society include reduced exposure to unsafe drugs, an indicator for potentially suppressed safety data, and reduced burden on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System and other phase IV surveillance systems.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The approval and subsequent withdrawal of widely prescribed unsafe drugs affects millions of lives annually.

"Internet Monitoring Of Prescription Drug Abuse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II application continues development of the Pharmaceutical Risk Internet Surveillance Monitor (PRISM), an innovative approach to postmarketing surveillance of indicators suggesting diversion/abuse of opioid pharmaceutical agents. Public health relevance of PRISM includes providing reliable and timely data to allow health, law enforcement, industry, and community leaders take steps to limit potential damage associated with an outbreak of pharmaceutical drug abuse. PRISM will be the first, systematically developed and hybrid or partially automated Internet monitoring service to track, at a product-specific level, the chatter of recreational users of pharmaceutical analgesics as they discuss their use/abuse of such drugs. Those who abuse prescription opioids have open access to Web sites, providing an unvarnished picture of users' communications about these drugs, including ideas and beliefs about the drugs as well as discussions of trends and preferences. Thus, Internet monitoring of drug-related messages may be useful for anticipating an increased risk of an abuse outbreak. The potential of these Internet data has not been exploited in a systematic manner to inform drug policy and planning. In Phase I, collaboration with software developers of MIT's General Inquirer (GI) explored the contributions of automated natural language processing methods to the unstructured, fragmented, but revealing messages posted by the online community of substance abusers. Reliable codes were achieved by human coders, supporting the feasibility of classifying content of Internet posts into meaningful categories of endorsing and discouraging abuse of different products. Completely automating such coding may be as yet out of reach. Furthermore, such codes may not have been the most meaningful qualitative information to draw from the posts. However, the overall level of chatter, based on counts of mentions of specific products, did appear to relate to measures of the attractiveness for abuse of target products. There are significant benefits of archiving such posts, using computer processing of raw posts to prep them for human coders, and searching among thousands of archived posts for selected topics of interest (e.g., sources, extraction methods, adverse events, etc.). In Phase II, we will (1) develop software to find, harvest, and archive posts from eligible Web sites for subsequent analyses, (2) refine the nature and types of qualitative questions, (3) develop and test methods of using automated processing of raw posts to improve the reliability and efficiency of human coding, (4) continue exploration of methods to enhance automation of message coding, (5) refine automated data mining of posts discussions on specific topics including (extraction, sources of drug, extreme reactions, etc.) to target drugs, and (6) test external validity of data collected by PRISM. Given the extraordinary financial implications for pharmaceutical companies needing to demonstrate to the FDA that they have an adequate Risk Minimization Action Plan prior to approval for new, potentially addictive medications, a tool like PRISM holds remarkable commercial appeal.                      Public Health Relevance: A system like PRISM to monitor the chatter about abusable substances on Internet is widely recognized as having extraordinary public health importance by the FDA, DEA, and pharmaceutical companies. Ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of abuse trends detected from these Internet sources will be essential to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health programs, closely integrated with timely dissemination of these data to those responsible for prevention and control.             n/a",Internet Monitoring Of Prescription Drug Abuse,8023201,R44DA020279,"['Accounting', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Analgesics', 'Archives', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Belief', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Evaluation', 'Government', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Oxycodone', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population Surveillance', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Site', 'Source', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Waxes', 'authority', 'base', 'data mining', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'opioid abuse', 'preference', 'prescription drug abuse', 'prescription opioid abuse', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'software development', 'substance abuser', 'tool', 'trend', 'web site']",NIDA,"INFLEXXION, INC.",R44,2010,60592,0.046303603784933506
"An automated high throughput phenotypic screen for schistosomiasis drug discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schistosomiasis is a tropical parasitic disease infecting over 200 million people. Treatment relies on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). In the absence of back-up drugs with PZQ's therapeutic spectrum, the risk of resistance to PZQ and eventual drug failure is a major concern. Traditional phenotypic screens, using adult- stage S. mansoni, are low-throughput and incompatible with modern high-throughput screen (HTS) systems. In keeping with the NIAID's mission, the present proposal aims to turn a newly developed, moderate- throughput phenotypic screen (MTS), into a fully automated, quantitative HTS to accelerate drug discovery for this infectious disease. The proposal involves three PIs with ongoing collaborations and respective biological, screening-technology and bio-computational skills who are focused on just this goal. As a first research track for this proposal, we will utilize in-house automation and a high-content screening (HCS) system to significantly increase throughput over our published MTS approach. The proposal will involve; expanding robotic plating of the parasite, developing protocols for bright-field and fluorescence-based microscopy and adapting commercial image-analysis software to identify (segment), quantitatively describe and track the motion of parasites with a view to prioritizing compounds for further pre-clinical development. Because commercial HCS analysis tools are not likely optimized for recording the complex and dynamic phenotypes displayed by this multicellular parasite, we will also pursue a second and parallel track of research. Specifically, we will develop de novo an automated image-analysis screening technology to define, identify, and quantify the range of phenotypic responses (morphological and behavioral) possible in this parasite. Ultimately, both the experimental and computation tracks will together produce a standardized HTS protocol and a comprehensive, quantitative suite of image-analysis programs to categorize parasite phenotypes. Such rigor will facilitate the screening of large numbers of potential compounds and their prioritization into the secondary and tertiary screening assays available in-house. We also intend to make the algorithmic framework including its methods and implementations, publicly available.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major goal of the project is to turn a moderate-throughput phenotypic screen (MTS) system for schistosomiasis, into a fully automated, quantitative high-throughput screen (HTS).

Three fundamental types of correlations form the basis of drug resistance knowledge: (1) Correlations between genotypic data with the treatments of persons from whom sequenced HIV-1 isolates have been obtained (genotype-treatment); (2) Correlations between genotype and in vitro drug susceptibility (genotype-phenotype); and (3) Correlations between genotype and the clinical response to a new treatment regimen (genotype-outcome). Accordingly our three plans are as follows: (1) To use phylogenetically-based statistical analysis of correlations between mutations in the targets of HIV therapy (genotype) and antiretroviral treatment to distinguish between drug- and non-drug- related HIV-1 evolution, to identify temporal and geographic patterns in the prevalence of drug resistance, and to identify the spread of viruses with particular patterns of drug-resistance mutations. (2) To use patterns of mutations in the targets of antiretroviral therapy, antiretroviral treatment data, and in vitro drug susceptibility results to help prioritize the clinical development of experimental antiretroviral compounds. (3) To us correlations between genotype-phenotype and genotype-clinical outcome to identify the treatment regimens most likely to be effective in persons with acquired or transmitted drug resistance. In order to accomplish these aims, we will expand the online publicly available Stanford HIV RT and Protease Sequence Database to represent, store, and analyze the diverse forms of data underlying drug resistance knowledge. Standardized protocols for exchanging data with the broad community of researchers studying HIV-1 drug resistance will be refined and validated. Improved methods for representing published drug resistance data, performing temporal queries and knowledge discovery, and for analyzing genotypic resistance data in a phylogenetic context will be implemented. This proposal is also the start of a three-way collaboration between Stanford University, the University College of London (UCL), and Oxford University. UCL is on the forefront of research into the problem of transmitted drug resistance and Oxford University is on the forefront of research on virus evolution and population genetics.           n/a",Public HIV Drug Resistance Database,7883346,R01AI068581,"['Acute', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Back', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug Design', 'Drug resistance', 'Evolution', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'HIV', 'HIV drug resistance', 'HIV therapy', 'HIV-1', 'HIV-1 drug resistance', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'London', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Population Dynamics', 'Population Genetics', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Recombinants', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Work', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'college', 'data exchange', 'fitness', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'non-drug', 'resistance mutation', 'response', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,629751,0.019234147240268933
"Technology to Identify and Assay Chemical Genomic Probes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of this proposal is to develop and deploy cutting edge technologies and chemical genomic tools and to understand the effects of small molecule inhibitors in vivo, and to characterize the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae on a systems level.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We will use computational methods identify potentiators of mGluR5, compounds that have exciting potential as treatment strategy for schizophrenia.

"Mining Internet Conversation For Evidence Of Herbal Association    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mining Internet Conversations for Evidence of Herbal-Associated Adverse Events Abstract This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10), Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-102: Informatics for Post- Marketing Surveillance. Often, users of online resources such as discussion boards seek advice about topics they are hesitant to discuss with providers. One such topic is the use of herbal supplements. Relatively little is known about the use and effects of these supplements, primarily due to patient and provider reticence, but also owing to the lack of a formal reporting mechanism. As a result, adverse events and interactions possibly related to herbal use are difficult to evaluate in a population-based investigation. The potential impact for monitoring side effects and adverse events associated with herbal use as well as prescription drug interactions with herbals is highly important. The goal of this project is to develop, apply, and evaluate computational intelligence tools for mining conversational text for evidence of adverse events and side effects of herbals and prescription drugs reported by users of online communication resources relating to breast and prostate cancer. This project will use these informatics tools as the cornerstone of a new approach to post-marketing surveillance, and has been determined by the National Library of Medicine to be responsive to the stated Challenge Topic. This project will be conducted at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, which contributes substantially to the local economy. In 2008, the School created 37,000 jobs and $5.4 billion in regional economic activity. This project will create or retain eight jobs. The School's ability to fill these positions is evident: in 2008, Penn received more than 24,600 applications for just 840 open staff research positions. Mining Internet Conversations for Evidence of Herbal-Associated Adverse Events There has been increasing discussion about the use of herbals with the advent of online resources such as message boards, blogs, and chat rooms. In mining the text from such online, new information about side effects and adverse events associated with herbal use as well as prescription drug interactions with herbals will be discovered. This is highly important for the health of the public, as it stands to create the framework for an herbal sentinel network system.              Mining Internet Conversations for Evidence of Herbal-Associated Adverse Events There has been increasing discussion about the use of herbals with the advent of online resources such as message boards, blogs, and chat rooms.

"RESEARCHING THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF A LOCAL METHAMPHETAMINE MARKET    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project investigates a significant feature of the socioenvironmental context of illicit drug use. Directly or indirectly, all users engage the illicit drug economy. Understanding the market roles of producers, consumers, and distributors is critical for prevention, treatment and law enforcement. However, drug markets are dynamic; they continuously adapt to internal and external forces. No theory (or methodology) exists to describe such dynamics. This five-year study develops and systematically field-tests agent-based modeling (ABM) methods to represent consumer, dealer, and health behaviors associated with the methamphetamine market in Cuyahoga and Summit Counties, OH. This approach will provide researchers with an entirely new perspective for observing outcomes of interactive behaviors, as well as the opportunity to perform experiments not possible in the real world. To program simulations, we will characterize roles, motives, behaviors, and interactions of market participants utilizing ethnographic methods (specifically, decision-tree modeling techniques). To validate and extend these data, we will collect quantitative measures of participants' daily behaviors, drug consumption, costs, and interactions using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). We will implement these techniques through a three-wave panel study (N=204); data from the panel study will characterize the sample, inform simulation parameters, and help validate simulation output. Our simulations will subsequently incorporate both descriptive ethnographic data and quantitative longitudinal data so that the behaviors of ""agents"" (simulated people interacting within the virtual market) will accurately reflect the realities of the real-world drug market. The simulation-based computer laboratory produced by this project will offer policymakers and researchers a tool for: (1) dynamically representing illicit drug market operations, (2) experimenting with agent behaviors and market parameters and conditions, and (3) evaluating ""what if"" policy scenarios intended to influence outcomes. Applying Complexity theory by systematically combining the rich detail of ethnography with ABM's power to aggregate socially complex behaviors, this project will have great practical utility. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Conduct ethnographic research on the methamphetamine market in Cuyahoga and Summit Counties, OH. (2) Enrich these data using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), collecting self-report data on daily drug consumption, production, sales, decisions, strategies etc. (3) Inform simulation parameters using a panel survey of 204 active methamphetamine users. (4) Construct a computer lab of ABM simulations reproducing how the local methamphetamine market operates integrating both social (i.e., health) and economic behaviors. (5) Experiment with the ABM simulations to: understand how the market operates and functions; create and test policy-based intervention scenarios (e.g. enforcement, treatment, and outreach) intended to impact outcomes; and model risk behaviors (e.g., needle sharing, trading drugs for sex) influencing the spread of HIV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug users risk behaviors are influenced by the markets in which they acquire drugs. However, these markets are dynamic and reactive which make understanding and modeling this interaction challenging. The objective of this research is to field test a transportable, theoretically informed, and inter-disciplinary research methodology using agent-based simulation to evaluate market dynamics and their impact on methamphetamine distribution and HIV-related risk behaviors.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Drug users risk behaviors are influenced by the markets in which they acquire drugs.

"Elucidation of Leukocyte and Macrophage Biomarker Signatures from Drugs of Abuse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elucidation of Leukocyte and Macrophage Biomarker Signatures from Drugs of Abuse Project Summary/Abstract. Drugs of abuse are metabolized by the cells of the body including macrophages and leukocytes. Macrophages are primarily responsible for the detection, phagocytosis and digestion of toxins in the bloodstream and peripheral tissues. Normal cellular metabolism of macrophages and other cells are permanently affected by the presence of toxins in the blood which may include illicit substances such as cocaine and alcohol. We propose to study macrophages and other blood cells from normal and cocaine addicted rats and mice in automated, high-throughput biomicroelectromechanical systems (BioMEMS) coupled to ion mobility mass spectrometers and obtain comprehensive measurements of metabolic precursors, products and signaling molecules in real time. We will analyze the wide-spectrum of temporally varying biochemical signature of the living cells before and during exposure to precise doses of cocaine and alcohol administered to cells in the traps using automatic inference of mathematical models. We hypothesize that the resulting metabolic models and biochemical signatures from the cells of addicted animals and normal animals will differ significantly due to permanent alterations in cell physiology brought about by prior exposure. Passive observations and those made during simple interventions can tell much about the response of the cells to a drug or toxin, but the specification of many of the interlocking and nonlinear control systems of individual cells is hidden by the very nature of closed-loop control and requires experiments that measure very large numbers of variables. The automated inference presents daunting challenges that cannot be addressed by a single discipline and hence signifies an exciting frontier for interdisciplinary research. A group of biomedical, chemical and computer engineers, chem- ists, molecular biologists and physicists at Vanderbilt, Cornell, Duke and CFD Research Corporation, propose to merge their talents and optimize computer-controlled nanoliter bioreactors that would use optical, electrical, and electrochemical sensors, two-dimensional mass spectrometry, and novel computer algorithms to design and conduct experiments on small populations of living cells. The goal of this work is to automatically infer the underlying nonlinear dynamical equations governing the behavior of the cells and their environment in the presence and absence of cocaine and alcohol. We will address this challenge by applying Cornell's Symbolic Regression and Exploration-Estimation Algorithms that use in silico coevolution of both the model and tests of the model to experimentally determine which conditions are best suited for further evolution. Our suite of micro- fabricated BioMEMS nanobioreactors, dynamic sensors, and cellular control technologies ensures that we will have adequate dynamical data to create sophisticated metabolic and signaling models of macrophages and leukocytes. This research will have a unique and remarkable educational, intellectual, medical and societal value. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work will impact public health by more accurately characterizing drug abuse and the history of drug abuse in individuals so as to tailor methods of intervention and treatment strategies on a case-by-case basis, thereby increasing the effectiveness of assisting addicted individuals in relinquishing drug-seeking behavior. This approach aims to decrease long-term medical costs associated with prolonged drug and alcohol abuse using a novel approach in the identification of off target leukocyte and macrophage biomarker signatures for rapid and reliable diagnostics of drug use/abuse history. The technology developed will be utilized to gain further understanding of the underlying biological pathways that control addictive behav- ior, which is the first step to addressing destructive behavior on the personal level.           Project Narrative.

"Predicting Reactions of Xenobiotic Compounds in Mammals    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In pursuit of novel therapeutics, drug developers are scanning more compounds and covering more chemical space than ever before. The time required to bring a new drug into the market has not decreased, though the cost for drug discovery is steadily increasing. The root causes of this problem are related to efficacy, toxicity, and inappropriate absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, as shown by recent rigorous analyses. To focus on the ADMET(Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination and Toxicity) issues, pharmaceutical research groups have, since the late 1990s, moved various physicochemical property screens earlier in the drug discovery process. The metabolic transformations of pharmaceuticals profoundly impact their bioavailability, efficacy, chronic toxicity, metabolic idiosyncrasies, excretion rates and routes. Metabolism is one of the major hurdles to overcome. In silico tools enable fast and virtual screening of large numbers of compounds before compounds are synthesized. Such tools enable researchers to recognize complicated metabolic processes, to eliminate poor candidates, and then to use the knowledge gained to discern possible deficiencies in compounds. Still poorly understood, metabolism is the most difficult to predict. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a system to predict xenobiotic metabolism in mammals, and to gain insights into metabolism mechanisms (aim 1), and to study the differences in metabolism between humans and model animals (aim 2). We will use MDL's Metabolite database as a source of information about drug metabolism reactions. For aim 1, we will develop both global metabolism prediction systems, which can be applied to diverse substrate without prior knowledge of enzymes, and local models for particular enzymes, when prior knowledge of the enzymes involved in reactions is available. Global metabolism prediction systems will comprise many individual models, each of which will focus on an animal species (e.g., humans), an enzyme (e.g., CYP3A4) and a specific biotransformation (e.g., hydroxylation). Machine learning techniques will be used to build each individual model using various features to characterize the chemical environments of functional groups within molecules. For local models for an enzyme, we assume that the tight binding of ligands and enzymes is not required, but rather that reactions occur at sites where enzymes can easily attack. We will design ways to model the probability that a particular site will be attacked by enzymes. In Aim 1, both the global metabolism prediction system and the local models are trained on human reactions, so the models are animal specific. In Aim 2, we will build models for rat, which is a model animal in drug development. Using rat reactions listed in MDL's Metabolite database, we will establish a global metabolism system for rats and local models for rats using the same methods outlined in Aim 1. Though the methods are the same, the training sets are different, and it is expected that the models will make different predictions. By using drugs that are known to be metabolized differently in humans and rats, we will study differences in the human and rat models. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In pursuit of novel therapeutics, drug developers are scanning more compounds and covering more chemical space than ever before. ADMET(Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination and Toxicity) has assumed center stage in the drug discovery process. Predicting metabolism is one of the major challenges to be met, and metabolism is the most poorly understood of the ADMET processes, and the most difficult to predict. We propose a machine learning approach for improving metabolism prediction, and for gaining insights into metabolism mechanisms, as well as studying differences in metabolism between humans and model animals.             n/a",Predicting Reactions of Xenobiotic Compounds in Mammals,7684034,R21ES016920,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'CYP3A4 gene', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Computer Simulation', 'Databases', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug toxicity', 'Drug usage', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Excretory function', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hydroxylation', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Marketing', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Biotransformation', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plant Roots', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Site', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Xenobiotic Metabolism', 'Xenobiotics', 'absorption', 'cost', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug metabolism', 'enzyme model', 'functional group', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'meetings', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'public health relevance', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIEHS,LOS ALAMOS NAT SECTY-LOS ALAMOS NAT LAB,R21,2009,306310,0.04170385587752325
"Preclinical predictive markers of post-approval drug safety    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The approval and subsequent withdrawal of widely prescribed unsafe drugs affects millions of lives annually. We have recently reported that a Bayesian network model can utilize preclinical, phase I and phase II data to predict phase III safety and efficacy with 78% accuracy. Our approach exceeds pharmaceutical industry performance. Our novel preliminary data demonstrate that identifying post-marketing safety issues independent of drug class is feasible using preclinical data only. Every drug has a unique set of preclinical dose versus primary effect curves and dose versus side effect curves. Our preliminary studies show that quantifiable features of preclinical dose versus primary effect curves predict post-approval safety withdrawal with impressive accuracy. Our objective is to build and distribute preclinical pharmacologic predictive models of post-approval clinical safety. Our specific aims are (1) to identify preclinical dose-effect indicators of post- approval drug safety and (2) to build and distribute preclinical indicator machine-learning models that predict post-approval drug safety. This proposal will deliver an open source drug safety sentinel that is based solely on preclinical data. The potential benefits to society include reduced exposure to unsafe drugs, an indicator for potentially suppressed safety data, and reduced burden on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System and other phase IV surveillance systems.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The approval and subsequent withdrawal of widely prescribed unsafe drugs affects millions of lives annually.

"Internet Monitoring Of Prescription Drug Abuse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II application continues development of the Pharmaceutical Risk Internet Surveillance Monitor (PRISM), an innovative approach to postmarketing surveillance of indicators suggesting diversion/abuse of opioid pharmaceutical agents. Public health relevance of PRISM includes providing reliable and timely data to allow health, law enforcement, industry, and community leaders take steps to limit potential damage associated with an outbreak of pharmaceutical drug abuse. PRISM will be the first, systematically developed and hybrid or partially automated Internet monitoring service to track, at a product-specific level, the chatter of recreational users of pharmaceutical analgesics as they discuss their use/abuse of such drugs. Those who abuse prescription opioids have open access to Web sites, providing an unvarnished picture of users' communications about these drugs, including ideas and beliefs about the drugs as well as discussions of trends and preferences. Thus, Internet monitoring of drug-related messages may be useful for anticipating an increased risk of an abuse outbreak. The potential of these Internet data has not been exploited in a systematic manner to inform drug policy and planning. In Phase I, collaboration with software developers of MIT's General Inquirer (GI) explored the contributions of automated natural language processing methods to the unstructured, fragmented, but revealing messages posted by the online community of substance abusers. Reliable codes were achieved by human coders, supporting the feasibility of classifying content of Internet posts into meaningful categories of endorsing and discouraging abuse of different products. Completely automating such coding may be as yet out of reach. Furthermore, such codes may not have been the most meaningful qualitative information to draw from the posts. However, the overall level of chatter, based on counts of mentions of specific products, did appear to relate to measures of the attractiveness for abuse of target products. There are significant benefits of archiving such posts, using computer processing of raw posts to prep them for human coders, and searching among thousands of archived posts for selected topics of interest (e.g., sources, extraction methods, adverse events, etc.). In Phase II, we will (1) develop software to find, harvest, and archive posts from eligible Web sites for subsequent analyses, (2) refine the nature and types of qualitative questions, (3) develop and test methods of using automated processing of raw posts to improve the reliability and efficiency of human coding, (4) continue exploration of methods to enhance automation of message coding, (5) refine automated data mining of posts discussions on specific topics including (extraction, sources of drug, extreme reactions, etc.) to target drugs, and (6) test external validity of data collected by PRISM. Given the extraordinary financial implications for pharmaceutical companies needing to demonstrate to the FDA that they have an adequate Risk Minimization Action Plan prior to approval for new, potentially addictive medications, a tool like PRISM holds remarkable commercial appeal.                      Public Health Relevance: A system like PRISM to monitor the chatter about abusable substances on Internet is widely recognized as having extraordinary public health importance by the FDA, DEA, and pharmaceutical companies. Ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of abuse trends detected from these Internet sources will be essential to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health programs, closely integrated with timely dissemination of these data to those responsible for prevention and control.             n/a",Internet Monitoring Of Prescription Drug Abuse,7662246,R44DA020279,"['Accounting', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Analgesics', 'Archives', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Belief', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Evaluation', 'Government', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Oxycodone', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population Surveillance', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Site', 'Source', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Waxes', 'authority', 'base', 'data mining', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'opioid abuse', 'preference', 'prescription drug abuse', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'software development', 'substance abuser', 'tool', 'trend', 'web site']",NIDA,"INFLEXXION, INC.",R44,2009,375502,0.046303603784933506
"Public HIV Drug Resistance Database    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV drug resistance data are critical for HIV drug resistance surveillance, antiretroviral drug design, and the management of persons infected with drug-resistant HIV. Three fundamental types of correlations form the basis of drug resistance knowledge: (1) Correlations between genotypic data with the treatments of persons from whom sequenced HIV-1 isolates have been obtained (genotype-treatment); (2) Correlations between genotype and in vitro drug susceptibility (genotype-phenotype); and (3) Correlations between genotype and the clinical response to a new treatment regimen (genotype-outcome). Accordingly our three plans are as follows: (1) To use phylogenetically-based statistical analysis of correlations between mutations in the targets of HIV therapy (genotype) and antiretroviral treatment to distinguish between drug- and non-drug- related HIV-1 evolution, to identify temporal and geographic patterns in the prevalence of drug resistance, and to identify the spread of viruses with particular patterns of drug-resistance mutations. (2) To use patterns of mutations in the targets of antiretroviral therapy, antiretroviral treatment data, and in vitro drug susceptibility results to help prioritize the clinical development of experimental antiretroviral compounds. (3) To us correlations between genotype-phenotype and genotype-clinical outcome to identify the treatment regimens most likely to be effective in persons with acquired or transmitted drug resistance. In order to accomplish these aims, we will expand the online publicly available Stanford HIV RT and Protease Sequence Database to represent, store, and analyze the diverse forms of data underlying drug resistance knowledge. Standardized protocols for exchanging data with the broad community of researchers studying HIV-1 drug resistance will be refined and validated. Improved methods for representing published drug resistance data, performing temporal queries and knowledge discovery, and for analyzing genotypic resistance data in a phylogenetic context will be implemented. This proposal is also the start of a three-way collaboration between Stanford University, the University College of London (UCL), and Oxford University. UCL is on the forefront of research into the problem of transmitted drug resistance and Oxford University is on the forefront of research on virus evolution and population genetics.           n/a",Public HIV Drug Resistance Database,7609109,R01AI068581,"['Acute', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Back', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug Design', 'Drug resistance', 'Evolution', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'HIV', 'HIV drug resistance', 'HIV therapy', 'HIV-1', 'HIV-1 drug resistance', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'London', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Population Dynamics', 'Population Genetics', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Recombinants', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Work', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'college', 'data exchange', 'fitness', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'non-drug', 'resistance mutation', 'response', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,621795,0.019234147240268933
"Technology to Identify and Assay Chemical Genomic Probes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of this proposal is to develop and deploy cutting edge technologies and chemical genomic tools and to understand the effects of small molecule inhibitors in vivo, and to characterize the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae on a systems level. Over the course of the past 3.5 years, as part of an NHGRI-funded project, we have applied three unique genome-wide screens to ~2,000 chemical inhibitors of growth. These data have led to several notable findings, including: 1) novel drug/target interactions, 2) a chemical phenotype for nearly all yeast genes, 3) a systems-level characterization of yeast, and 4) a better understanding of chemical structure-activity relationships as they manifest in vivo. These data have also guided the design of the next-generation chemical genomic assays proposed herein. Using our established bioinformatics and robotics infrastructure, we will design the next generation of assays to interrogate the genome's interaction with small molecules to unprecedented levels of scrutiny, while decreasing cost per chemical. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Small molecules, the central focus of this proposal, make up the majority of FDA approved drugs.

"Motivational Interviewing Training for Drug Abuse Treatment Counselors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Drug abuse is a significant, growing, and far-reaching problem, with up to 22.6 million Americans age 12 and older having experienced substance abuse or dependency problems in 2006, as reported in SAMHSA's 2006 National Survey on Drug Use and Health report. Without question, effective treatment is essential to curbing this crisis and improving public health across the nation. Motivational interviewing (MI), one of the most rigorously studied psychosocial substance abuse treatments, is now recognized as among the most effective evidence-based practices in the field and is endorsed by numerous federal and private sources. Research has shown it to be effective in not only reducing drug abuse, but also increasing patient engagement and retention, and creating and sustaining change in underserved populations. In response to NIDA's goal to ensure rapid, effective dissemination and use of research results to significantly improve treatment of drug abuse and addiction, Terra Nova Learning Systems plans to develop a course titled motivational interviewing training for drug abuse treatment counselors. Offered in both online and print formats, making it accessible to computer and non-computer users alike and providing a more affordable option than in-person trainings, the curriculum features empirically grounded content authored by accomplished MI experts. In addition, the course offers innovative decision tree skill-building exercises, real-life case studies, personal reflections from counselors who practice MI, reference materials for counselor use after the training, an online community for ongoing discussion, and assessments for continuing education certification. Suitable for drug abuse counselors of varying disciplines and education levels, the course provides a consistent, solid foundation in MI technique along with skill proficiency that can be readily implemented in the field. During Phase I, Terra Nova and a team of MI experts will research and outline the motivational interviewing course and produce a single Prototype Module plus samples of related materials to establish proof-of-concept for Phase II work. All Phase I deliverables will be rigorously evaluated by a group of expert consultants, further tested by two to three end-user focus groups, and refined to create the highest quality instructional design model for Phase II development.

"Mining Internet Conversation For Evidence Of Herbal Association    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mining Internet Conversations for Evidence of Herbal-Associated Adverse Events Abstract This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10), Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-102: Informatics for Post- Marketing Surveillance. Often, users of online resources such as discussion boards seek advice about topics they are hesitant to discuss with providers. One such topic is the use of herbal supplements. Relatively little is known about the use and effects of these supplements, primarily due to patient and provider reticence, but also owing to the lack of a formal reporting mechanism. As a result, adverse events and interactions possibly related to herbal use are difficult to evaluate in a population-based investigation. The potential impact for monitoring side effects and adverse events associated with herbal use as well as prescription drug interactions with herbals is highly important. The goal of this project is to develop, apply, and evaluate computational intelligence tools for mining conversational text for evidence of adverse events and side effects of herbals and prescription drugs reported by users of online communication resources relating to breast and prostate cancer. This project will use these informatics tools as the cornerstone of a new approach to post-marketing surveillance, and has been determined by the National Library of Medicine to be responsive to the stated Challenge Topic. This project will be conducted at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, which contributes substantially to the local economy. In 2008, the School created 37,000 jobs and $5.4 billion in regional economic activity. This project will create or retain eight jobs. The School's ability to fill these positions is evident: in 2008, Penn received more than 24,600 applications for just 840 open staff research positions. Mining Internet Conversations for Evidence of Herbal-Associated Adverse Events There has been increasing discussion about the use of herbals with the advent of online resources such as message boards, blogs, and chat rooms. In mining the text from such online, new information about side effects and adverse events associated with herbal use as well as prescription drug interactions with herbals will be discovered. This is highly important for the health of the public, as it stands to create the framework for an herbal sentinel network system.              Mining Internet Conversations for Evidence of Herbal-Associated Adverse Events There has been increasing discussion about the use of herbals with the advent of online resources such as message boards, blogs, and chat rooms.

"RESEARCHING THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF A LOCAL METHAMPHETAMINE MARKET    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project investigates a significant feature of the socioenvironmental context of illicit drug use. Directly or indirectly, all users engage the illicit drug economy. Understanding the market roles of producers, consumers, and distributors is critical for prevention, treatment and law enforcement. However, drug markets are dynamic; they continuously adapt to internal and external forces. No theory (or methodology) exists to describe such dynamics. This five-year study develops and systematically field-tests agent-based modeling (ABM) methods to represent consumer, dealer, and health behaviors associated with the methamphetamine market in Cuyahoga and Summit Counties, OH. This approach will provide researchers with an entirely new perspective for observing outcomes of interactive behaviors, as well as the opportunity to perform experiments not possible in the real world. To program simulations, we will characterize roles, motives, behaviors, and interactions of market participants utilizing ethnographic methods (specifically, decision-tree modeling techniques). To validate and extend these data, we will collect quantitative measures of participants' daily behaviors, drug consumption, costs, and interactions using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). We will implement these techniques through a three-wave panel study (N=204); data from the panel study will characterize the sample, inform simulation parameters, and help validate simulation output. Our simulations will subsequently incorporate both descriptive ethnographic data and quantitative longitudinal data so that the behaviors of ""agents"" (simulated people interacting within the virtual market) will accurately reflect the realities of the real-world drug market. The simulation-based computer laboratory produced by this project will offer policymakers and researchers a tool for: (1) dynamically representing illicit drug market operations, (2) experimenting with agent behaviors and market parameters and conditions, and (3) evaluating ""what if"" policy scenarios intended to influence outcomes. Applying Complexity theory by systematically combining the rich detail of ethnography with ABM's power to aggregate socially complex behaviors, this project will have great practical utility. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Conduct ethnographic research on the methamphetamine market in Cuyahoga and Summit Counties, OH. (2) Enrich these data using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), collecting self-report data on daily drug consumption, production, sales, decisions, strategies etc. (3) Inform simulation parameters using a panel survey of 204 active methamphetamine users. (4) Construct a computer lab of ABM simulations reproducing how the local methamphetamine market operates integrating both social (i.e., health) and economic behaviors. (5) Experiment with the ABM simulations to: understand how the market operates and functions; create and test policy-based intervention scenarios (e.g. enforcement, treatment, and outreach) intended to impact outcomes; and model risk behaviors (e.g., needle sharing, trading drugs for sex) influencing the spread of HIV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug users risk behaviors are influenced by the markets in which they acquire drugs. However, these markets are dynamic and reactive which make understanding and modeling this interaction challenging. The objective of this research is to field test a transportable, theoretically informed, and inter-disciplinary research methodology using agent-based simulation to evaluate market dynamics and their impact on methamphetamine distribution and HIV-related risk behaviors.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Drug users risk behaviors are influenced by the markets in which they acquire drugs.

A major barrier to effective drug selection is the lack of sufficient published information on the safety of drugs, particularly new drugs. A computerized system operating at healthcare facilities that could provide continuous, active surveillance and timely identification of potential safety issues following the introduction of a new drug to a formulary is highly desirable. Such a system could lead to safer drug use policy, more cost-effective formulary decisions, better healthcare, and earlier detection of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The implications of such technology for improving a national drug surveillance system will be apparent because ADRs can complicate the patient's medical condition, increase morbidity, and result in death (about 7,000 deaths per year in the U.S. were attributed to ADRs). At present, evidence on safety issues that would inform these decisions is generated primarily by the FDA's post-marketing surveillance system MedWatch(tm). MedWatch(tm) is a passive system that depends on voluntary, spontaneous reports. Because the system is limited by low reporting rates and the slow accumulation of sufficient events to enable a critical analysis, delays occur in the identification and withdrawal of problematic drugs from the market or labeling them with black box warnings. These delays have resulted in unnecessary mortality, morbidity, and costs of healthcare.   We propose to develop an innovative team-based agent system, named ADRMonitor, for actively monitoring and detecting signal pairs implicating anticipated or potential ADRs at a healthcare facility. Each ADRMonitor user (e.g., physicians and drug safety officers) will have his/her own software agent that is accessible via the Internet and plays two roles -- assisting the user in his/her decision-making, and collaborating with agents of other team members. A key feature of the proposed approach is that the agents will continuously and autonomously collaborate with one another. They anticipate information needs of their teammates and share information proactively so that the users can be alerted timely about signal pairs.    To demonstrate the feasibility, we plan to develop a prototype of ADRMonitor in this two-year pilot project, which will be undertaken collaboratively by our multidisciplinary team. Our preliminary design and analysis show the proposed methodology to be promising. The proposed effort represents a critical first step toward a subsequent development of a more comprehensive ADRMonitor in later phases of this research endeavor that would use the signal pairs to detect ADRs and expand the resultant system to cover healthcare in a region or across the country. The proposed methodology is general in nature and can be adapted for other important applications such as bioterrorism surveillance.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A computerized system operating at healthcare facilities that could provide continuous, active surveillance and timely identification of potential safety issues following the introduction of a new drug to a formulary is highly desirable.

"Elucidation of Leukocyte and Macrophage Biomarker Signatures from Drugs of Abuse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elucidation of Leukocyte and Macrophage Biomarker Signatures from Drugs of Abuse Project Summary/Abstract. Drugs of abuse are metabolized by the cells of the body including macrophages and leukocytes. Macrophages are primarily responsible for the detection, phagocytosis and digestion of toxins in the bloodstream and peripheral tissues. Normal cellular metabolism of macrophages and other cells are permanently affected by the presence of toxins in the blood which may include illicit substances such as cocaine and alcohol. We propose to study macrophages and other blood cells from normal and cocaine addicted rats and mice in automated, high-throughput biomicroelectromechanical systems (BioMEMS) coupled to ion mobility mass spectrometers and obtain comprehensive measurements of metabolic precursors, products and signaling molecules in real time. We will analyze the wide-spectrum of temporally varying biochemical signature of the living cells before and during exposure to precise doses of cocaine and alcohol administered to cells in the traps using automatic inference of mathematical models. We hypothesize that the resulting metabolic models and biochemical signatures from the cells of addicted animals and normal animals will differ significantly due to permanent alterations in cell physiology brought about by prior exposure. Passive observations and those made during simple interventions can tell much about the response of the cells to a drug or toxin, but the specification of many of the interlocking and nonlinear control systems of individual cells is hidden by the very nature of closed-loop control and requires experiments that measure very large numbers of variables. The automated inference presents daunting challenges that cannot be addressed by a single discipline and hence signifies an exciting frontier for interdisciplinary research. A group of biomedical, chemical and computer engineers, chem- ists, molecular biologists and physicists at Vanderbilt, Cornell, Duke and CFD Research Corporation, propose to merge their talents and optimize computer-controlled nanoliter bioreactors that would use optical, electrical, and electrochemical sensors, two-dimensional mass spectrometry, and novel computer algorithms to design and conduct experiments on small populations of living cells. The goal of this work is to automatically infer the underlying nonlinear dynamical equations governing the behavior of the cells and their environment in the presence and absence of cocaine and alcohol. We will address this challenge by applying Cornell's Symbolic Regression and Exploration-Estimation Algorithms that use in silico coevolution of both the model and tests of the model to experimentally determine which conditions are best suited for further evolution. Our suite of micro- fabricated BioMEMS nanobioreactors, dynamic sensors, and cellular control technologies ensures that we will have adequate dynamical data to create sophisticated metabolic and signaling models of macrophages and leukocytes. This research will have a unique and remarkable educational, intellectual, medical and societal value. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work will impact public health by more accurately characterizing drug abuse and the history of drug abuse in individuals so as to tailor methods of intervention and treatment strategies on a case-by-case basis, thereby increasing the effectiveness of assisting addicted individuals in relinquishing drug-seeking behavior. This approach aims to decrease long-term medical costs associated with prolonged drug and alcohol abuse using a novel approach in the identification of off target leukocyte and macrophage biomarker signatures for rapid and reliable diagnostics of drug use/abuse history. The technology developed will be utilized to gain further understanding of the underlying biological pathways that control addictive behav- ior, which is the first step to addressing destructive behavior on the personal level.           Project Narrative.

"Reducing Drug Name Confusion With Better Search Software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Confusions between drug names that look and sound alike (e.g., Keppra(r) and Kaletra(r), Indocid(r) and Endocet(r)) continue to occur frequently, and each confusion poses a threat to patient safety.2-5 Our long term objective is to design, build, test and continuously improve tools that minimize the harm caused by drug name confusion errors. For a patient to be harmed, an error must occur and it must go undetected until it reaches the patient. Harm is minimized either by preventing the error from occurring in the first place or by rapidly detecting the error so its adverse effects can be mitigated. Both prevention and mitigation efforts have been hindered by the lack of valid, reliable and efficient methods for assessing name confusion error rates. The gold standard for measuring medication error rates is direct observation of the prescribing-dispensing- administering process. This method is valid and reliable but is too time consuming and expensive to be widely used. As a result, many error reduction interventions have been designed, but few have been tested, and their effectiveness is, for the most part, unknown. Similarly, efforts to mitigate the effects of wrong drug errors are virtually non-existent because there has been no accurate and efficient way to detect such errors after they occur. The key to improving both prevention and mitigation of harm is the development of scalable, efficient, valid and reliable methods for detecting these drug name confusion errors. Our short-term goal is to develop and validate an algorithm for detecting drug name confusion errors by analyzing suspicious patterns in real-world prescription drug databases (in our case, integrated electronic medical records from the US Veterans Health Administration). We plan to test the following three hypotheses: 1. Computerized measures of drug name confusability can be used to identify wrong-drug errors in real-world prescription drug databases. 2. The number of errors detected will increase as the predicted probability of confusion increases. 3. The classification performance of the error detection algorithm (i.e., its accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) can be enhanced by applying machine learning techniques and by incorporating additional information from the electronic medical record (e.g., time between refills, diagnosis, lab values, demographics, etc.) To test these hypotheses, we propose studies with the following specific aims: 1. To design and implement an algorithm for the detection of suspicious patterns in prescription drug databases. 2. To test and validate this algorithm using real-world prescription data from the US Veterans Health Administration. 3. To use machine learning techniques to optimize and further validate the performance of the error detection algorithm, incorporating additional information from the electronic medical record. Health care professionals often confuse drug names that look and sound alike. Wrong drug errors occur in hospitals and in community pharmacies and can cause serious harm to patients. Our project seeks to improve patient safety by developing and testing new techniques for detecting wrong drug errors in integrated electronic medical records.             n/a",Reducing Drug Name Confusion With Better Search Software,7501496,R44RR021232,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Classification', 'Community Pharmacy', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Hospitals', 'Indocid', 'Intervention', 'Keppra', 'Lopinavir/Ritonavir', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medication Errors', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Rate', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Veterans', 'computerized', 'demographics', 'design', 'health administration', 'improved', 'patient safety', 'prescription document', 'prescription procedure', 'prevent', 'sound', 'tool']",NCRR,PHARM I.R.,R44,2008,384760,0.03024871423256777
"Predicting Reactions of Xenobiotic Compounds in Mammals    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In pursuit of novel therapeutics, drug developers are scanning more compounds and covering more chemical space than ever before. The time required to bring a new drug into the market has not decreased, though the cost for drug discovery is steadily increasing. The root causes of this problem are related to efficacy, toxicity, and inappropriate absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, as shown by recent rigorous analyses. To focus on the ADMET(Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination and Toxicity) issues, pharmaceutical research groups have, since the late 1990s, moved various physicochemical property screens earlier in the drug discovery process. The metabolic transformations of pharmaceuticals profoundly impact their bioavailability, efficacy, chronic toxicity, metabolic idiosyncrasies, excretion rates and routes. Metabolism is one of the major hurdles to overcome. In silico tools enable fast and virtual screening of large numbers of compounds before compounds are synthesized. Such tools enable researchers to recognize complicated metabolic processes, to eliminate poor candidates, and then to use the knowledge gained to discern possible deficiencies in compounds. Still poorly understood, metabolism is the most difficult to predict. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a system to predict xenobiotic metabolism in mammals, and to gain insights into metabolism mechanisms (aim 1), and to study the differences in metabolism between humans and model animals (aim 2). We will use MDL's Metabolite database as a source of information about drug metabolism reactions. For aim 1, we will develop both global metabolism prediction systems, which can be applied to diverse substrate without prior knowledge of enzymes, and local models for particular enzymes, when prior knowledge of the enzymes involved in reactions is available. Global metabolism prediction systems will comprise many individual models, each of which will focus on an animal species (e.g., humans), an enzyme (e.g., CYP3A4) and a specific biotransformation (e.g., hydroxylation). Machine learning techniques will be used to build each individual model using various features to characterize the chemical environments of functional groups within molecules. For local models for an enzyme, we assume that the tight binding of ligands and enzymes is not required, but rather that reactions occur at sites where enzymes can easily attack. We will design ways to model the probability that a particular site will be attacked by enzymes. In Aim 1, both the global metabolism prediction system and the local models are trained on human reactions, so the models are animal specific. In Aim 2, we will build models for rat, which is a model animal in drug development. Using rat reactions listed in MDL's Metabolite database, we will establish a global metabolism system for rats and local models for rats using the same methods outlined in Aim 1. Though the methods are the same, the training sets are different, and it is expected that the models will make different predictions. By using drugs that are known to be metabolized differently in humans and rats, we will study differences in the human and rat models. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In pursuit of novel therapeutics, drug developers are scanning more compounds and covering more chemical space than ever before. ADMET(Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination and Toxicity) has assumed center stage in the drug discovery process. Predicting metabolism is one of the major challenges to be met, and metabolism is the most poorly understood of the ADMET processes, and the most difficult to predict.

"Preclinical predictive markers of post-approval drug safety    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The approval and subsequent withdrawal of widely prescribed unsafe drugs affects millions of lives annually. We have recently reported that a Bayesian network model can utilize preclinical, phase I and phase II data to predict phase III safety and efficacy with 78% accuracy. Our approach exceeds pharmaceutical industry performance. Our novel preliminary data demonstrate that identifying post-marketing safety issues independent of drug class is feasible using preclinical data only. Every drug has a unique set of preclinical dose versus primary effect curves and dose versus side effect curves. Our preliminary studies show that quantifiable features of preclinical dose versus primary effect curves predict post-approval safety withdrawal with impressive accuracy. Our objective is to build and distribute preclinical pharmacologic predictive models of post-approval clinical safety. Our specific aims are (1) to identify preclinical dose-effect indicators of post- approval drug safety and (2) to build and distribute preclinical indicator machine-learning models that predict post-approval drug safety. This proposal will deliver an open source drug safety sentinel that is based solely on preclinical data. The potential benefits to society include reduced exposure to unsafe drugs, an indicator for potentially suppressed safety data, and reduced burden on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System and other phase IV surveillance systems.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The approval and subsequent withdrawal of widely prescribed unsafe drugs affects millions of lives annually. Patients affected by toxicity suffer from drug-induced morbidity and mortality, while those patients who benefited from the drug without toxicity can no longer receive it.

"Internet Monitoring Of Prescription Drug Abuse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II application continues development of the Pharmaceutical Risk Internet Surveillance Monitor (PRISM), an innovative approach to postmarketing surveillance of indicators suggesting diversion/abuse of opioid pharmaceutical agents. Public health relevance of PRISM includes providing reliable and timely data to allow health, law enforcement, industry, and community leaders take steps to limit potential damage associated with an outbreak of pharmaceutical drug abuse. PRISM will be the first, systematically developed and hybrid or partially automated Internet monitoring service to track, at a product-specific level, the chatter of recreational users of pharmaceutical analgesics as they discuss their use/abuse of such drugs. Those who abuse prescription opioids have open access to Web sites, providing an unvarnished picture of users' communications about these drugs, including ideas and beliefs about the drugs as well as discussions of trends and preferences. Thus, Internet monitoring of drug-related messages may be useful for anticipating an increased risk of an abuse outbreak. The potential of these Internet data has not been exploited in a systematic manner to inform drug policy and planning. In Phase I, collaboration with software developers of MIT's General Inquirer (GI) explored the contributions of automated natural language processing methods to the unstructured, fragmented, but revealing messages posted by the online community of substance abusers. Reliable codes were achieved by human coders, supporting the feasibility of classifying content of Internet posts into meaningful categories of endorsing and discouraging abuse of different products. Completely automating such coding may be as yet out of reach. Furthermore, such codes may not have been the most meaningful qualitative information to draw from the posts. However, the overall level of chatter, based on counts of mentions of specific products, did appear to relate to measures of the attractiveness for abuse of target products. There are significant benefits of archiving such posts, using computer processing of raw posts to prep them for human coders, and searching among thousands of archived posts for selected topics of interest (e.g., sources, extraction methods, adverse events, etc.). In Phase II, we will (1) develop software to find, harvest, and archive posts from eligible Web sites for subsequent analyses, (2) refine the nature and types of qualitative questions, (3) develop and test methods of using automated processing of raw posts to improve the reliability and efficiency of human coding, (4) continue exploration of methods to enhance automation of message coding, (5) refine automated data mining of posts discussions on specific topics including (extraction, sources of drug, extreme reactions, etc.) to target drugs, and (6) test external validity of data collected by PRISM. Given the extraordinary financial implications for pharmaceutical companies needing to demonstrate to the FDA that they have an adequate Risk Minimization Action Plan prior to approval for new, potentially addictive medications, a tool like PRISM holds remarkable commercial appeal.                      Public Health Relevance: A system like PRISM to monitor the chatter about abusable substances on Internet is widely recognized as having extraordinary public health importance by the FDA, DEA, and pharmaceutical companies. Ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of abuse trends detected from these Internet sources will be essential to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health programs, closely integrated with timely dissemination of these data to those responsible for prevention and control.             n/a",Internet Monitoring Of Prescription Drug Abuse,7394900,R44DA020279,"['Accounting', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Analgesics', 'Archives', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Belief', 'Categories', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Count', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Evaluation', 'Government', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Oxycodone', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population Surveillance', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Rate', 'Reaction', 'Recreational Drugs', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Site', 'Source', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Waxes', 'authority', 'base', 'data mining', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'opioid abuse', 'preference', 'prescription document', 'prescription drug abuse', 'prescription procedure', 'programs', 'response', 'software development', 'substance abuser', 'tool', 'trend']",NIDA,"INFLEXXION, INC.",R44,2008,374269,0.046303603784933506
"Public HIV Drug Resistance Database    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV drug resistance data are critical for HIV drug resistance surveillance, antiretroviral drug design, and the management of persons infected with drug-resistant HIV. Three fundamental types of correlations form the basis of drug resistance knowledge: (1) Correlations between genotypic data with the treatments of persons from whom sequenced HIV-1 isolates have been obtained (genotype-treatment); (2) Correlations between genotype and in vitro drug susceptibility (genotype-phenotype); and (3) Correlations between genotype and the clinical response to a new treatment regimen (genotype-outcome). Accordingly our three plans are as follows: (1) To use phylogenetically-based statistical analysis of correlations between mutations in the targets of HIV therapy (genotype) and antiretroviral treatment to distinguish between drug- and non-drug- related HIV-1 evolution, to identify temporal and geographic patterns in the prevalence of drug resistance, and to identify the spread of viruses with particular patterns of drug-resistance mutations. (2) To use patterns of mutations in the targets of antiretroviral therapy, antiretroviral treatment data, and in vitro drug susceptibility results to help prioritize the clinical development of experimental antiretroviral compounds. (3) To us correlations between genotype-phenotype and genotype-clinical outcome to identify the treatment regimens most likely to be effective in persons with acquired or transmitted drug resistance. In order to accomplish these aims, we will expand the online publicly available Stanford HIV RT and Protease Sequence Database to represent, store, and analyze the diverse forms of data underlying drug resistance knowledge. Standardized protocols for exchanging data with the broad community of researchers studying HIV-1 drug resistance will be refined and validated.

"Gene Expression in Drug-inflammation Models as Predictive of Idiosyncratic ADRS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Idiosyncratic, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have serious health and economic consequences, yet they are not identified in preclinical testing due to a lack of predictive models. We have developed an animal model that reproduces idiosyncratic liver injury. The model involves treatment of rats with a nontoxic dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce mild inflammation followed by treatment with a nontoxic dose of drug. Using this model with two drugs in different pharmacological classes, hepatic gene expression near the onset of injury distinguishes drugs associated with idiosyncratic liver injury in humans from drugs with similar structures that do not have this liability. The long term goal of this research is to evaluate the usefulness of changes in hepatic gene expression in animal models of drug-inflammation interaction as a preclinical predictor of the propensity of drugs to cause idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity in humans. To test the hypothesis that global, hepatic gene expression changes in animal models of inflammation-drug interactions can be used to predict the propensity of drugs to cause human, idiosyncratic liver injury, rats will be cotreated with LPS and one of several drugs (at doses that alone are not hepatotoxic), and microarray analysis of gene expression will be performed on livers. In Specific Aim 1, hepatic gene expression will be analyzed for treatment-related changes. Drugs known to produce idiosyncratic liver injury in people and drugs that are in the same pharmacological classes but are not associated with idiosyncrasy will serve as a ""training set"" in this Aim. In Aim 2, the microarray data will be analyzed for patterns of expression unique to the drug-inflammation interactions that are associated with idiosyncrasy-producing drugs, and the expression data will be probed for specific genes or sets of genes that determine these unique patterns. In Aim 3, additional drugs will be used as a ""validation set"" to evaluate the usefulness of the patterns and genes identified in Aims 1 and 2. The immediate product of these studies will be an animal model of drug-inflammation interaction for which a set of genes has been identified that predicts the propensity for a drug to cause idiosyncratic liver injury in people. If successful, these studies will provide models with which to identify preclinically those drugs that could cause this type of liver damage in people. The relevance of this research to public health lies in the potential to prevent the occurrence of ""unpredictable"", drug-induced liver damage. n/a",Gene Expression in Drug-inflammation Models as Predictive of Idiosyncratic ADRS,7487344,R21GM075865,"['Address', 'Adverse reactions', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorpromazine', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug toxicity', 'Drug usage', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Models', 'Exposure to', 'Famotidine', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Microarray Analysis', 'Genes', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histamine-2 Receptor Antagonist', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Ranitidine', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Screening procedure', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Withdrawal', 'animal data', 'base', 'data mining', 'drug development', 'drug market', 'health economics', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'post-market', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'segregation', 'trovafloxacin']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,351137,0.030014498553063138
"Distributed, Collaborative Intelligent Agents for Proactive Post-Marketing Drug S    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Healthcare systems and insurers nationwide regularly make decisions regarding which drugs to include or exclude from their formularies based on evidence concerning benefits, risks, and costs of the medications. A major barrier to effective drug selection is the lack of sufficient published information on the safety of drugs, particularly new drugs. A computerized system operating at healthcare facilities that could provide continuous, active surveillance and timely identification of potential safety issues following the introduction of a new drug to a formulary is highly desirable. Such a system could lead to safer drug use policy, more cost-effective formulary decisions, better healthcare, and earlier detection of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The implications of such technology for improving a national drug surveillance system will be apparent because ADRs can complicate the patient's medical condition, increase morbidity, and result in death (about 7,000 deaths per year in the U.S. were attributed to ADRs). At present, evidence on safety issues that would inform these decisions is generated primarily by the FDA's post-marketing surveillance system MedWatch(tm). MedWatch(tm) is a passive system that depends on voluntary, spontaneous reports. Because the system is limited by low reporting rates and the slow accumulation of sufficient events to enable a critical analysis, delays occur in the identification and withdrawal of problematic drugs from the market or labeling them with black box warnings. These delays have resulted in unnecessary mortality, morbidity, and costs of healthcare.   We propose to develop an innovative team-based agent system, named ADRMonitor, for actively monitoring and detecting signal pairs implicating anticipated or potential ADRs at a healthcare facility. Each ADRMonitor user (e.g., physicians and drug safety officers) will have his/her own software agent that is accessible via the Internet and plays two roles -- assisting the user in his/her decision-making, and collaborating with agents of other team members. A key feature of the proposed approach is that the agents will continuously and autonomously collaborate with one another. They anticipate information needs of their teammates and share information proactively so that the users can be alerted timely about signal pairs.    To demonstrate the feasibility, we plan to develop a prototype of ADRMonitor in this two-year pilot project, which will be undertaken collaboratively by our multidisciplinary team. Our preliminary design and analysis show the proposed methodology to be promising. The proposed effort represents a critical first step toward a subsequent development of a more comprehensive ADRMonitor in later phases of this research endeavor that would use the signal pairs to detect ADRs and expand the resultant system to cover healthcare in a region or across the country. The proposed methodology is general in nature and can be adapted for other important applications such as bioterrorism surveillance.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A computerized system operating at healthcare facilities that could provide continuous, active surveillance and timely identification of potential safety issues following the introduction of a new drug to a formulary is highly desirable.

"Higher Throughput Behavioral Screening of Cognitive Enhancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted in response to NIMH research topic J1, neuroscience and basic behavioral science in the SBIR solicitation and PA-04-086, development of high throughput tools for brain and behavior. We aim to alleviate the bottleneck in drug discovery for cognitive dysfunction with CognoCube(tm), an automated high-throughput system of behavioral analysis of cognitive function. CognoCube(tm) will comprise innovative automated testing, computer vision, and machine-learning algorithms to capture and integrate behavioral effects of drugs affecting cognitive function. CognoCube will capture many cognitive domains of high degree of homology between humans and rodents that are relevant in CNS disorders such as schizophrenia, dementia, attention-deficit disorder and ageing. This system will provide rapid and accurate indices of the therapeutic potential of novel cognitive enhancers. Phase I will be focused on proof of concept, namely, capture of behaviors relevant to targeted cognitive domains, sensitivity to pharmacological manipulation and robust bioinformatic analysis. The CognoCube(tm) system will expand its capacity during Phase II of the project to be able to assess a library of 1000 compounds per year. With libraries chosen to provide a high likelihood of CNS activity we expect to be able to detect up to a dozen new compounds per year with CNS activity in the area of cognition. Those compounds will be further assessed with standard tests of cognition and their mechanism of action will be studied through pharmacological means and binding profiling. Commercial value: The population that could benefit from new and improved cognitive enhancers is estimated at more than 30 million in the United States alone. Major challenges for drug discovery in this area include the lack of reliable and efficient in vivo testing systems. Although standardized objective test batteries have been developed for evaluation of human cognition, there is no such standard battery for rodents.

"Reducing Drug Name Confusion With Better Search Software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Confusions between drug names that look and sound alike (e.g., Keppra(r) and Kaletra(r), Indocid(r) and Endocet(r)) continue to occur frequently, and each confusion poses a threat to patient safety.2-5 Our long term objective is to design, build, test and continuously improve tools that minimize the harm caused by drug name confusion errors. For a patient to be harmed, an error must occur and it must go undetected until it reaches the patient. Harm is minimized either by preventing the error from occurring in the first place or by rapidly detecting the error so its adverse effects can be mitigated. Both prevention and mitigation efforts have been hindered by the lack of valid, reliable and efficient methods for assessing name confusion error rates. The gold standard for measuring medication error rates is direct observation of the prescribing-dispensing- administering process. This method is valid and reliable but is too time consuming and expensive to be widely used. As a result, many error reduction interventions have been designed, but few have been tested, and their effectiveness is, for the most part, unknown. Similarly, efforts to mitigate the effects of wrong drug errors are virtually non-existent because there has been no accurate and efficient way to detect such errors after they occur. The key to improving both prevention and mitigation of harm is the development of scalable, efficient, valid and reliable methods for detecting these drug name confusion errors. Our short-term goal is to develop and validate an algorithm for detecting drug name confusion errors by analyzing suspicious patterns in real-world prescription drug databases (in our case, integrated electronic medical records from the US Veterans Health Administration). We plan to test the following three hypotheses: 1. Computerized measures of drug name confusability can be used to identify wrong-drug errors in real-world prescription drug databases. 2. The number of errors detected will increase as the predicted probability of confusion increases. 3. The classification performance of the error detection algorithm (i.e., its accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) can be enhanced by applying machine learning techniques and by incorporating additional information from the electronic medical record (e.g., time between refills, diagnosis, lab values, demographics, etc.) To test these hypotheses, we propose studies with the following specific aims: 1. To design and implement an algorithm for the detection of suspicious patterns in prescription drug databases. 2. To test and validate this algorithm using real-world prescription data from the US Veterans Health Administration. 3. To use machine learning techniques to optimize and further validate the performance of the error detection algorithm, incorporating additional information from the electronic medical record. Health care professionals often confuse drug names that look and sound alike. Wrong drug errors occur in hospitals and in community pharmacies and can cause serious harm to patients. Our project seeks to improve patient safety by developing and testing new techniques for detecting wrong drug errors in integrated electronic medical records.             n/a",Reducing Drug Name Confusion With Better Search Software,7273372,R44RR021232,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Classification', 'Community Pharmacy', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Hospitals', 'Indocid', 'Intervention', 'Keppra', 'Lopinavir/Ritonavir', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medication Errors', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Rate', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Veterans', 'computerized', 'demographics', 'design', 'health administration', 'improved', 'patient safety', 'prescription document', 'prescription procedure', 'prevent', 'sound', 'tool']",NCRR,PHARM I.R.,R44,2007,388793,0.03024871423256777
"Public HIV Drug Resistance Database    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV drug resistance data are critical for HIV drug resistance surveillance, antiretroviral drug design, and the management of persons infected with drug-resistant HIV. Three fundamental types of correlations form the basis of drug resistance knowledge: (1) Correlations between genotypic data with the treatments of persons from whom sequenced HIV-1 isolates have been obtained (genotype-treatment); (2) Correlations between genotype and in vitro drug susceptibility (genotype-phenotype); and (3) Correlations between genotype and the clinical response to a new treatment regimen (genotype-outcome). Accordingly our three plans are as follows: (1) To use phylogenetically-based statistical analysis of correlations between mutations in the targets of HIV therapy (genotype) and antiretroviral treatment to distinguish between drug- and non-drug- related HIV-1 evolution, to identify temporal and geographic patterns in the prevalence of drug resistance, and to identify the spread of viruses with particular patterns of drug-resistance mutations. (2) To use patterns of mutations in the targets of antiretroviral therapy, antiretroviral treatment data, and in vitro drug susceptibility results to help prioritize the clinical development of experimental antiretroviral compounds. (3) To us correlations between genotype-phenotype and genotype-clinical outcome to identify the treatment regimens most likely to be effective in persons with acquired or transmitted drug resistance. In order to accomplish these aims, we will expand the online publicly available Stanford HIV RT and Protease Sequence Database to represent, store, and analyze the diverse forms of data underlying drug resistance knowledge. Standardized protocols for exchanging data with the broad community of researchers studying HIV-1 drug resistance will be refined and validated. Improved methods for representing published drug resistance data, performing temporal queries and knowledge discovery, and for analyzing genotypic resistance data in a phylogenetic context will be implemented.

"In Silico Assesment of Drug Metabolism and Toxicity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Failure of molecules in the late stages of drug development are to a large extent attributable to poor ADME/Tox properties. These properties are generally predictable in the earlier, cheaper stages of drug discovery. The goal of this work is to predict metabolism and toxicity using a computational suite called MetaDrug. This integrates human endogenous and xenobiotic metabolic as well as signalling pathways and can also incorporate gene expression, and experimental data. Under phase I, novel algorithms for predicting major CYP-mediated pathways were generated and successfully validated along with rules for predicting metabolites and reactive metabolites formed which are likely to be toxic. This algorithm development enabled the prediction of substrates and metabolites, the affinity and the rate of metabolism as well as interactions with other endogenous, metabolic and signalling pathways. With phase II funding we will develop large comprehensive datasets (>1000 molecules) for in vitro drug-drug interactions with the major CYPs, and use these for generating machine learning algorithms for these human drug metabolizing enzymes. We will also annotate rat and mouse data for drug metabolism and the transcriptional regulation of these enzymes, capturing the kinetic data which can also be used for predictive model building. We will also generate a novel algorithm for the accurate prediction of metabolites using the metabolite rules from phase I to produce a molecular fingerprint for known drugs. The database of molecules with known human metabolites will then be used as an input for a machine learning algorithm. We will combine the predictions from our various QSAR models for enzyme affinity and rate of metabolism, the relative contributions of these enzymes and their tissue distribution, to ultimately predict the clearance of a drug. The proposed work will enable GeneGo to develop a unique tool that will improve the prediction of metabolism and toxicity.

"Detection of drug effect in small groups using PET DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The purpose of this proposal is to develop a tool, based on positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and advanced image-analysis methods, to address a critical need faced by the pharmaceutical industry.  Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals that target the brain can be difficult and subjective; therefore, pharmaceutical companies often spend millions of dollars in clinical development of a compound that is ultimately dropped due to problems encountered in human testing. Thus, methods are needed which can help make a simple go/no-go decision about a candidate drug, so as to eliminate ineffective drugs early in their evaluation process.      PET imaging with FDG promises to be an effective solution to this problem. Based on PET, we propose to develop a new product that will directly answer the basic go/no-go question of whether a drug merits further study. Specifically, we will investigate in Phase I whether it is possible to determine, using only around five to eight subjects, whether a candidate drug has any measurable metabolic effect on the brain. If an effect is found, then additional subjects can be scanned to obtain the full complement needed for more detailed characterization of the drug. If no effect is found, then the drug can be eliminated from further consideration, and resources can be applied to the next candidate.      The technical challenge will be to determine whether optimized machine-learning techniques can permit this initial go/no-go decision to be made with a small number of PET scans. We will use prediction accuracy as a measure of the strength of drug effect, and determine whether this metric can be computed reliably in small groups of subjects. In recent academic work, we have demonstrated that prediction accuracy can be tremendously enhanced by using multivariate machine-learning methods. Our goal will be to bring these new approaches to bear, so as to obtain the greatest amount of information possible from the data at the least cost.      The specific aims will be to: 1) Implement a hierarchy of learning algorithms ranked in terms of model complexity, from low to high, as follows: generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) with white noise assumption, canonical variates analysis (CVA), quadratic discriminate analysis (QDA), and relevance vector machines (RVM); 2) Use analytical statistical models, and the NPAIRS resampling framework, to estimate prediction accuracy for each method, which will be used as a measure of the strength of drug effect; and 3) Compute performance versus number of subjects N, spatial smoothing, and number of principal components used. The performance of optimized algorithmic configurations will reveal the feasibility of the proposed concept. n/a",Detection of drug effect in small groups using PET,6885469,R43MH073204,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'brain metabolism', 'clinical research', 'drug metabolism', 'drug screening /evaluation', 'human data', 'mathematical model', 'pharmacokinetics', 'positron emission tomography', 'statistics /biometry', 'technology /technique development']",NIMH,"PREDICTEK, LLC.",R43,2005,100000,0.06818930847333285
"HIGH THROUGHPUT IN VIVO DRUG DISCOVERY-PHASE 1    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The current trend in drug discovery is to develop drugs with a high level of selectivity for a single receptor. Although this is a real improvement for certain therapeutic areas, this may present a real issue for the development of novel treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Indeed, neuropsychiatric disorders are complex, multigenic disorders that involve multiple neuronal circuits. Therefore, it is not surprising that many of the most efficacious drugs in psychiatry, such as clozapine, are considered ""dirty drugs"" (i.e. have multiple targets), that were discovered by screening in vivo, i.e. looking at their behavioral impact using various animal models, rather than making predictions of their function based on their receptor profile. Although attractive, this approach was neither efficient nor scalable until now. PsychoGenics is developing a proprietary, high throughput, in vivo platform known as Smart Cube TM, which is being used to screen and select drug candidates with potential to treat major psychiatric disorders including depression, psychosis, and anxiety disorders. This approach examines the behavioral response of a mouse to various challenges under normal and perturbed (e.g. drug treated) conditions. Using computer vision algorithms, behavior is captured and bioinformatic tools are applied to reveal the temporal behavioral profile or ""signature"" in response to treatment.  PsychoGenics is building a database of signatures for known and approved compounds, which it can use to compare to the profiles of NCEs. PsychoGenics aims to demonstrate that this behavior-driven approach to drug discovery can yield clinical candidates selected from high quality libraries designed with compounds that have drug-like chemical and structural properties. The goal is to screen 120 compounds in Abstract compounds in Smart CubeTM in Phase I to find ""hits"" which, with the aid of novel computational chemistry algorithms, undergo behavior-driven (i.e. Smart Cube TM) lead optimization in Phase II.

"MCASE QSAR Expert System for Salmonella Mutagenicity   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational expert systems provide an         inexpensive and fast alternative to short term genotoxicity assays such as the       Ames test. Validation studies show the predictive capability of the MCASE            system is about 85 percent.

"Pharmacogenetic Prediction of Paroxetine Response  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project proposes the development of a computational model, called GeneRx, to incorporate pharmacogenetics and nonlinear adaptive algorithms toward optimizing anti-schizophrenic therapy on a patient specific basis.   Preliminary studies on the anti-schizophrenic drug olanzapine show a 40% patient-by-patient error between predicted starting dose and optimal therapeutic dose, using a prototype trained only with patient chart information. This is a significant reduction from the range of starting doses for olanzapine currently used, which is from 1 to 80 mgs/day. Anti-schizophrenic drugs likewise have a large window of therapeutic options, including significant variation in dosages, medications, and combinations of therapies used. Using patient-specific genetic information in conjunction with patient medical chart information, obtained from schizophrenia studies performed by outside sources, we propose to develop computational models to predict efficacy of treatment (i.e. Response/Non-response) to the neuroleptic risperidone. Genetic data for each patient will be acquired by genotyping DNA from the blood samples, scored as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present or absent in key schizophrenia-related genes. GeneRx will take a patient's individual genetic, demographic, and environmental variables and predict if the patient will respond initial risperidone drug therapy. Response will be measured by change in standard severity test scores. A more efficient method to prescribe effective anti-schizophrenic pharmaceuticals would expedite recovery, minimize side effects, and reduce medical costs.   n/a",Pharmacogenetic Prediction of Paroxetine Response,6550614,R43MH066671,"['antipsychotic agents', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavioral genetics', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' depression', ' genetic polymorphism', ' genotype', ' human genetic material tag', ' human subject', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' paroxetine', ' pharmacogenetics', ' serotonin inhibitor']",NIMH,"PREDICTION SCIENCES, LLC",R43,2002,100000,0.017054809893812823

"Colon Cancer Networks: Linking Modeling to Experiment  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Development of computational models of signal transduction pathways implicated in colon cancer is proposed. These models give insight into the pathway's dynamical behavior and elucidate their roles in activating known oncogenic target genes. The project will model the Ras Map Kinase signal transduction pathway, which plays a central role in the development of colon cancer. The methods utilized, which will be further developed, combine computational modeling with experiments so that unknown parameters in the model are constrained. The goal is to create accurate, predictive models by combining the forward modeling approach with experimental data. The computational and experimental processes developed can be applied to other pathways implicated in colon cancer.   Accurate computational models of signaling pathways will bring rational, predictive science to the drug discovery process and lead to effective therapies for colon cancer. These simulations will help pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies prioritize drug targets, test the effects of lead compounds, and focus and direct laboratory efforts.   Specific aims are (1) to develop a detailed mathematical and computational model of the Ras Map Kinase pathway; (2) to conduct experiments on pathway components to extract the data needed to constrain parameters in the model; (3) to use and devise optimization algorithms to constrain parameters in the model and (4) generate predictions from the model.

"DRUG MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE FOR NCI CLINICAL TRIALS DDOTS was awarded a Phase I SBIR contract to create an algorithmic computer model which inventories and tracks all investigational drugs used in NCI-sponsored clinical trials. DDOTS met all of the requirements of the project with the development of a stand-alone system for pharmacy use entitled ""Investigational Drug Environmental Accountability"" (IDEA). At the request of the NCI's CTEP informatics workgroup, the project was extended for a period of six months in order to allow DDOTS to create and align the IDEA drug accountability file submission format for inclusion in the Drug Authorization and Review Tracking System (DARTS) being developed for NCI's Pharmacy Management Branch. Having successfully accomplished the above, the primary specific aim of this Phase II proposal is the actual production of the IDEA software system. The IDEA software program will be installed and operationalized at two beta test sites: the Ann Arbor Regional CCOP in Ann Arbor, Ml and the Carle Cancer Center in Urbana, IL. There is no investigational drug management and auditing software program presently available in either the commercial market or from health care organizations. The IDEA software provides a state-of-the-art technologic tool which serves to meet both the needs of cancer research sites and the NCI for improved efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness in the overall investigational drug management and inventory process. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Although the IDEA software is being developed for NCI-sponsored research programs, broad applicability exists for its use by all organizations conducting drug research, i.e., comprehensive cancer programs, university hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies.  n/a",DRUG MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE FOR NCI CLINICAL TRIALS,6071505,R44CA078105,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical trials', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' drug screening /evaluation', ' informatics']",NCI,"DDOTS, INC.",R44,2000,375000,0.06561213385311193
"BOND: Benchmarking based on heterogeneous biOmedical Network and Deep learning novel drug-target associations Project Summary/Abstract The applicant’s goals are to develop the necessary skills to become an independent translational biomedical informatics researcher in the area of computational drug repurposing. Exploring novel drug-target interactions (DTI) plays a crucial role in drug development. In order to lower the overall costs and uncover more potential screening targets, computational (in silico) methods have become popular and are commonly applied to poly-pharmacology and drug repurposing. Although machine learning-based strategies have been studied for years, there is no standardized benchmark that provides large-scale training datasets as well as diverse evaluation tasks to test different methods. Furthermore, the existing methods suffer from remarkable limitations, where 1) results are often biased due to a lack of negative samples, 2) novel drug-target associations with new (or isolated) drugs/targets cannot be explored, and 3) the comprehensive topological structure cannot be captured by feature learning methods . Therefore, in the era of big data, the applicant proposes a study to tackle the challenges by achieving two aims. • Aim 1 (K99 Phase): Develop a large scale benchmark for evaluating drug-target prediction based on the  generation of a multipartite network from heterogeneous biomedical datasets. • Aim 2 (R00 Phase): Adapt a deep learning model to build an accurate predictive model based on a novel  feature learning algorithm that mines the multi-dimensional biomedical network (multipartite network). In the mentored phase, the applicant will integrate heterogeneous biomedical datasets and build a benchmark for evaluation of the drug-target prediction based on well-designed strategies. The applicant will receive training in standardization tools for data integration, tools, and skills for data management, evaluation methods for drug-target predictions, and state-of-the-art machine learning/deep learning methods in computer-aided pharmacology. Complementary didactic, intellectual, and professional training will help prepare the applicant for the R00 phase where he will develop a deep learning-based predictive model and multi-dimensional graph embedding methods for feature learning. Together, these novel studies will advance the current computational drug repurposing by providing 1) comprehensive benchmarking for testing and evaluation, and 2) a scalable and accurate predictive model based on a biomedical multi-partite network. The applicant will be mentored by senior, established investigators with substantial expertise in Semantic Web, computational biology, cancer genomics, drug development, and machine learning/deep learning. Importantly, this project will provide a foundation for the applicant to establish independent research programs in 1) computational drug repurposing in real cases, 2) investigation of the diverse hidden associations in system biology (e.g., associations between drugs, genetics, and diseases), and 3) precision medicine aimed applications leveraging biomedical knowledgebases and electronic health records. Project Narrative The field of computational drug repurposing lacks a large scale benchmark that provides comprehensive and standard evaluation tasks as well as a scalable and accurate prediction model that can handle large biomedical datasets. This study aims to utilize Semantic Web technology to construct a multi-partite network based on heterogeneous biomedical databases and develop a deep learning-based predictive model based on the network. The proposed investigation will advance this field by providing a large scale benchmark for evaluation as well as a predictive model based on state-of-the-art technology.",BOND: Benchmarking based on heterogeneous biOmedical Network and Deep learning novel drug-target associations,10054989,K99GM135488,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Base Ratios', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Clinic', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Silver', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genomics', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug development', 'flexibility', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'in silico', 'knowledge base', 'large scale data', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'repository', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool']",NIGMS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K99,2020,100000,0.024230901867808567
"An Integrative Approach to Drug Repositioning Using Decision Tree Based Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite recent advances in life sciences and technology, the amount of money spent developing a single drug has stayed drastically expensive. Overall efficiencies have caused drug development to stay the same, with an average cost of $2.6 billion and 15 years to develop a single drug. Considering these challenges, there is an increased need for drug repositioning, in which new indications are found for existing or unapproved drugs. Here we introduce an approach that integrates only drug similarity metrics, such as side effect, structure, and target similarities, to identify novel indications for drugs. By focusing on drug similarity metrics, our proposed method allows for applications towards orphan molecules that presently have no primary indication. To improve upon the current methods of drug repurposing, we propose the developing of a computational approach that utilizes multiple data types within a machine-learning framework in order to predict indications a drug may treat. Based on the observations that similar drugs are used for similar indications, this method utilizes publicly available databases to identify associations between drugs, and integrates drug similarity data, as well as drug-target specific information, into a machine-learning framework in order to accurately predict indications for these drugs. Altogether, our method provides a novel, broadly applicable strategy that can identify novel indications, allowing for an accelerated and more efficient method for future drug development and repositioning efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Bringing a drug to market requires an enormous amount of time and money, so our proposed research is designed to address this unmet need to streamline the drug discovery process.

"Maximizing the predictive power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens PROJECT SUMMARY We currently have an unprecedented ability to profile the genetic- and pathway-level changes that occur in cancer. Yet, clinicians lack the diverse arsenal of drugs needed to treat subpopulations of patients more effectively, reduce side effects and offer second-line treatment when drug resistance emerges. There is a pressing need to dramatically increase the repertoire of drugs available to fight cancer. Advances in automated microscopy and computer vision, allow the widespread use of phenotypic profiling in early drug discovery. In this grant, we address two challenges. First, the power of phenotypic profiling has led to a growing number of large, disparate image datasets. In aim 1, we will develop machine-learning approaches that combine disparate datasets to obtain accurate predictions of uncharacterized compound function. Second, phenotypic screens can identify candidate compounds across multiple, diverse pathways, but often only use a single cancer cell line. In aim 2, we will develop strategies to identify minimal collections of cell lines that maximize detection of small molecule activities. Successful execution will: increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing existing phenotypic screening datasets and providing a rational approach for selecting cell lines that maximize the chance of discovering hits in desired pathways. In this proposal, we will develop computational and experimental methods to maximize the power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens. Our studies will increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing screens performed across the world, providing a rational approach for maximizing the chance of discovering hits for diverse pathways in future screens, and identifying novel compounds that expand our ability to perturb cancer-relevant pathways. Our proposal is designed to accelerate the pace of early drug discovery.","Maximizing the predictive power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens",9885647,R01CA184984,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'Research Personnel', 'Structure', 'Time', 'base', 'cancer type', 'chemical genetics', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'druggable target', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'genetic profiling', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'proteostasis', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'small molecule', 'transcriptomics']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,480849,0.036458158464174995
"Novel computational approaches to predict drug response and combination effects Summary Tailoring the most desired therapy to each individual patient is the primary goal of precision medicine. A reliable and robust predictive model of drug effectiveness based on patients' unique genomic background is the key. For decades, communities have been trying to establish the relationship between molecular characteristics and drug response in complex diseases. Over the last decade, a large amount of genomic and epigenomic data together with pharmacogenomics data and response to perturbations data has been generated for many human cell lines through collaborations in the research community. These projects have led to significant therapeutic discoveries and have provided unprecedented opportunities to predict drug response using molecular fingerprints. However, even with great interest and effort in developing computational methods for predicting drug response, the prediction accuracies are at best only moderate. A related but distinct question is to understand the mechanisms of action (MOA) of drugs. Understanding drug MOAs enables characterization of drug side effects and identification of old drugs for new uses (i.e. drug repositioning). The traditional experimental assays to identify MOAs of drugs are expensive and time- consuming. There are three key questions to be addressed in the study. 1. Can novel computational approaches largely improve prediction accuracy of response to single drugs using comprehensive genomic and chemical information? 2. Can computational approaches provide a systematic way to mine genomics and drug response data to generate biological insights into the mechanisms of actions of various drugs? 3. Is it possible to develop an interpretable and accurate computation model to predict drug combination effects using pharmacogenomics data? Inherent features make it very challenging to predict drug response accurately: High-dimensionality of input data, the complex relationship between input features and response data; and heterogeneous drug/compound response patterns across different genetic lineages. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has been making remarkable strides in various applications owing to the rapid progress of “deep learning. In Aim 1 of this study, we will develop novel AI-based approaches to address the computational challenges of improving the prediction accuracy of drug response. In Aim 2 of the study, we will develop a novel computation framework to study of MOA of drugs. In Aim 3, we will develop an interpretable deep-learning based computational framework to predict drug combination effects. In addition, we will develop a user-friendly web portal as an integrated research platform to share the methodology, algorithms and data generated from this proposed study to the research community.

"The Ohio Valley Node of the Clinical Trials Network Drug repurposing for cocaine use disorder (CUD) using a combined strategy of  artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction and retrospective clinical corroboration PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Aim 1: Identify repurposed anti-CUD drug candidates using an AI-powered drug discovery approach Leveraging the unique and large-scale drug and disease phenotypic relationship knowledge bases that we have built and vast amounts of publicly available genetics and genomics data, we propose to develop an AI- powered drug repurposing system to identify anti-CUD drug candidates from all approved drugs. The output from Aim 1 is a list of promising repurposed anti-CUD candidates with interpretable mechanisms of action. Aim 2: Fine tune repurposed candidates by predicting their blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability We will determine the BBB permeability of repurposed anti-CUD candidates identified in Aim 1 using a novel machine learning predictive model that we built, which applies to both small and macro-molecules that penetrate the human BBB through various biological mechanisms. The output from Aim 2 is a refined list of promising repurposed anti-CUD candidates with interpretable mechanisms of action and high BBB permeability in humans. Aim 3: Evaluate repurposed candidates using patient electronic health records (EHRs) We will evaluate repurposed anti-CUD candidates for their efficacy in ‘real world’ patients using patient electronic health record (EHR) data. Currently we have access to EHR data of 73.9 million unique patients including 223,460 patients diagnosed with CUD and 66,050 patients with a cocaine-positive urine drug screen. We will perform large-scale case-control studies to evaluate the efficacy of repurposed candidates in reducing risk, mortality, relapse, ER visits or other adverse effects of CUD patients. The output from Aim 3 is a further refined list of promising repurposed anti-CUD candidates with interpretable mechanisms of action, high BBB permeability in humans, and potential clinical efficacy in ‘real-world’ population. We will closely work with CTN and delineate the most expedient pathway to FDA approval for the identified candidates. We anticipate that these findings can be expeditiously translated into clinical trials in the CTN to benefit CUD patients.

"Machine Learning for Drug Response Prediction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Finding new drugs in the seas of small molecules is a difficult task if no prior information is available. Our broad research goal is to develop innovative and accurate machine learning algorithms to predict the drug responses related to complex human diseases.

One research goal is to understand and predict the cell line-specific responses through integrating a wide range of methods, including the propagation of drug effects via biological networks, matrix factorization of molecular profiles and chemoinformatic analysis of small molecules. We will deploy our algorithms to softwares and web servers, which will inform the downstream experimental design to identify the single and combinatorial drug candidates against human diseases.

"Drug biomarker resources for precise translational research One goal of precision medicine is to select optimal therapies for individual patients based on drug biomarkers as well as disease symptoms/signs 1–3. The clinic has started to treat patients based on biomarkers. Examples include Gefitinib used to treat lung cancer patients with mutant EGFR and Vemurafenib used to treat melanoma patients with the BRAF V600E mutation. Clinical trials have also been tailored to recruit patients with the presence of specific biomarkers. A variety of preclinical studies have been conducted to discover biomarkers of investigational drugs. Recent large-scale molecular profiling of cell lines and pharmacogenomics even enables the prediction of biomarkers in silico. All these confirmed or investigational biomarkers (in silico, preclinical, in clinic) have emerged as critical components in modern translational research. However, our current knowledge about biomarkers is scattered and locked away in different places, including FDA labels, clinical trial descriptions, or publications, presenting a significant barrier to integrating them into knowledge graphs to augment reasoning. Therefore, we propose to create a novel composite knowledge source for biomarker discovery. This new source will improve the quality and quantity of connections between drug-biomarker-disease-patient and synthesize new knowledge for precision medicine research. To comply with established standards and aid the implementation of data/software standards for Translator, we will first develop an ontology to define biomarkers and their relationships with other biomedical entities. Next, we will leverage state of the art deep learning methods to extract biomarkers from publications and clinical trials. We will further adopt a crowd-sourcing approach using a large pool of medical students to manually inspect and curate biomarkers prioritized by our machine learning models. The machine learning models will be iteratively improved through a semi-supervised approach. To ensure high quality of provided knowledge, multiple lines (in silico, preclinical, in clinic) of evidence along with confidence scores will be associated with each biomarker. Through collaborating with NCATS staff, we will link biomarkers to other available resources to augment reasoning. We expect that the resource will be a critical component of a knowledge graph, enabling the query of novel questions related to precision medicine and the building of AI models. For example, can drug x work in a mouse model y where gene z is mutated? In what patient population may drug x be effective? Can drug x be repurposed to treat condition m where the biomarker of drug x is presented? Can we find new drugs/targets for those patients with the absence of the biomarker for the approved drug? Moreover, the labeled and well-curated data along with molecular profiles provide AI-ready resources for novel biomarker discovery that could be further validated by bench scientists. To achieve the goal, we have assembled an outstanding team comprising experts in biology, informatics, machine learning, ontology, and knowledge graph. Through two NIH-funded biomarker discovery projects, PI Dr. Chen has gained extensive knowledge in biomarker discovery, collected compelling use cases with bench collaborators, and built a tool for precision medicine. Co-I Dr. Duesbery, a biologist by training and Director of Research at Spectrum Health System, will lead the inspection of biomarkers using real-world data. By combining expertise of Dr. Krishnan who has built deep-learning methods to annotate disease samples from free-text, and Dr. Ding who specializes in ontology development and knowledge graph construction and mining, the team is well-positioned to accomplish the goals of this project. Potential challenges include the recruitment of domain experts to validate biomarkers for a wide range of diseases, the integration with the data provided in other projects, and the limited data resources to cover all diseases. The exploratory study in the first two segments will enable a better estimation of these challenges. n/a",Drug biomarker resources for precise translational research,10056488,OT2TR003426,"['Adopted', 'BRAF gene', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Funding', 'Gefitinib', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical Students', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Ontology', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'Text', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'crowdsourcing', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'in silico', 'individual patient', 'knowledge graph', 'learning strategy', 'melanoma', 'molecular scale', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'ontology development', 'optimal treatments', 'patient population', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'preclinical study', 'recruit', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NCATS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,OT2,2020,58210,0.010748482606662179
"Predicting Drug Cardiotoxicity Targets Using iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes and Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Drug development and approval is a costly process with nearly $2 billion spent for each drug that is approved. One of the most significant contributors to this high cost is the expense of developing drugs that fail to pass clinical trials – only 15% of drugs that begin clinical trials are approved for use on humans. A common reason for not reaching the FDA’s criteria for approval is that the drug is classified as cardiotoxic, which cannot be detected during early stages of drug development. One way that drugs can lead to cardiotoxicity is by altering the electrical activity of ion channels that are responsible for the excitation of the heart tissue that pumps blood to the body. Understanding which ion channels, and the extent to which these ion channels are affected is central to determining the cardiotoxicity of a drug. Early-stage predictions of cardiotoxicity are based on animal studies that are poor models of human heart behavior or single-cell electrophysiological studies that falsely assume underlying pathophysiology based on action potential changes. The recent development of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) offers an opportunity to study drug effects on human cells in a preclinical setting. In this study, we hypothesize that fitting a computational iPSC-CM model to voltage-clamp (VC) data acquired before and after drug application provides a means of quantifying unknown drug effects on specific cardiac ion channels. We will address this hypothesis through the following Specific Aims: 1) Use machine learning to design a novel VC protocol that improves the quality of data for hiPSC-CM model fitting. 2) Quantify the change in hiPSC-CM ion channel conductances before and after drug application. We will use machine learning to develop a novel voltage clamp protocol that improves the electrophysiology data acquired from our hiPSC-CMs. The data is optimized to improve predictions of the conductances for all ion channels activated during the cardiac action potential. We can apply this voltage clamp protocol in an in vitro setting before and after drug application, then fit our computational model to each dataset. The change in ion channel conductances, predicted by the model fit, serves as an estimate of the channel-specific effects of the drug. The contributions of this proposal will be significant because it will be the first study to use human cardiac cells to produce quantitative measurements of channel-specific drug targets that may lead to lethal cardiac arrhythmias. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many promising drugs developed to treat a variety of diseases have undesirable effects on the heart, including increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Often, these drugs are not found to have adverse effects until they reach clinical trials, and failure of drugs at this stage of development is very costly. We aim to develop a method that leverages machine learning and human stem cell-derived heart cells to predict drug cardiotoxicity in a pre-clinical setting to substantially reduce the cost of the drug development process.",Predicting Drug Cardiotoxicity Targets Using iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes and Machine Learning,10068266,F31HL154655,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cavia', 'Cells', 'Clinical Trials', 'Closure by clamp', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Targeting', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equation', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Ion Channel', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Standard Model', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'base', 'blood pump', 'cost', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'heart cell', 'human data', 'human model', 'human stem cells', 'human subject', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patch clamp', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'sudden cardiac death', 'voltage', 'voltage clamp']",NHLBI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,39120,0.11478845316568403

In Phase 1 we demonstrated that this representation enables computational models that more accurately predict the chemical properties of molecules than state-of-the-art models, yet are also far simpler to build because they do not require any expert decisions or optimization to achieve high performance. In Phase 2 we will exploit this unprecedented simplicity to develop an intuitive software package that will for the first time enable any chemist or biologist working in drug discovery to create and run their own predictive models – without relying on specialized cheminformatics expertise – yet still achieve or exceed the accuracy of the best currently available techniques. Scientists engaged in drug discovery research from academic laboratories to large pharmaceutical companies rely on computational QSAR models to predict pharmacologically relevant properties and obviate the need to perform expensive, time-consuming assays (many of which require animal studies) for every molecule of interest. Improved models will enable researchers to select lead candidate series more effectively, explore chemical space around leads to generate novel IP more efficiently, reduce failure rates for compounds advancing through the drug discovery pipeline, and accelerate the entire drug discovery process. These benefits will be realized broadly across most therapeutic areas.  We also plan to take the technology one step further, leveraging our chemically rich vector representation to enable the software to creatively suggest novel compounds (which do not appear in the training libraries, screening libraries, or lead series) that outperform the lead candidates simultaneously on bioactivity, ADME/Tox and PK assays . Solving this inverse problem is the Holy Grail of computational medicinal chemistry and has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to understand whether potential new drugs are likely to be both safe and effective, and identify similar compounds that are likely to be safer and more effective against the same target. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. !",Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts,10004481,R44TR002527,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Solubility', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'chemical property', 'cheminformatics', 'computational chemistry', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lead candidate', 'lead series', 'learning strategy', 'melting', 'model building', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'vector', 'voice recognition']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2020,749928,0.0653106390488044
"Using Machine Learning and Blockchain Technology to Reduce Drug Diversion in Hospitals Drug diversion, defined as “the transfer of a controlled substance from a lawful to an unlawful channel of distribution or use,” is a challenging issue in today's healthcare systems. Based on an analysis, the volume of dosage lost due to diversion increased from 21 million in 2017 to 47 million in 2018, a 126% increase. This resulted in over $450M loss to healthcare systems due to drug diversion, a 50% increase compared to 2017. Hospitals and medical centers constitute the single largest category affected by drug diversion accounting for 33% of all cases and 94% of drug diversion incidents involved opioids. Addressing the drug diversion problem is a multi-faceted problem involving many components ranging from provider training to implementation of hardware and software systems to manage access to controlled substances. However, despite recent improvements in controlling and monitoring access to controlled substances, the process of identifying drug diversion is complicated and time consuming. In this Phase I project, we propose to build on our earlier work in machine learning and automated technologies in healthcare and consensus in a distributed and decentralized architecture to develop a technology based on blockchains to track and document transportation and administration of controlled substances in a hospital environment. The proposed system involves using a smartphone app to scan uniquely generated barcodes for vials of controlled substances during the transport process, digitally sign medication transfers between staff using secure digital certificates to eliminate current paper-based systems, and finally document administration of a controlled substance to the patient by scanning the unique barcode assigned to the vial and recording an after administration picture of the empty vial. Specific Aims: 1) Developing and validating an in silico model of drug transport/diversion in the hospital; we will develop a stochastic model of controlled substance vial movement in the hospital between a series of locations at the hospital. The vials are exchanged between these locations by agents that represent clinical staff. 2) Developing a blockchain-based framework to track medications; we will use the Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source blockchain framework geared towards enterprise applications to design and implement a blockchain framework. We will develop a software interface to record data in and retrieve data from the blockchain (and in a potential Phase II, retrieve data from EMRs and automated dispensing cabinets) for further processing. Finally, we will use the in silico model to quantify the computational power and storage requirements for the blockchain framework discussed above; and 3) Development of an algorithm to identify diversion, the goal of this specific aim is to develop a computational engine that uses data (recorded in the blockchain) to detect drug diversion. We propose to use a framework based on machine learning to detect anomalies in data (i.e., drug diversion). !

"A Machine Learning Platform for Adaptive Chemical Screening Project Summary High-throughput screening remains the most common method to identify the primary chemical hits in chemical biology and drug discovery projects. However, large-scale screens are often financially out of reach for many academic labs. The resulting small screens of small chemical libraries often identify few confirmed hits, most of which are unsuitable for medicinal chemistry follow-up. There is a critical need for computational tools that can guide experimental screening at a reasonable cost while exploring far more chemicals. This proposal will develop a computational platform that can be applied to any target or phenotypic system to select compounds for experimental screening from virtual chemical libraries with a billion or more compounds. New machine learning and high-throughput computing methods will navigate this large chemical space strategically and efficiently, improving the quality of the identified compounds. The computationally guided screening can ultimately improve the chemical diversity, target specificity, and stability of the identified active compounds, accelerating and enabling drug discovery across NIH Institutes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop technologies that make chemical screening accessible to more research groups and enable drug discovery in any therapeutic area. Data science techniques can take advantage of existing public bioactivity data in PubChem to help prioritize chemical screening for a new target. In this technology development proposal, the researchers will 1) determine a general initial screening compound set, 2) develop a computationally-guided iterative screening system, and 3) create and experimentally validate an end-to-end high-throughput computing workflow that directs drug discovery for any new target. At each step, rigorous comparisons to experimental results and baseline models will ensure the methods are working as expected and offer capabilities that do not exist in the current state-of-the-art computational methods. The resulting computational platform will improve the efficiency of and reduce the barriers to chemical screening, ultimately making screening for new compounds available to academic research groups in ways and in places where it has previously been inaccessible. Project Narrative The proposed project is broadly relevant to public health as a critical advancement of technology to enable basic biomedical research across therapeutic areas. This effort creates a computational platform to reduce the overall cost and improve the quality of high-throughput screening in any chemical biology or drug discovery project, which will be rigorously compared to existing experimental techniques.

"Rapid Assessment of Drug Abuse from Municipal Wastewater by Smart Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Technique Rapid Assessment of Drug Abuse from Municipal Wastewater by Smart Surface-Enhanced Raman  Scattering Technique PROJECT SUMMARY Rapid assessment of drug abuse from municipal wastewater is a new strategy that can overcome many limitations of traditional surveillance technologies by providing a more rapid and objective measure of drug use, which can alert communities about raising problems in their earlier stage. However, existing detection techniques are almost exclusively based on complex laboratory chemistry analytical equipment such as high-performance liquid chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), which demand tedious sample preparation with expensive reagents and substantive operator expertise. These methods are ill-suited to large scale, frequent monitoring of illicit drugs in municipal wastewater. In this NIH STTR Phase I proposal, E-Lambda LLC together with Oregon State University proposes to develop a rapid, portable, quantitative, and cost-effective assessment technique using smart surface-enhanced Raman scattering (S- SERS). The proposed S-SERS is a disruptive technique enabled by two game-changing innovations in the PI’s research group, targeting practical technical hurdles of portable SERS sensing technique for rapid assessment of drug abuse from municipal wastewater. First, the diatomaceous SERS substrates, which are developed through previously funded research projects, will provide ultra-sensitive, uniform SERS enhancement factors to detect trace level of illicit drugs and the metabolic products using commercial portable Raman spectrometers. Second, advanced machine-learning methods based on quaternion principal components analysis and support vector regression algorithms, will resolve the grand challenges faced by traditional SERS analysis in quantitative sensing. The proposed S-SERS technique is expected to enable quantitative, multi-drug detection including opioid analgesics such as fentanyl, morphine, codeine, heroin, amphetamine, and other synthetic derivatives from municipal wastewater. The new wastewater testing technology proposed herein could provide a widespread and objective picture of drug use that would be consistent, scalable, cost-effective, and complement other epidemiological studies. The team will also work with multiple stakeholders including Benton County Health Department, City of Corvallis, and Oregon State University Accelerator to demonstrate a clear value proposition of the S-SERS technology for rapid assessment of drug abuse from municipal wastewater. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) This project aims to create a smart surface-enhanced Raman scattering (S-SERS) technique, which will enable rapid, portable, quantitative, and cost-effective assessment of illicit drugs from municipal wastewater. Particularly, the proposed technology combines diatomaceous SERS substrates with machine-learning analysis to overcome challenges faced by traditional SERS sensing.

"National Drug Early Warning System Coordinating Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our team enthusiastically submits this proposal to be the next NDEWS Coordinating Center (CC) in response to RFA DA-20-016. The CC is spearheaded by the Cottler Lab (Epidemiology), with investigators from University of Florida's Center for Addiction Research & Education (Nixon, Goldberger, Striley), the Palamar Lab at New York University and the Machine Perception and Cognitive Robotics Lab-Barenholtz) at Florida Atlantic University. Our CC will maintain strong sentinel surveillance efforts while expanding our Early Warning Network sites, adding leading edge indicators that extend beyond lagged city-level data. We will extend the work of NIDA-funded researchers, while harmonizing and analyzing data, with timely and systematic notifications. The new NDEWS CC will work to seamlessly transition on-going efforts, advance methods and approaches, establish and engage a Scientific Advisory Group (SAG), and collaborate with all consortium components to accomplish these Specific Aims: 1) Provide an Early Warning Network of 12 NDEWS sites and 6 Community Epidemiology Workgroup sites for ongoing surveillance of urban, rural, and suburban areas; 2) Utilize established and new key community-level indicators for ongoing surveillance to assess trends in availability, use, and consequences of NPS and known substances, standardized across all sites to facilitate cross-site analyses; 3) Incorporate and leverage novel surveillance methods to ensure early detection of signals of NPS and emerging drug trends, including data from DanceSafe “drug checkers,” Rapid Street Reporting (RSR) with hair testing for NPS exposure, the implementation of a virtual HealthStreet substance user network, and development of an innovative machine learning approach to detect emergence of NPS in real-time through drug retailers (including the “darknet”) and social media platforms; 4) Harmonize standardized indicator definitions for all incoming surveillance data with the input of NIDA, the SAG, and Early Warning Network experts; facilitate cross-site comparability of data; manage quality control; organize, coordinate, and summarize data, and provide organizational and logistical support; 5) Disseminate findings quickly via dashboards modeled after Florida Drug-related Outcomes Surveillance and Tracking System (FROST); push notifications for regular updates and alerts; webinars; virtual Our Community Our Health Town Hall meetings; and traditionally through official reports, peer-reviewed publications, media, and annual reporting at CPDD, and elsewhere; 6) Conduct on-the-ground epidemiologic investigations on topics of immediate crisis or need; 7) Provide operational, administrative, and logistical support to the enterprise and NIDA; and 8) Train the next generation of scientists in NDEWS methodology.  NDEWS has unrealized potential, and with this funding, we will transform the culture so that NDEWS is NIDA's and the field's go-to source for drug trends in the US. It will provide evidence-based prevention and intervention strategies to eventually reduce the harmful effects of substance use around the world.

"Integration of Evolution to Avoid Resistance in Structure Based Drug Design Integration of Evolution to Avoid Resistance in Structure Based Drug Design Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging our therapeutic strategies. Drug resistance occurs as a result of this evolution when drug pressure changes the balance of molecular recognition events, selectively weakening inhibitor binding while maintaining the biological function of the therapeutic target. Disrupting the therapeutic target’s activity is necessary but not sufficient to avoid resistance. We hypothesize that the multi-dimensional landscape of resistance evolution can be elucidated through integration of experimental and computational data to reveal the key pathways and coupled molecular mechanisms to resistance. Furthermore, we hypothesize that this strategy can be incorporated into structure-based drug design to evaluate novel inhibitors.  Resistance occurs under gradual and persistent drug pressure, and interestingly the mutations are not limited to the active site of a drug target, but can occur throughout the enzyme to confer high levels of resistance. The molecular mechanism by which this resistance occurs is not clear. Our aim is to exploit the rich and versatile experimental data, integrating inhibitor potency and crystallographic structures with ensemble dynamics in an internally consistent manner using machine learning to elucidate both the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance and generate predictive models of inhibitor potency.

"Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The high rate of failure in CNS drug discovery, in particular of the first-in-class therapeutics with new modes of action, highlights a clear unmet need to improve the success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders. One well-known issue is the poor ability of current bioassays and animal models to predict the efficacy and side-effects of compounds. In response, there is a steady growth in the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) in clinical trials in recent years. Pharmaceutical companies are incorporating EEG more often in their preclinical drug discovery efforts because the high degree of translatability of EEG from rodents to humans makes it ideal to use in de-risking programs in drug discovery. Moreover, quantitative EEG (qEEG) is an objective measurement of brain activity with a high test-retest reliability and considerable predictive, face, and construct validity. Additionally, well-documented literature shows that certain classes of drugs elicit different EEG fingerprints, suggesting that EEG yields pharmaco-dynamic signatures specific to pharmacological action and can be used to enable classification of drugs based on the effects of the EEG. Further, EEG can be used to rapidly screen compounds for potential activity at specific pharmacological targets and provide valuable information for guiding the early stages of drug development. However, to date, no EEG-based tool is broadly available to be used to predict the therapeutic utility of unknown compounds for drug discovery in psychiatric disorders. In order to develop such a tool, PsychoGenics, Inc., is leveraging our existing expertise in performing high-throughput pharmaco-sleep-EEG studies and our established proprietary machine learning approach to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications or underlying mechanism of action (MOA; i.e. the neurotransmitter system/receptor targets) of unknown compounds for psychiatric disorders. Our aims are 1) to generate a quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) database of compounds with a known mechanism and therapeutic value in mice, and 2) to develop a classifier using supervised machine learning. The success of this Phase I SBIR project will result in a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications and MOA of new compounds based on their EEG profiles. In a future Phase II project, we will 1) add in auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) database, 2) test our EEGCube by conducting a phenotypic drug discovery project with our established collaborator (see letters of support), 3) investigate whether integrating the EEGcube database with our SmartCube® database of same compounds helps better understand the circuitry responsible for behavioral responses and/or achieves even greater prediction power in identifying therapeutic indication of novel compounds and 4) explore EEG signatures of transgenic mouse models of disease and investigate use of their signatures to identify potential therapies for the respective diseases based on EEG. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an unmet need to improve success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders due to the high rate of failure. Given the high degree of translatability of electroencephalogram (EEG) from rodents to humans, PsychoGenics, Inc., proposes to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications, underlying mechanism of action, and/or compound liabilities to guide the early stages of drug development.","Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders",9983443,R43MH121136,"['Animal Model', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Auditory Evoked Potentials', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacologic Actions', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rights', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'clinically relevant', 'drug classification', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'side effect', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NIMH,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2020,88432,0.08505520920043394
"Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis Project Summary Clinical trials are foundational to evidence-based medicine, but results reporting from trials is incomplete and frequently delayed. It is estimated that as many as half of clinical trials are not published and as many as half of published trials underreport or misreport outcomes. This type of results reporting distorts the evidence available to clinicians—particularly when it comes to assessing the safety of interventions like drugs and devices—and may place patients at unnecessary risk. There is a critical need for novel methods to identify and monitor drug safety data. Through the infrastructure provided by ClinicalTrials.gov, structured trial results (including safety findings) are now becoming available for an increasing number of trials in a comprehensive and timely fashion. However, access and use of these data in evidence synthesis tasks remain limited. ClinicalTrials.gov is the largest single registry for clinical studies worldwide and includes more than 260,000 registered studies. Of the 108,941 completed trials registered with the site, 20% have uploaded results data for a total of 7.85 million participants. Results data reported on ClinicalTrials.gov have the potential to fill gaps created by delays and biases in published articles and provide an earlier and more complete overview of available trial evidence. We propose to develop novel informatics approaches based on combinations of information retrieval and machine learning methods to facilitate access and analysis of trial results reported in this registry. Focusing on trials testing drug interventions in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and oncology, we perform this work in three specific aims: 1) Develop semi-automated trial screening for identifying and aggregating trials relevant to a clinical intervention; 2) Extract adverse event and safety outcomes data from results reported in the registry; and 3) Perform validation studies to assess detection of adverse events and performance of semi- automated meta-analyses of safety outcomes. Methods developed in this project will facilitate timely, broad- scale use of trial results reported on ClinicalTrials.gov in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data. All methods will be made publicly available in order to support adverse event monitoring and systematic reviews of drug interventions. Project Narrative The availability of results from clinical trials is frequently incomplete or delayed, limiting the evidence available to clinicians making treatment decisions. When results on the safety of interventions, such as drugs, are not properly disseminated, patients may be exposed to harm. National policies require comprehensive and timely reporting of trial results in trial registries (e.g. ClinicalTrials.gov), representing a novel data type that could be used for drug safety surveillance. However, the use of these data has remained limited to date. We propose innovative informatics methods to enable access and analysis of this emerging data source in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data.",Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis,9882529,R01LM012976,"['Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Bibliographic Databases', 'Bibliography', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consumption', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug usage', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse event monitoring', 'base', 'cluster trial', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'drug testing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medication safety', 'novel', 'rosiglitazone', 'safety outcomes', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'trial design', 'validation studies', 'vector']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,328000,0.03628187009531532
"A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis PROJECT SUMMARY This project will address the critical need for new and effective antitubercular drugs. Our primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis tolerates antitubercular drug treatment. Our motivating hypothesis is that M. tuberculosis tolerates drug induced stress by differentially regulating detoxification enzymes, efflux pumps, metabolic activity, pellicle-forming factors, and cell wall remodeling systems. Further, we postulate that a secondary drug targeting one or few regulators of these tolerance strategies will potentiate the primary drug-treatment, and potentially reduce the emergence of resistance. We propose a systems biology approach to generate a network perspective of drug-induced tolerance mechanisms and how they are coordinated by one or few regulators that could be targeted for overcoming drug-specific tolerance using combinatorial treatment regimens. Hence, the innovation of our proposed research emerges from integrating network characterization of drug- specific tolerance mechanisms into the rational discovery of novel drug combinations. In Aim 1, we will transcriptionally profile M. tuberculosis following treatment with ten selected drugs (primary drugs). Using techniques developed in our laboratory, differentially expressed genes will be mapped onto a systems-scale gene regulatory network model of M. tuberculosis to infer drug-specific tolerance sub-networks and elucidate key regulators. We will also identify tolerance sub-networks by generating genome-wide fitness profiles in the presence of the selected primary drugs. Drug-associated fitness defects will reveal genes that are important for dealing with drug-induced stress and are hypothesized to cluster together in drug-specific tolerance sub-networks. In Aim 2, we will transcriptionally profile ~250 secondary drugs and perform combination high-throughput screens of all primary and secondary drug combinations. Data from these studies will be used to iteratively refine the model and develop a machine learning algorithm to identify gene- and network-level features that are predictive of synergistic drug interactions. Finally, mechanism of synergistic drug combinations will be characterized by selectively perturbing the predicted regulators of the tolerance sub-networks. This project will propel the development of systems biology tools to accurately predict novel synergistic drug combinations, thereby guiding experimental assessment and accelerating the delivery of new treatments to patients with tuberculosis infection. PROJECT NARRATIVE Treatment of tuberculosis infection (responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually) is complicated by the impermeable cell wall structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its intrinsic ability to adapt and withstand drug treatment, a phenomenon called tolerance. Thus, an urgent goal of antitubercular drug discovery is to overcome drug tolerance. This project will deepen our understanding of how M. tuberculosis responds to and thereby tolerates drug treatment and will use this systems-scale understanding to develop a predictive framework for identifying new synergistically acting drug combinations for the treatment of tuberculosis.",A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9827520,R01AI128215,"['Address', 'Antitubercular Agents', 'Cell Wall', 'Cessation of life', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Enzymes', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'combinatorial', 'differential expression', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'fitness', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'response', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transposon sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis drugs', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2020,848588,0.14216128145974083
"Robust Inference from Observational Data with Distributed Representations of Conceptual Relations The need to monitor unintended effects of approved drugs has been highlighted by several recent high-profile events in which fatal side effects of drugs were detected after their release to market. Notoriously, the Cox-2 inhibitor rofecoxib (Vioxx) was withdrawn from market on account of evidence suggesting that treatment with the drug increased the rate of myocardial infarction. More recently, proton pump inhibitors have been identified with a host of previously undetected serious side effects, including chronic kidney disease. Statistical analyses of several sorts of data have been undertaken in an effort to mitigate the morbitidy and mortality resulting from such side effects by accelerating their detection. These include data from adverse event reporting systems, Electronic Health Records (EHR) and administrative claims data, social media communication and consumer search logs. Each of these sources presents challenges related to data completeness, accuracy, quality and representation, as well as the potential for bias. Though methods for combining multiple data sources show some promise as a way to address their particular inadequacies, strongly correlated drug-event pairs emerging from secondary analysis of observational data must ultimately be reviewed by domain experts to assess their implications. As the availability of the prerequisite expertise is limited, there is a pressing need for new methods to distinguish plausibly causal relationships from the large number of false positive associations that may emerge from large-scale analysis of observational data. In the proposed research, we will develop automated methods through which large amounts of knowledge extracted from the biomedical literature are used to constrain the parameterization of predictive models of large data sets. These methods will leverage high-dimensional distributed vector representations of conceptual relations extracted from the literature to integrate extracted knowledge into predictive models of observational data. Our hypothesis is that the predictions that result from such joint models will be both biologically plausible and strongly associated, resulting in more accurate predictions than those that can be obtained through estimation of correlation from observational data alone. The developed methods will be evaluated formatively for accuracy against a set of drug/side-effect reference standards, and summatively for their ability to to predict label changes such as “black box” warnings using historical data and knowledge to estimate their “time-to-detection” of safety concerns. In addition, we will develop and evaluate an interactive interface permitting users to explore the evidence used by the resulting models to make predictions, by retrieving supporting assertions from the literature and statistics from observational data. If successful, the proposed research will provide the means to identify plausible drug-event pairs for regulatory purposes, mitigating consequent morbidity and mortality. In addition, the methods will provide a generalizable approach that can be used to apply knowledge derived from the biomedical literature to draw robust inferences from observational clinical data. Project Narrative The need to monitor unintended effects of medications has been highlighted by several high-profile events in which fatal side effects of approved drugs were detected after their release to market. In the proposed research, we will develop and evaluate methods to identify biologically plausible adverse drug events using both observational data and knowledge extracted from the biomedical literature.

"Social Media Mining for Pharmacovigilance Project Summary Drugs undergo extensive testing in animals and clinical trials in humans before they are marketed for widespread use. Pre-market testing produces reasonably high quality information about the efficacy of the drug as a treatment for the condition for which it was approved, but gives a very incomplete picture of the drug's safety. It is only after a drug is marketed and used on a more widespread basis over longer periods of time that it is possible to identify other effects, such as rare but serious adverse effects, or those that are more common in the special subgroups excluded from the trial (such as pregnant women), or effects of long-term use of the drug, among others. Despite the increase in research in the past years exploring social media data for pharmacovigilance, and the evidence that it indeed can bring forward the patient perspective, there is no systematic approach to collect and annotate such data for research purposes. This renewal builds on our prior research and natural language processing (NLP) methods for social media mining in pharmacovigilance to make the collection of social media data about medication use precise and systematic enough to be useful to researchers and the public, alongside established sources such as the FDA's data and other public collections of drug adverse event data. It presents innovative methods to automatically collect and analyze longitudinal health data, piloting methods for interventions through the same media that can inform the public and help validate the automatic methods. As validation, we include a comparison to an existing reference standard for adverse effects that integrates FDA's data and HER data, as well as specific case studies focused on (Aim 3.1) the use of NSAIDs and anti-depressants in pregnancy and (Aim 3.2) factors for non-adherence.

"Platform for high-throughput biomechanical measurements using metallic islands on boron nitride nanosheets SUMMARY This proposal describes a new platform for high-throughput measurement of mechanical phenomena in cells. The platform is based on a type of strain sensor comprising metallic nanoislands supported by hexagonal boron nitride. Mechanical deformation produces a change in both the electrical resistance and the optical scattering of these sensors. These processes allow the detection of deformations ≤1 ppm (≤0.0001% strain). This unprecedented level of sensitivity permits the measurement of minute forces produced by cells that cannot be measured using existing methods, and the electrical signals can be analyzed rapidly using machine-learning algorithms. While this sensor has a broad range of potential applications in cell biology, we apply it here to a ubiquitous challenge in cardiovascular medicine and drug discovery. In particular, contractile dysfunction in cardiomyocytes is associated with a range of difficult-to-treat cardiomyopathies. In drug discovery, cardiotoxicity (myopathy, arrhythmia, or both) is a leading reason for the failure of drugs during development and aftermarket launch. For some classes of drugs—especially those used in chemotherapy—up to 30% of patients experience heart disease related to their treatment. Indeed, heart failure is the second most common reason for death of cancer patients. There are currently no assays that are both predictive of cardiotoxicity and are of sufficient throughput to implement early in drug development (i.e., when safer drug leads can be selected among analogues). We propose the use of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) bearing various disease-associated mutations as a test case of our nano-enabled biomechanical sensor. In particular, we will construct an array based on a “96-well” plate format combined with high-throughput analysis using a purpose-designed machine learning algorithm in order to measure the forces and kinetics of contractility of the cells. Such a platform would enable large-scale evaluation of disease mechanisms and accelerate therapeutic target discovery by permitting high-throughput, unbiased testing. This application offers the exciting possibility of introducing aspects of the biology of the human heart early in the discovery pipeline. More broadly, the platform we describe offers the potential of answering deep questions about mechanical phenomena in cells—“the mechanome”—which play critical roles in human health. NARRATIVE This proposal describes a platform for high-throughput measurement of mechanical forces in cells, which play major roles in human health. The platform is based on a type of strain sensor comprising metallic nanoislands supported by hexagonal boron nitride.

"A knowledge map to find Alzheimer's disease drugs To stem the rising incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in our aging population, new methods to repurpose and combine drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) are acutely required. This is a challenge, however, because the complex polygenic basis of AD remains opaque, and rational methods to repurpose drugs are in early years, even for well-defined gene targets. To address these problems, we propose new algorithms to integrate data on a very large scale so as to combine evolutionary information and high-throughput experimental observations with the knowledge conveyed by text in the literature. First, to detect disease-relevant genome variations in AD patients, Aim 1 will combine a novel mathematical calculus of mutational landscapes with machine learning, in so doing suggesting primary candidate genes for drug targeting based on signs of mutational selection in cases or controls. Next, to repurpose and combine drugs targeting these genes, Aim 2 will map a large fraction of all that is known about genes, phenotypes, and drugs into a single high-dimensional network that represents their interactions as described in various databases (structured data) and in the literature (unstructured data). The topology of this network will determine the optimal choice of single drug or combination therapy in an approach that can be personalized. Finally, to validate efficacy experimentally, Aim 3 will test both our candidate genes and drugs with state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo screens. Feasibility rests with prior studies on evolution, networks, systems, and text-mining that demonstrate accurate predictions of deleterious mutations and their clinical sequelae and the discovery of drivers of diseases. Broadly, this work will yield proof of principle for a novel quantitative model that integrates fundamental concepts from mathematics and molecular evolution, and for a low resolution but large-scale map of biomedical knowledge in which network notions of distance computed by machine learning identify relevant functional hypothesis that would otherwise be easily overlooked. The result will be a new experimental ability to unravel the genotype-phenotype relationship in Alzheimer's Disease so as to guide drug therapy. Alzheimer's is a devastating disease projected to rise dramatically in our aging population. To develop drugs against it, we propose to train machine learning on the DNA of patients with Alzheimer's to detect genes with abnormal mathematical features in their mutations. Then, we will place these genes in a “map”, which represents a large fraction of biomedical knowledge in a high-dimensional network. The drugs that fall near our genes of interest in this map are our candidates, and experiments will test in cell and mouse models whether they affect the hallmark signs of Alzheimer's.",A knowledge map to find Alzheimer's disease drugs,9975673,R01AG061105,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor', 'Animal Model', 'Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Behavior', 'Calculi', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Equilibrium', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Production', 'PubMed', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'database structure', 'disorder risk', 'drug testing', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'interest', 'molecular modeling', 'mouse model', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision drugs', 'protective factors', 'screening', 'stem', 'structured data', 'success', 'synergism', 'tau Proteins', 'text searching', 'unstructured data', 'virtual']",NIA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,792498,-0.023424273327951366
"Motion Sequencing for Neuropsychiatric Drug Development SUMMARY Neuropsychiatric disorders afflict more than 20% of the global population, resulting enormous personal and societal burdens, including trillions of dollars in total costs. Despite its prevalence and widespread impact, the development of drugs to treat neuropsychiatric diseases significantly lags behind other disease areas. This gap is due primarily to the fact that so few candidate drugs ever make it to the clinic; the average lag time for those that do make it is 13 years, further exacerbating the problem. The success rate for psychiatric drugs is historically low, even as financial investments in the area rise. Developing safe and effective drugs for neuropsychiatric disorders is inherently difficult, as it relies on characterizing the behavioral phenotypes of animal models. Current approaches to this are low-throughput, unreliable, expensive, and minimally informative. Most methods attempt to reduce complex behaviors that depend upon many neural circuits into one or a few quantifiable metrics, which are then used to predict how the candidates will impact the even more complex human nervous system. Syllable Life Sciences was founded on the vision of improving the way we measure and interpret changes in the behavior in the lab to improve pre-clinical drug development. To address this challenge, we have developed a behavioral analysis platform called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq). MoSeq combines machine vision and unsupervised machine learning techniques to objectively identify a set of stereotyped three-dimensional behavioral motifs (rears, turns, head-bobs, runs, pauses, etc.) that encapsulates all the spontaneous actions of mice within a particular experiment. In addition to revealing which motif (termed a “behavioral syllable”) is expressed at each moment, MoSeq identifies the statistics that govern how syllables transition from one to anther over time (“behavioral grammar”). Using MoSeq, therefore, we can comprehensively and quantitatively profile rodent behavior. Our previous work demonstrates that MoSeq directly reflects ongoing brain activity in psychiatry- relevant brain circuits, and that it may significantly outperform more standard methods of phenotyping drug effects in mice. In this SBIR Phase I project, we propose to extend the capabilities of MoSeq and explicitly demonstrate its translational value. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will expand the purview of MoSeq to include neuropsychiatry-relevant circuits; in Aim 2 we will build a behavioral space that describes relationships among drugs spanning the current psychopharmacopeia; and in Aim 3 we will demonstrate the clinical utility of MoSeq by using it to predict clinical trial outcomes. This project will lay essential groundwork for revolutionizing the preclinical pipeline for neuro- and psychotherapeutics. NARRATIVE Syllable Life Sciences is committed to addressing key preclinical bottlenecks that hinder neuropsychiatric drug development. Key to this is to develop more efficient and accurate ways to identify and measure drug impact on behavior in model systems. Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) integrates state-of-the-art 3D cameras and novel machine learning techniques to track changes in rodent behavior in response to drug, and it does so with unprecedented levels of accuracy and temporal resolution.

"Phenotypic assay for drug discovery and personalized medicine based on real-time vibrational spectroscopy enhanced by plasmonic metasurfaces Abstract The goal of this research is to develop a new spectroscopic technique – Time-dependent Infrared Reflection Spectroscopy Assay (TIRSA) – that will enable us to measure the real-time spectral response of a cell to various pharmacological compounds. The uniqueness of TIRSA is that it exploits infrared-reflective plasmonic (gold) metasurfaces to detect, as a function of time, biochemical changes in close proximity of cellular membranes, as well as cytoskeleton reorganization occurring. The optical spectra obtained over the course of several hours after administering the drug will be used to identify its effects on signaling pathways without any labels because vibrational fingerprints of biomolecules are the natural labels. Unlike time-consuming cytotoxic assays, the TIRSA can be potentially as short as several hours, thereby addressing one of the most serious deficiencies of phenotypic assays: their low throughput. Powerful techniques of machine learning (ML) will be used to process the enormous amount of biochemical information obtained by TIRSA, and to conduct supervised and unsupervised data analysis that will be based on large libraries of spectral cellular responses to single-target chemical compounds such as kinase inhibitors and others. New laser-based hardware for TIRSA will enable high sensitivity, time and space resolution. Relevance Statement: The goal of our program is to demonstrate the feasibility of combining time-dependent infrared spectroscopy to determine the Mode of Action (MOA) of various compounds, including apoptosis- inducing cytotoxic compounds as well as kinase inhibitors. We will develop new hardware for laser-based micro- spectroscopy.

"Finding Combinatorial Drug Repositioning Therapy For Alzheimer'S Disease And Related Dementias PROJECT SUMMARY AD/ADRD are highly complex diseases characterized by distinct molecular pathways and neuropathological phenotypes. Unfortunately, the treatment remains at best modestly effective and no new drugs have been approved since 2003. Combinatorial drug therapy for AD/ADRD treatment has not been intensively studied but it is highly promising. We hypothesize that finding repositioned drug combinations through innovative exploration of big data may uncover effective AD/ADRD treatments, with implicit advantages in overcoming drug resistance and targeting multiple biomarkers. We will combine big biomedical data from complementary sources, novel and advanced informatics models, clinical domain expertise, as well as biology knowledge and validation into a coherent framework to tackle AD/ADRD with potential combinatorial drug therapies. In an exponentially larger and more challenging space of combinatorial drug therapy, opportunities are also exponentially larger when compared with traditional single-drug models but many computational challenges need to be carefully handled. We will develop multiple computational models under two philosophical umbrellas, with focuses on quantifiable screening and biological understanding. Our findings will be validated with biological experiments from cell to mouse. If successful, we will significantly advance AD/ADRD research and benefit patients with safe and effective treatment. NARRATIVE The project aims at identifying novel drug combination therapies for AD/ADRD prevention and treatment using advanced informatics methods.

"Pharmacokinetic Tomography for the Measurement of Topical Drug Product Bioequivalence Project Summary The lack of accurate and reliable techniques for visualizing and quantifying the delivery and uptake (pharmacokinetics) of small molecules into the skin has been a major challenge in the development of both new and generic topical drugs. This is particularly true in the measurement of bioequivalence, where a generic drug candidate must be compared against a reference brand-label drug. Current methods, which rely on expensive, destructive, and bulk measurements do not provide the spatial or temporal resolution necessary to extract pharmacokinetic profiles to determine equivalence of drugs at the cellular level over time in human skin. New tools, which allow for direct, real-time quantification of pharmacokinetics non-invasively in humans are needed to drive innovation in the topical drug space. Pharmacokinetic Tomography (PKT) is a method of generated three-dimensional, real-time maps of various molecular species such as lipids, water, proteins and drugs in tissue using spectroscopic imaging techniques. These imaging techniques make use of the intrinsic molecular vibrations of drug molecules to track their uptake quantitatively without the need for labels or alterations to molecular structure. This proposal will develop new coherent Raman imaging tools to create a platform for quantifying the behavior of drugs in ex vivo human skin. This PKT-based platform will be able to measure the uptake of drugs such as antibiotics, kinase inhibitors, steroids, retinoids and NSAIDs in the skin with sub-cellular and sub-second time resolution to glean critical pharmacokinetic parameters needed for drug development and bioequivalence measurements. To compare PKT to an FDA-recognized standard, these PKT imaging will be carried out alongside dermal open flow microperfusion (dOFM), a skin fluid sampling technique that measures the concentration of drugs over time. The multimodal PKT platform, when completed, will be able to measure the bioequivalence of various drugs in situ in human subjects. This research program will specifically develop new imaging toolkits that combine advanced microscopy with state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning analysis techniques to collect and extract pharmacokinetic data. Using a new type of versatile laser, we will create a coherent Raman technique ideal for detection of drug molecules which contain unique chemical structures. In order to broaden the applicability of the platform to a far wider range of potential drug molecules, we will develop a sparse sampling coherent Raman imaging approach that will quantify molecules by their unique combinations of molecular structures. The development and approval of topical generic drugs for treating dermatological conditions has been slow due to the difficulty and cost in establishing bioequivalence of potential drugs using existing pharmacokinetic profiling methods. For this reason, there is a major need for techniques that can enable the direct visualization and quantification of drugs as they flow and accumulate within tissue. This proposal seeks to develop Pharmacokinetic Tomography imaging tools that make use of the intrinsic molecular vibrational properties of drugs to create a platform translatable to human studies for the measurement of drug bioequivalence.",Pharmacokinetic Tomography for the Measurement of Topical Drug Product Bioequivalence,9999520,U01FD006698,[' '],FDA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U01,2020,247507,0.09912325031420013
"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract Drug Treatments and the Impact of COVID-19 on Alzheimer’s Patients and Other Vulnerable Populations Interventions in health policy and care management have the potential to reduce COVID-19 infections and deaths, particularly if they can be targeted to the most vulnerable populations such as patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). In this supplement proposal, we compile information and develop tools that can accelerate and target such interventions. The first aim is to identify the medical and socioeconomic characteristics of people that make them most vulnerable to COVID-19. We create cohorts of patients with ADRD and for other vulnerable populations based on their Fall 2019 characteristics, and follow them through 2020 to identify those at greatest risk of both “direct” COVID-19 outcomes (e.g., critical illness, mortality) and “indirect” increases in non-COVID outcomes. The second aim is an ambitious proof of concept: using natural experiments to shed light on novel drugs to treat or prevent COVID-19 with a particular focus on drugs most heavily used by ADRD patients (e.g., anticholinesterase inhibitors). We will develop and apply a machine learning approach to test the potential effect of drug classes on COVID-19, measured by diagnosis, hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. This supplement is made possible by a unique opportunity: Access to near-real-time Medicare claims data (one-month lag), which CMS appears willing to make available through an expedited data use agreement. The application will supplement an ongoing program project on Improving Health Outcome for an Aging Population, whose overarching aim is to better understand health trends and disparities, determinants of health, and approaches to improving health for an aging population in an evolving landscape. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative This administrative supplement seeks to better understand factors mediating (and exacerbating) the impact of COVID-19 on patient cohorts with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and other vulnerable characteristics.

"Imaging the healing of ocular injury caused by vesicants to identify new therapies Chemical warfare and the use of mustard gas on civilian population poses a major risk. Vesicating agents, such as mustard gas, cause severe damage to the corneas that can result in blindness and severe loss of sight. There are currently limited therapeutic options for treatment of damage caused by vesicating agents. To enable the rapid development of much needed medical countermeasures, the proposed work will test the possibility of drug repurposing. Drug repurposing strategies are based on the identification of new uses for existing drugs. Drug repurposing is a demonstrated successful strategy that can lower the cost of drug development and reduce development time. The key challenge in drug repurposing is the need to identify novel drug-disease relationships. To address this challenge we will deploy a set of innovative microscopy approaches that will provide rich data on the subtle aspects of the impact existing drugs have on corneal healing from chemical injury. Specifically, in Aim #1 we will perform a chemical screen of 770 existing drugs using live, organ culture, image-based assay. Mice corneas will be imaged for 48 hours after wound and sophisticated computer vision algorithm will be used to extract data on stem cell proliferation, cell death, cell migration, and wound closure. In Aim #2 we will construct spatiotemporal cornea-specific cell atlas of migration, proliferation, inflammatory signaling and gene expression response to chemical injury for controls, and drug-treated corneas. The cell atlases will provide a key resource on the process of chemical injury, the mechanism of action of existing therapies, and the mechanism of action of the most promising new drugs identified in Aim #1. Collectively, the results of this work will exploit the possibility of drug repurposing for the treatment of ocular injury caused by vesicants. The resource we will generate, i.e .the information on existing drugs and the detailed cell atlases of the process of healing will build the foundation for the rapid future development of much needed medical countermeasures. Chemical weapons such as mustard gas can cause severe damage to the eye and lead to blindness. Here we will use sophisticated microscopy tools to test how does the eye heal when treating by existing FDA approved drugs and generate an atlas of the cellular response to chemical injury. Our results will support efforts to repurpose existing drugs to provide much needed medical countermeasures to combat chemical warfare.",Imaging the healing of ocular injury caused by vesicants to identify new therapies,9934566,R21EY031283,"['Accidents', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blindness', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chemical Agents', 'Chemical Injury', 'Chemical Warfare', 'Chemical Weapons', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cornea', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dexamethasone', 'Disease', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug usage', 'End Point Assay', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Eye Injuries', 'FDA approved', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Industrialization', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Mechlorethamine', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mustard Gas', 'Organ', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Poison', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Type I Epithelial Receptor Cell', 'Vesicants', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'combat', 'corneal epithelial wound healing', 'corneal regeneration', 'drug development', 'first responder', 'healing', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medical countermeasure', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'response', 'response to injury', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cell proliferation', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment effect', 'wound', 'wound closure', 'wound healing']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2020,185776,0.06249292517350237
"Mechanisms linking neighborhood poverty to problematic adolescent drug use PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Where a child grows up can inﬂuence his or her risk of problematic drug use. Surprisingly, policies and programs designed to improve neighborhood conditions have yielded conﬂicting results in which some children beneﬁt but others are harmed. Understanding the mechanisms by which neighborhoods act to affect problem- atic drug use and how these mechanisms differ across subgroups and cities—that is, understanding where and for whom mechanisms apply—is essential to optimize the effectiveness of future neighborhood interventions. Mechanisms involving mediation by aspects of the school environment have been unexamined, but could prove promising for understanding differential effects of neighborhood on problematic drug use. The objective of this K99/R00 is to identify school-based mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use and to develop statistical methods to understand how mediation effects differ across subgroup and place. This objective contributes to the long-term goal of improving the effectiveness of interven- tions to prevent drug abuse and dependence by tailoring interventions to address the most relevant mechanisms of action for each target population based on place and individual-level characteristics. The K99 phase ﬁlls the following training gaps that are critical to achieving the research objective and long-term goal: 1) methodologic training in causal mediation analysis; 2) subject-matter training in drug abuse and dependence prevention in ur- ban populations; and 3) involvement in real-world school-based interventions to develop methods with practical utility. Aim 1 of the proposed research identiﬁes the school environment mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and adolescent problematic drug use and modiﬁers of those mechanisms. Aim 2 extends a statistical method recently developed by the proposed research team for generalizing intervention ef- fects from one city to another to generalizing mediation effects. Finally, Aim 3 uses the method developed in Aim 2 to identify how the school environment mechanisms mediating neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use differ across major U.S. cities. The proposed research is expected to identify school-based mechanisms underly- ing differential effects of neighborhood poverty on adolescent problematic drug use by subgroup and place using the only study of randomized neighborhood residence. In addition, it is expected to contribute a novel statistical method that incorporates cutting-edge machine learning techniques to identify which mediation mechanisms can generalize across place, advancing translational research. Successful interventions are assumed to work in differ- ent settings, but that is not the case in practice. The proposed research will allow us to predict intervention effects while accounting for differences in population composition and modiﬁers of the mediation mechanism. This will make a signiﬁcant contribution to improving health by informing the design and targeting of future neighborhood interventions to adolescents and places that may be most impacted in terms of problematic drug use prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is to expected to advance understanding of how two important contexts—neighborhood and school—act together to inﬂuence problematic drug use among adolescents, including how these mechanisms differ across adolescent subgroups and places. In addition, the proposed research will result in the development of a ﬂexible statistical method to predict intervention mechanism effects in new target populations, taking into account population composition. Together, these contributions are anticipated to optimize targeting of future interventions to prevent drug abuse and addiction.",Mechanisms linking neighborhood poverty to problematic adolescent drug use,9987966,R00DA042127,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Development', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home visitation', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Schools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tweens', 'Work', 'adolescent drug use', 'base', 'boys', 'bullying', 'career', 'design', 'drug abuse prevention', 'flexibility', 'girls', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'method development', 'novel', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'residence', 'societal costs', 'successful intervention']",NIDA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2020,327835,0.04507962692241187
"Developing a systems biology platform for predicting, preventing, and treating drug side effects Project Summary Adverse drug reactions (ADRs), more commonly known as drug side effects, are estimated to cause over 200,000 deaths in the US annually, are responsible for 6.5% of all hospital admissions, and 28% of clinical trial failures. ADRs are estimated to increase healthcare costs by $136 billion per year in the USA alone. Current safety and modeling efforts that are commonly used in the pharma industry (such as PK/PD) do not elucidate the complex pathophysiology underlying ADRs. These safety and modeling approaches are used predominantly to quantitatively understand exposure-response relationships for clinical dosing, but with a few exceptions do not focus on the cellular pharmacodynamic mechanisms of why drugs cause ADRs. Elucidating the downstream and systemic effects of pharmaceuticals is critical to understanding ADR pathogenesis and developing safer therapies. Drugs can affect multiple proteins and each protein that they modulate may play roles in multiple cellular processes. Systems biology and bioinformatics approaches coupled with machine learning are crucial for understanding the multi-factorial pathophysiology of ADRs. In Phase I of this program, we developed an in vitro transcriptomics based computational platform that 1) predicts drug-side effect liability equivalent to current gold-standard approaches that require considerably more information about the compound and its effects, 2) defines genes that are relevant to ADR pathophysiology, and 3) identifies therapeutically beneficial compounds for the ADR. Based on the computational platform, we discovered a repurposing opportunity for an off-patent, non-FDA approved drug in Parkinson’s Disease that we are currently pursuing towards clinical development. This drug significantly improves levodopa’s efficacy, without exacerbating the drug’s major side effect which often precludes levodopa’s use. In Phase II of this proposal, we will continue to develop and expand the ADR computational platform. Further, we will hone our focus on two key clinically and commercially relevant ADRs: antipsychotic induced tardive dyskinesia and radio-/chemo- therapy induced mucosal inflammation. We will generate rich datasets for these ADRs to both validate our in vitro platform with in vivo data and to understand the pathophysiology of these ADRs at an unprecedented level. Further, we will use the datasets to generate computational predictions for discovering/repurposing drugs to improve safety in psychiatric and cancer treatments. The best predictions will be subsequently tested in vitro and developed through partnerships and external funding mechanisms. Project Narrative Adverse drug reactions, more commonly known as drug side effects, cause over 200,000 deaths in the US annually, are responsible for 6.5% of all hospital admissions, and 28% of clinical trial failures. This proposal will continue development and deploy a computational platform that predict drug side effects' mechanisms for safer drug development and better patient outcomes. The predictive platform will be applied for improving cancer and psychiatric treatments.","Developing a systems biology platform for predicting, preventing, and treating drug side effects",9922312,R44GM121117,"['Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Economic Burden', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Expression Profiling', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Levodopa', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Mucositis', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Radio', 'Reporting', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Tardive Dyskinesia', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'adverse drug reaction', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical development', 'commercialization', 'computational platform', 'data pipeline', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'metabolomics', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-patent', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,"SINOPIA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2020,754478,0.10915162790165232
"A Web Service for Fragment-based Selectivity Analysis of Drug Leads Abstract Significance: To date, no specific therapeutic drug or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of human coronavirus. Better, direct-acting anti-viral drugs and accelerated methods for identifying them are desperately needed. Having a large body of diverse fragment binding simulation data for each SARS-CoV-2 drug target represents a unique opportunity to accelerate preclinical drug discovery for SARS-CoV-2 protein inhibitors. In contrast to testing-based approaches, understanding fragment interaction patterns provides chemists specific mechanistic information to guide lead optimization. We propose to (1) create comprehensive fragment maps for the full suite of SARS-CoV-2 proteins; (2) build automated tools for enumeration and evaluation of compounds that address protease selectivity and inhibition at Spike protein ppi and allosteric sites; and (3) make these available worldwide through the BMaps Web application. As such, all anti-viral researchers can benefit. Innovation: Generating thousands of fragment binding patterns for each of the known SARS-CoV-2 protein structures is a novel scientific approach to the rational design of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. This would be the largest data source of fragment data on SARS-CoV-2 drug targets available and the resource would be accessible by all scientists working to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The innovation proposed is to enable a new scientific approach to rational design for SARS-CoV-2 antivirals based on the analysis of fragment binding patterns using novel compound enumeration and evaluation methods. Aim 1: Generate fragment and water maps for the full suite of proteins involved in the coronavirus life cycle. Using hot spots for location bias, run ~1,000 fragment simulations on each consensus of 6 structures from molecular dynamics. Aim 2: Develop automated tools to accelerate the enumeration and evaluation of candidate inhibitor molecules. Two approaches are proposed: (1) adapt our test software to enumerate all available modifications with all fragments for a given starting point and (2) use a Conditional GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) deep learning network to enumerate inhibitors from fragments, using discriminator networks to bias towards synthesizable molecules with good properties. Aim 3. Build a repository of candidate inhibitors targeting coronavirus proteins through a variety of different mechanisms. Overall Impact: The SARS-CoV-2 protein-fragment maps lead chemists to often non-obvious ideas to progress their compounds toward clinical trials. The ability to automatically enumerate and evaluate compounds from a large fragment map repository enables broad access to target-relevant chemical diversity, without tedious manual searching. A repository of candidate inhibitors targeting coronavirus proteins enables drug researchers to get started quickly. Project Narrative Accessing diverse chemical fragment binding data (1,000s for each SARS-CoV-2 drug target) presents a unique opportunity to accelerate much needed preclinical drug discovery for SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. The fragment-based drug design platform (BMaps, www.boltzmannmaps.com), built under NIH Phase I and II grants, will be extended with fragment maps for SARS-CoV-2 proteins and further automation of compound enumeration through fragment growing. This will empower antiviral drug researchers in attacking the difficult problems of SARS-CoV-2 protease selectivity and inhibitor binding at allosteric or protein-protein interaction sites on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein.",A Web Service for Fragment-based Selectivity Analysis of Drug Leads,10149527,R43GM133284,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Allosteric Site', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Antiviral Therapy', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biotechnology', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Capsid', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Evaluation', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Homology Modeling', 'Hot Spot', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Location', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nucleocapsid Proteins', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Polymerase', 'Property', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteolysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Water', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'human coronavirus', 'influenza M2', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'repository', 'simulation', 'software development', 'tool', 'web app', 'web services', 'web site']",NIGMS,"CONIFER POINT PHARMACEUTICALS, LLC",R43,2020,225000,-0.010110433285628993
"Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization Project Summary  The proposed work will accelerate the pace of drug discovery by developing, validating, and testing new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug design. Two fundamental challenges of structure-based drug design are the accurate scoring and ranking of protein-ligand structures, which identiﬁes active com- pounds, and the ability to efﬁciently search a large number of ligands, which ensures that active compounds are sampled. This proposal will address these challenges by developing a novel approach for protein-ligand scoring and expanding the size of the chemical space that can be efﬁciently searched during lead optimiza- tion. The methods will be validated by their prospective application toward the discovery of new anti-cancer molecules and will be made readily accessible through online resources and open-source tools.  The proposal leverages recent and signiﬁcant advances in deep learning and image recognition to develop scoring functions that accurately recognize high-afﬁnity protein-ligand interactions. This is achieved by design- ing and training convolutional neural nets on three-dimensional representations of protein-ligand structures to discriminate between binders and non-binders. Convolutional neural net training will exploit large datasets of afﬁnity and structural data to automatically extract the relevant features necessary to accurately prioritize compounds. Additionally, the proposal develops the ﬁrst means of fully integrating a convolutional neural net scoring function directly into an energy minimization and docking workﬂow.  Interactive virtual screening enables the search of millions of compounds in a few seconds so that queries can be interactively optimized. Interactivity enables the synergistic uniﬁcation of human expert knowledge and efﬁcient computational algorithms. The proposed work will dramatically expand the size of chemical space ac- cessible through interactive virtual screening. Algorithms for efﬁciently searching the chemical space of billions or trillions of compounds implicitly deﬁned by a set of reaction schemas and fragments will be created as part of a lead optimization workﬂow. Fragment-oriented search will be accelerated by a new data structure that combines pharmacophore and molecular shape information into a single sub-linear time index.  The scoring and lead optimization methods developed in this proposal will be released as open-source soft- ware and made immediately available through open-access online resources. As part of the prospective valida- tion of the proposed methods, these resources will be used to identify hit compounds and optimize leads for two targets related to cancer metabolism: serine hydroxymethyltransferase and kidney glutaminase isoform C. Successful completion of the objectives of this proposal will positively impact public health by reducing the cost and time-to-market of developing new drugs, particularly with respect to novel protein targets. Project Narrative  Researchers will be able to more quickly and accurately identify potential drug candidates using the new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug discovery created by this project. These tools will be readily accessible through open-access web sites and open-source software. As part of the project these tools will be used to identify new molecules that are relevant to the treatment of cancer.","Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization",9857604,R01GM108340,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Glutaminase', 'Glutamine', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RANK protein', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'large datasets', 'lead optimization', 'molecular shape', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'overexpression', 'pharmacophore', 'prospective', 'resource guides', 'screening', 'structured data', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'virtual screening', 'web interface', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,313000,0.03227973233936409
"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,10005116,P50AR070590,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Custom', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Ohio', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Provider', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'Records', 'Records Controls', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Model', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'design', 'differential expression', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'multimodality', 'mycobiome', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'synergism', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIAMS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,P50,2020,1316550,0.03608675108615172
"Omics data integration and analysis for structure-based multi-target drug design Abstract Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), whole genome sequencing, and high-throughput techniques have generated vast amounts of diverse omics and phenotypic data. However, these sets of data have not yet been fully explored to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery, which continues along the one- drug-one-gene paradigm. Consequently, the cost of bringing a drug to market is staggering, and the failure rate is daunting. Our long-term goal is to revive the lagging pharmaceutical pipeline by identifying robust methods for achieving precision medicine. We will achieve this goal by developing a novel structural systems pharmacology approach to drug discovery, which integrates structure-based drug design with heterogeneous omics data integration and analysis in the context of the whole human and pathogen genome and interactome. An increasing body of evidence from both our group and others suggests that most drugs commonly interact with multiple receptors (targets). Both strong and weak multiple drug-target interactions can collectively mediate drug efficacy, toxicity, and resistance through the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. In order to rationally design potent, safe, and precision medicine, we face one of the major unsolved challenges in structure-based drug design: what are all the possible proteins and their conformational states interacting with a drug in an organism? This proposal attempts to address this challenge by developing, disseminating, and experimentally testing novel computational tools. Based on our successful preliminary results, we will develop an integrated computational pipeline to identify three-dimensional (3D) protein-chemical interaction models in the cellular context and on a structural proteome scale. Specifically, we will develop a quaternary structure- centric multi-layered network model by integrating heterogeneous data from genomics, proteomics, and phenomics. We will develop a novel collaborative one-class collaborative filtering algorithm to infer missing relations in the multi-layered network. We will combine tools derived from structural bioinformatics, biophysics, and machine learning to gain biological insights into the drug action. To facilitate the usability and reproducibility of the proposed algorithms, we will develop community-based web resources established by our previous experiences in developing the Protein Data Bank (PDB). More importantly, we will work closely with experimental laboratories to test the proposed computational tools using targeted kinase polypharmacology as a real-world example, and iteratively improve the performance and usability of algorithm, software, and web services. The successful completion of this project will provide the scientific community with: (1) new methods to enhance the scope and capability of high-throughput screening for structure-based multi-target drug design; (2) a user-friendly web service to support community-based drug discovery; and (3) potential novel anti-cancer targeted therapeutics. Together, these tools will advance drug discovery and precision medicine by providing a structural systems pharmacology toolkit. Relevance Statement The pharmaceutical industry is in a dire state. Both the cost to launch a new drug and the attrition rate are increasing. Methods that can correlate drug-target interactions with clinical outcomes will reduce both the cost of drug development and mortality rates during clinical trials and treatments.",Omics data integration and analysis for structure-based multi-target drug design,9961619,R01GM122845,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Big Data Methods', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Docking', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Extracellular Protein', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'anti-cancer therapeutic', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer therapy', 'cellular targeting', 'computational pipelines', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'drug action', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'heterogenous data', 'high throughput screening', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'pathogen genome', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'receptor', 'side effect', 'small molecule', 'structural genomics', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web services', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,HUNTER COLLEGE,R01,2020,343028,0.10052593592068643
"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects.

"Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, having eclipsed motor vehicle-related deaths in 2008. A number of interventions have emerged in the last decade in response to this epidemic, including prescription drug monitoring programs; improving linkages to drug treatment; training drug users and those around them to recognize and respond appropriately to overdose; and, most recently, training and equipping law enforcement officers to use naloxone (an opioid antagonist) at the scene of an overdose. Equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone is intended to capitalize on the fact that officers often arrive at an overdose scene before other emergency services, particularly in rural areas, and until now have not been well equipped to deal with overdose events. In the last 5 years, with the active encouragement of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Department of Justice, law enforcement agencies in at least 28 states are planning to or have begun carrying naloxone to use when they attend overdoses. Despite the proliferation of such programs, this intervention is completely unstudied. In 2014 the San Diego Sheriff's Department began training patrol officers to use naloxone to respond to overdose prior to arrival of other emergency services, and to actively refer overdose victims to a collaborating drug treatment agency after revival. Uptake of drug treatment has been higher than expected (3 of 9 revivals in the 6 month pilot phase of the project entered treatment). We hypothesize that the moments after an overdose represent a ""teachable moment"" in which drug users may be more motivated to enter treatment. In addition, we hypothesize that having law enforcement officers respond to overdose as a medical emergency rather than as a crime scene may make drug users more willing to call 911 when someone overdoses. The overarching goal of this study is to determine the impact of law enforcement use of naloxone to respond to drug overdoses on two primary outcomes: (1) uptake of drug treatment referrals by overdose victims referred by law enforcement officers, and (2) rates of calling 911 to summon emergency medical services by drug users who witness overdoses. We will achieve these aims through a mixed methods study that includes secondary analysis of data available through our partnership with SDSD, their drug treatment partners the McAlister Institute, and the County of San Diego, including 911 dispatch data, SDSD case records, and treatment data. To complement these data we will conduct qualitative interviews with a community-recruited sample of drug users, to assess their perspectives around treatment referrals provided by SDSD Deputies, and their willingness to call 911 in the event of witnessed overdoses. Interviews and analysis will utilize methods drawn from grounded theory and ethnographic decision tree modeling (a rigorous qualitative method used to describe how individuals and organizations make decisions in given situations). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, with more people dying of overdose than in motor vehicles. One recent response to such deaths is equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone (an overdose antidote which can be sprayed into an overdose victim's nose), and training them to refer overdose victims to drug treatment once they are revived. This study will look at the use of naloxone by the San Diego Sheriff's Department, and will be the first research project in the world to investigate whether or not having law enforcement officers refer drug users to treatment immediately after an overdose is effective, and whether or not having law enforcement officers respond to an overdose as a medical emergency rather than a law enforcement issue makes drug users more likely to call 911 when someone overdoses.",Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health,9883766,R01DA040648,"['911 call', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Antidotes', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'County', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Drug Controls', 'Drug user', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnography', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Fatality rate', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Lawyers', 'Life', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Naloxone', 'Natural experiment', 'Nose', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Organizational Decision Making', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'base', 'design', 'empowered', 'first responder', 'health goals', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'peer', 'prescription monitoring program', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'rural area', 'secondary analysis', 'side effect', 'theories', 'uptake', 'willingness']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,464512,0.09057267786396811

"Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens ABSTRACT Patients with atrial fibrillation, post-acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism are prescribed antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet agents and oral anticoagulants) in dual and triple combinations. These drugs independently cause gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from mucosal defects or vascular abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiac patients are the fastest growing at-risk group due to the rapidly aging US population, their high-burden of co-morbidity, frequent antithrombotic polypharmacy and prescription of new antithrombotic drugs with higher incidence of GI adverse events. The real-world GIB risk of antithrombotic agents used in combination in a diverse cardiac population has yet to be characterized. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated poor performance of existing risk scores (HAS-BLED, CHA2DS2-VASC etc.) for the prediction of non- warfarin antithrombotic drug bleeding; scores frequently used in the clinical setting despite their inaccuracy. Absence of knowledge regarding the real-world risk of antithrombotic-GIB, and the inability to accurately predict which patients will bleed, hampers patient counselling regarding a frequently occurring adverse event which is known to cause morbidity and mortality among cardiac patients. We propose to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying GIB risk in a large, geographically diverse cohort of elderly and non-elderly cardiac patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism or post-acute coronary syndrome. GIB associated with antithrombotic drug combinations will be stratified by underlying cardiac conditions; incidence rates (events/100 patient-years) and propensity-matched Cox proportional models (with 95% confidence intervals) will be used to estimate outcome. We will examine heterogeneity of safety effects related to age, chronic co-morbidity, and hepatic or renal dysfunction. Machine learning techniques will then be used to derive and validate a highly sensitive algorithm for the prediction of antithrombotic-related GIB. Discovery of such an algorithm is the first step in the future application of a predictive model in any evidence-based clinical delivery platform, such as a decision rule or risk calculator. NARRATIVE Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in cardiac patients is common, deadly and on the rise due to an older population, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs used in combination, and availability of new drugs with higher GIB risk than their predecessors. Lack of data regarding the magnitude of GIB and limited knowledge of which patients are most at risk, prevents accurate counselling regarding cardiac drug safety. We will quantify this risk, study risk factors; and use machine learning techniques to derive and validate a clinical algorithm to better predict at-risk patients.",Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens,9916670,R01HS025402,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R01,2020,394737,0.025114962061565386
"Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a suite of software modules to enable scientists to unambiguously represent chemical mixtures in standard machine-readable formats, filling an urgent and widely-recognized need. Chemicals are typically formulated as mixtures. Recording and communicating infor- mation about chemical mixtures is essential for scientists and support staff in the pharmaceutical industry, in academia, in non-profit research organizations, in government, at specialty chemical vendors, and at commer- cial manufacturers to: • discover, develop, formulate, manufacture and regulate drugs; • manage reagent inventories; comply with laboratory safety requirements; inform first responders; • describe and reproduce biomedical experiments; and • assess and disseminate information about toxicity risks of chemical reagents and consumer products.  A working committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is close to for- malizing “Mixtures InChI” (or MInChI), which will extend the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) to be- come the first standard to encompass mixtures. MInChI will effectively index mixtures in the same way that InChI indexes individual compounds.  In Phase 1 CDD developed the data structures and software necessary to enable adoption and utilization of MInChI and create the first general-purpose system for recording information about chemical mixtures that is computable and interoperable. In Phase 2 CDD will continue to develop a sophisticated automated transla- tion tool that will accurately convert legacy catalogs of chemical mixtures from plaintext descriptions or ad hoc formats so that they are properly represented in a machine readable format that can in turn be easily rendered into MInChI identifiers. The broad vision is to help industry to overcome the barriers to adoption so that ma- chine readable mixture descriptions can quickly deliver benefits for drug discovery, chemical safety, and toxi- cology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accu- rately document the composition of chemical mixtures in a format that computers can easily interpret, process, and exchange. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. It will also help to advance our understanding of the toxicol- ogy of mixtures (which often differs from the toxicology of individual components) and improve laboratory safety both in industry and in educational settings. !",Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation,9902210,R44TR002528,"['Academia', 'Adoption', 'Ally', 'Books', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Commercial Catalogs', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Readability', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shorthand', 'Solvents', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Traction', 'Translations', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'first responder', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'male', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'quality assurance', 'structured data', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2020,748733,0.03573696214315158
"Novel Wearable and Wireless Scratch Sensor as a Drug Discovery Tool Itch leads to serious impairment of quality of life—often times on par with pain. Itch is the hallmark symptom and primary driver of morbidity for atopic dermatitis (AD)—one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases affecting 24 million adults and 10 million children in the U.S. Currently, there is a severe lack of objective measurement of itch. Psychometric surveys are point measurements that lack sensitivity and validity—particularly in children. Measuring itch-related scratching behavior offers a potential objective way to measure itch. Unfortunately, wrist strapped electronics fail to capture scratch accurately and are not adapted for children. This project seeks to accelerate the full qualification of a novel, wearable sensor leveraging a machine learning algorithm to objectively and accurately measure scratching. We propose to address key comments from the FDA in our accepted letter of intent (DDT COA #000120) by accomplishing the following specific aims. Aim 1: we will augment our current scratch sensor to achieve 7-day battery life on a single wireless charge (current battery life: 24 hours) to increase adherence and reduce user burden. Aim 2: we propose to extend healthy normal testing to strengthen our predictive algorithm and train against additional cofounders with an additional 8 subjects (n=16 total). In addition, we will improve the usability and cybersecurity of our software and cloud system. Aim 3: we will extend our existing clinical study at Northwestern University to include more pediatric and adult individuals with AD (n=30 target total). Psychometric surveys will assess user/caregiver experience afterwards, and determine which features of the sensor have greatest value to patients. Success will be defined by successful submission of a full qualification plan to the FDA within 12 months as a fully accepted drug discovery tool. The long- term goal is to make this scratch sensor widely available to support drug development by providing an objective endpoint for itch, and inform future clinical care of treatment response in a patient’s naturalistic environment. Further applications include deployment in other itchy conditions (e.g. prurigo nodularis, chronic pruritus of the elderly, pruritus associated with renal or hepatic failure). Itch is a profoundly disturbing symptom that greatly reduces quality of life. For Atopic dermatitis (eczema) sufferers, a disease that afflicts 10% of children and 4% of adults in the U.S., itch is the greatest source of morbidity. However, there remains a lack of objective, repeatable measurement tools for itch hindering drug development. Measuring scratch behavior offers one opportunity to quantify itch. This project will support efforts to fully qualify an accepted letter of intent for a novel wearable scratch sensor as a drug development tool (COA# 0001120).",Novel Wearable and Wireless Scratch Sensor as a Drug Discovery Tool,10146184,U01FD007001,[' '],FDA,"SONICA, LLC",U01,2020,249103,0.011943810751972848
"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9908105,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Route', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serine containing aminolipid', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,291940,0.03971401977338835
"Utilization of Phenotypic Precision Medicine to Identify Optimal Drug Combinations for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma PROJECT SUMMARY  The authors have developed a computational platform to rapidly identify optimal drug and dose combinations from the innumerable possibilities. By testing this technique termed Phenotypic Personalized Medicine (PPM) in a diverse number of experimental systems representing different diseases, they have found that the response of biological systems to drugs can be described by a low order, smooth multidimensional surface. The main consequence of this is that optimal drug combinations can be found in a small number of tests and that translation from in vitro to in vivo and ultimately to clinical application is enabled through a re- optimization process. This input–output relationship that is always based on experimental data in lieu of predicted responses may also lead to a straightforward solution for handling human diversity in cancer therapeutics, among other diseases. In these series of studies they will test the hypothesis that PPM can be developed and validated for clinical use by using it to find novel drug combinations of repurposed/repositioned drugs to treat hepatocellular carcinoma. The goal is that by the end of year 3 of this project, they will be able to initiate a clinical trial using these novel combination or combinations.  This group has previously used PPM-based optimization to find novel drug combinations in in vitro and in vivo models of cancer and infection. They have shown that this approach was able to markedly improve the efficacy of colorectal cancer therapy in vivo in mouse models. Translationally in a first-in-human clinical trial, they recently completed a prospective clinical study involving 4 PPM-dosed patients and 4 control (standard of care dosed) patients. They calculated the tacrolimus dosing regimen using the PPM process. Because PPM does not require a priori knowledge of disease mechanism and because it is a dynamic process that can accommodate a changing system, it can efficiently find personalized drug dosing over a varying range of time, having a profound stabilizing effect on the tacrolimus trough levels.  For this application, they have selected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, liver cancer) to be the human disease for PPM application. The key rationale for this clinical selection is that they have a wealth of in vitro data on HCC, an active HCC tumor biorepository, and a large clinical volume of patients with HCC. These existing resources, both in vitro and clinical, allow for the immediate exploration of combination discovery followed by a clinical validation of discovered combination candidates in patients with unresectable HCC. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project applies a computational platform (Phenotypic Precision Medicine) to optimize combination therapy for the treatment of liver cancer. Using empiric measurements of the responses to a given treatment regimen by liver cancer cell lines and mouse models, they will demonstrate a computational approach to finding and optimizing novel drug combinations using repurposed/repositioned drugs. First they will demonstrate the ability to devise novel combination therapies and then they will start planning for a clinical trial to test the feasibility and efficacy of this approach to the treatment of liver cancer.",Utilization of Phenotypic Precision Medicine to Identify Optimal Drug Combinations for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma,9829406,UH3TR002087,"['BAY 54-9085', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer cell line', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Regimen', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Unresectable', 'Validation', 'Xenograft procedure', 'appropriate dose', 'base', 'biobank', 'biological systems', 'clinical application', 'colorectal cancer treatment', 'combinatorial', 'computational platform', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'first-in-human', 'hepatocellular carcinoma cell line', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'personalized medicine', 'precision drugs', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'process optimization', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tumor']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,UH3,2020,152462,0.03633719193222451
"Genetic analysis of endocannabinoid signaling in C. elegans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) – comprising the endocannabinoids, their G-protein coupled re- ceptors, and their metabolic enzymes – is one of the most important physiological systems involved in estab- lishing and maintaining human health. In some illnesses, ECS dysregulation is an element of disease pathol- ogy whereas in others it is believed to be protective. Thus, there is intense interest in developing pharma- cotherapies that target the ECS to blunt its pathologies or harness its protective effects. One of the main challenges in developing new drugs that target the ECS is the problem of side effects, con- sistent with the nearly ubiquitous expression of this signaling system. Current efforts to increase the functional specificity of ECS drugs include preventing them from crossing the blood brain barrier, and targeting ancillary ECS proteins which modulate principal ECS components without being direct effectors themselves. Until now, discovery of ancillary proteins has proceeded mainly by inference from prior knowledge obtained from isolated cells. This approach can be limiting because knowledge of the underlying genetic and biochemical networks is usually incomplete. Here we propose to develop new high-throughput methodologies to enable the first unbi- ased genetic screens to identify new ECS molecules in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans is an omnivorous bacterivore but it learns to prefer some species of bacteria more than others. We recently discovered that one of the worm's endocannabinoids increases the worm’s appetite for favored foods over less favored foods, a phenomenon called hedonic amplification. We propose this system as a genetically tractable model of cannabinoid effects on appetitive behavior, providing an easily screenable phenotype that directly corresponds to a well-known human behavior. The research develops two high-throughput microfluidic systems for quantifying hedonic amplification in C. ele- gans. The systems are then utilized to perform two small-scale genetic screens as a prelude to future large- scale screens. In the first, hedonic amplification will be quantified in strains in which homologs of known mam- malian ECS components have been knocked out; this screen further validates the C. elegans ECS as a mam- malian model. In the second screen, hedonic amplification will be assessed in a select set of wild isolate strains of C. elegans to estimate the heritability of this phenotype. The research is significant because it could ultimately lead to the discovery of novel drug targets to mitigate disease and promote health. Cell-to-cell signaling mechanisms involving endocannabinoids are involved in numerous physiological and psy- chological conditions including nausea, obesity, pain, anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and neu- rodegenerative disease where they can be part of the disease or the body's protective response to it. However, most attempts to harness the therapeutic potential of endocannabinoid signaling have been stymied by prob- lematic side effects. The proposed research develops and applies innovative methods to screen for genes en- coding new members of the endocannabinoid signaling system as potential drug targets for treatment of endo- cannabinoid-related diseases, with fewer and milder side effects.",Genetic analysis of endocannabinoid signaling in C. elegans,9966951,R21DA047645,"['Action Potentials', 'Anxiety', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cells', 'Chemotaxis', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Enzymes', 'Fire - disasters', 'Food', 'Food Preferences', 'Future', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heart', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Ingestion', 'Invertebrates', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Muscle', 'Mutagenesis', 'Names', 'Nausea', 'Nematoda', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Obesity', 'Operating System', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Organ', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Pump', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'anandamide', 'base', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'cell type', 'design', 'endocannabinoid signaling', 'endogenous cannabinoid system', 'feeding', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic strain', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'hedonic', 'innovation', 'interest', 'loss of function mutation', 'marijuana use disorder', 'member', 'mutant', 'neural circuit', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'preference', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'trait']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2020,184375,0.0009841065206781768
"Assessing the power of primary drug-screens to predict clinical response. PROJECT SUMMARY Precision oncology relies on the hypothesis that further characterizing a patient's tumor will lead to better predictions of treatment response. While this approach effectively breaks diagnoses into smaller and smaller subtypes likely to respond to a given targeted inhibitor, the downside is it results in highly fragmented clinical data spread across multiple treatment arms. The more progress the field makes in assigning new therapies, the harder it will be to accrue adequate sample size to test another therapy. Direct screening of cancer cell lines and primary samples on panels of targeted inhibitors is a uniquely promising approach to this problem, turning every patient sample into a hundred mini experiments, but clinical validation of in vitro drug-response predictions have been hampered by limited numbers of patients who are screened and actually treated with any given drug. Such an evaluation is critical to determine the predictive value gained from drug screening of patient samples. Over the past seven years the Knight Cancer Institute has performed drug screening paired alongside genomic and/or RNA sequencing for over 600 primary leukemic samples. Within two years, we will have accumulated over 200 patients not only screened for in vitro drug response but then treated with matched targeted inhibitors. I will leverage this existing and growing dataset to interrogate the power of in vitro drug screening data to predict clinical response using retrospective data. I will establish a robust framework for primary drug screening and analysis, build interpretable models for clinical decision making, and explore mechanisms controlling drug response. This project will result in improvements to high-throughput drug screening, a thorough accounting of the predictive power of in vitro drug screening, and candidates for treatment combinations in resistant tumors. My goal is to become an independent investigator and cross-disciplinary leader in patient sample multi-omic profiling, targeted therapy selection, and translational oncology. During my mentored phase I will be receiving guidance from Dr. Emek Demir, an expert in computational modeling of systems biology, Dr. Jeffery Tyner, a leader in patient sample drug screening and validation, and Dr. Brian Druker, a pioneer of targeted cancer therapy and director of the Knight Cancer Institute. I will also improve my statistical understanding of complex systems by working with my advisory committee member Dr Tomi Mori, learn to integrate large datasets and predicting patient outcomes from Dr. Shannon McWeeney, and improve upon existing drug screening platforms and analysis methods with Dr. Laura Heiser. I am determined to attain an independent faculty position and my mentors have committed to assisting me in the application and transition process. PROJECT NARRATIVE A promising field of cancer treatment is targeted therapy, where each patient is prescribed different drugs precisely based on the features of their cancer. We have a large dataset of patients where we tested drugs on their cancer cells in the lab, and later the patient received the same drug as part of their therapy. I will investigate the best methods for testing drugs on each patient's cancer, how effective these tests are for predicting how well a treatment will work in each patient, and why some patients don't see the benefit from targeted therapy we normally expect.",Assessing the power of primary drug-screens to predict clinical response.,9881199,K99CA245896,"['ABL1 gene', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Aftercare', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Committee Members', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Screening', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'German population', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'care outcomes', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'conventional therapy', 'design', 'drug response prediction', 'drug sensitivity', 'drug testing', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'high-throughput drug screening', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'large datasets', 'leukemia', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'model design', 'multiple omics', 'multitask', 'new combination therapies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient screening', 'patient stratification', 'phosphoproteomics', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'response', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'survival prediction', 'targeted agent', 'targeted cancer therapy', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'validation studies']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,137488,0.034608032427175674
