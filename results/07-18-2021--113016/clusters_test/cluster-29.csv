"Transcriptional Regulatory Networks of Craniofacial Development Abstract Human craniofacial development is a complex process and frequently goes awry to cause a major class of birth defects, orofacial clefting, which affects approximately 1 in 700 live births. Proper facial development in mouse and human requires three sets of paired facial prominences coming together by growth, morphogenesis, and fusion. Embryonic facial development is strikingly similar in human and mouse, making the mouse the best available model system for human. Previous studies have shown that the expression of many thousands of genes changes across tissue layer, age, and/or prominence, as well as cell population during early mouse facial development. However, we still only have a rudimentary understanding of how these changes are regulated by the interaction of transcriptional modulators in the developing face. To understand how genes are transcriptionally regulated during facial development, this research seeks to construct transcriptional regulatory networks in a temporospatial manner by in silico analysis of publicly available multi- omic datasets. Aim 1 will focus on the identification and verification of transcriptional regulatory networks operating in facial mesenchyme with a focus on super-enhancers. Aim 2 will adopt a similar approach to study the ectoderm which acts as a vital signaling center for the mesenchyme. Finally, in Aim 3 I will apply knowledge from Aims 1 and 2 to build transcriptional regulatory networks at the single cell level. These aims will take advantage of available RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, histone marker ChIP-seq, transcription factor ChIP-seq, bulk and single cell RNA-seq data from wild-type or mutant mice, as well as facial enhancer expression databases. Accomplishment of these studies will predict how genes are transcriptionally regulated in a temporospatial manner during facial development and discover sets of core transcription factors and super- enhancers controlling facial development. These transcriptional regulatory networks will be relevant to the genetic and molecular underpinnings of human orofacial clefting, and will provide clear testable predictions about transcription factor function and the consequences of aberrant expression. Performance and accomplishment of these Aims will also act as a major component of my career development plan, in which my goal is to obtain and independent tenure-track faculty position and serve as a mentor to the next generation of scientists. A major aspect of my career development plan is to build on my growing strength in bioinformatics by learning more advanced techniques in this specialty alongside new computational based approaches, such as machine learning. In this respect, my Aims and career development plan are aligned with a Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) of NIDCR in Supporting Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research Using Bioinformatic, Computational, and Data Science Approaches (NOT-DE-20-006) for which this application is targeted. I have recruited a mentorship team with specialties in craniofacial biology, bioinformatics, machine learning, and career development to help me achieve these goals. Project Narrative Human craniofacial development is a complex process and requires suites of genes to be switched on and off at appropriate times and spaces during formation of the embryo. There is now a wealth of data available in public databases concerning which genes are expressed when and where during mammalian facial development, including for the transcription factors which are the proteins that regulate these critical expression programs, but we have not yet begun to connect this information together to derive logical predictions about the critical networks responsible for craniofacial development. This proposal will address that gap using both computational and laboratory-based methods to derive and verify transcriptional regulatory networks relevant to the genetic and molecular underpinnings of normal facial development as well as how these are disrupted to cause defects such as human orofacial clefting.",Transcriptional Regulatory Networks of Craniofacial Development,10284443,K01DE030923,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cartilage', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Models', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Dental', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Ectoderm', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Face', 'FaceBase', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchyme', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Oral', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Study models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Validation', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'base', 'bone', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'critical period', 'design', 'differential expression', 'in silico', 'interest', 'medical specialties', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'next generation', 'orofacial cleft', 'programs', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tenure track', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K01,2021,130135
"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non-coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well-described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome-wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE’s utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 100,000 CREs and 375,000 variants, representing ~100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element’s regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 20 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity. In doing so, we will create a resource that will improve our ability to pinpoint regulatory elements in our genome, increase our understanding of how they function, and aid in our ability to link genetic variation to human health and disease.",Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation,10241056,UM1HG009435,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elements', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'trait']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",UM1,2021,1496338
"Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular Disease-associated genetic variants have been found to be enriched in regulatory genomic regions of gene expression. In order to gain detailed understanding of disease mechanisms, one central question is to systematically delineate how tissue-specific gene expression programs are regulated. Enhancers are a major family of regulatory elements with complex signatures and they are abundant in the human genome. Enhancer regulation of gene expression is highly tissue-specific, associated with combinatorial transcription factor binding, and involved with long-range three-dimensional chromatin interactions. It is therefore challenging to characterize the large-scale enhancer regulatory networks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a suite of probabilistic models and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict genome-wide enhancer regulatory networks in diverse panels of cellular contexts and the associated molecular mechanisms to establish long-range interactions, which will be leveraged to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. In Aim 1, novel integrative graphical models will be developed to predict long-range chromatin interactions linking tissue-specific enhancers to their distal target genes, along with combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns. In Aim 2, computational algorithms will be designed to interrogate how specific chromatin interactions are established, leading to mechanistic insights on chromatin formation. In Aim 3, statistical models will be developed to integrate enhancer-gene regulatory networks with genetics data to predict which non-coding variants may disrupt regulatory links and cause diseases, with improved statistical power and accuracy. This modeling framework will substantially expand the analytical ability on non-coding variants and human disease mechanisms. Computational predictions from the three aims will be experimentally tested in mouse models of breast cancer development. This project will lead to both innovative computational tools and systematic biological insights on long-range enhancer regulation and their functional roles in human diseases. The advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms will provide efficient big-data integration tools for epigenetics, gene regulation and human genetics. Comprehensive predictions from this project represent valuable platforms to delineate genetic variants and disease mechanisms. Novel mechanistic insights of diseases at the regulatory and molecular level will facilitate improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for human diseases.",Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular,10172932,R01GM131398,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Targeting', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor USF']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,325001
"Integrating epigenomics with DNA breathing dynamics for human non-coding disease variants ABSTRACT Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing of complex diseases have revealed a plethora of disease risk variants, most of which lie in noncoding regions of DNA without easily interpretable function. A main functional mechanism of noncoding variants is to alter chromatin accessibility to transcription factors (TFs), thereby influencing gene expression. Predicting the effects of noncoding variants on TF binding and gene expression on a large scale is thus important but remains challenging. Available computational tools for predicting regulatory variants largely rely on TF-binding motif models and/or local chromatin modification features. Here, we aim to develop a novel computational framework to address two major limitations of these methods. First, given that known disease causal noncoding variants often reside outside of TF binding motifs, how can we improve the prediction of TF binding variants outside of motifs? For this, we plan to integrate TF ChIP-seq data with features that are important for TF binding but have not been considered in previous methods, in particular the DNA breathing dynamics (AIM1). DNA breathing reflects local transient opening of the DNA double helix due to thermal fluctuations. We have shown that genetic variants can affect nearby (up to a few hundred base pairs) DNA breathing dynamics that affect TF binding. Using TF ChIP-seq data, we will train models that predict specific TF binding variants in or outside TF motifs, incorporating DNA breathing dynamics with other features such as DNA shapes and cooperative TF binding. Secondly, given that chromatin features only show modest (<2-fold) enrichment of genetic variants associated with complex diseases or traits, how can we improve the prediction of regulatory variants? For this, we will build a computation model, considering the allele-specific chromatin accessibility (ASCA; i.e., two alleles of a heterozygous individual show read imbalance in chromatin accessibility assays) as a functional readout of a regulatory variant (AIM2). We have shown that neuronal ASCA SNPs are highly enriched for those implicated by schizophrenia (SZ) GWAS. Using neuronal ASCA data, we will train models that predict variants with regulatory effects, taking advantage of our TF-specific classifiers (from AIM1). As a proof of concept, the models will be applied to a large SZ GWAS dataset to predict putative causal regulatory variants. We will validate the effects of the predicted top-ranking regulatory SZ variants on gene expression in a well-powered hiPSC sample by combining multiplex CRISPR-based SNP editing and single-cell RNA-seq analysis (AIM3). For SNPs showing the strongest regulatory effects, we will further use CRISPR editing to verify the SNP effect on gene expression and disease-relevant neuronal phenotypes. Accurately predicting TF-affecting noncoding variants will enable better understanding of the large number of noncoding variants implicated in complex disorders and help formulate testable biological hypotheses, ultimately facilitating the development of targeted therapeutics. NARRATIVE We will develop novel computational methods and a cost-effective functional validation approach to systematically infer the effect of disease-associated noncoding variants on transcription factor binding and gene expression. Identifying the functional noncoding variants that are associated with disease risk will help illuminate causal molecular mechanisms, facilitating the clinical translation of genetic findings into disease risk prediction and treatment.",Integrating epigenomics with DNA breathing dynamics for human non-coding disease variants,10115126,R01MH116281,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adenine', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Breathing', 'Cell Line', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Classification', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'causal variant', 'chromatin modification', 'clinical translation', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost effective', 'disorder risk', 'epigenomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'risk prediction', 'risk variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'support vector machine', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIMH,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2021,605699
"Nuclear Organization and Function PROJECT SUMMARY. Proper regulation of gene expression is essential for cell differentiation and homeostasis. Most of our understanding of the mechanisms that control the transcription process comes from studies of the one-dimensional genome i.e. the 10 nm chromatin fiber. However, the genome is folded in the three-dimensional (3D) nuclear space, and the relationship between this organization and gene expression is poorly understood. Using Drosophila as a model system, where it is feasible to obtain 250 bp resolution Hi-C data, we have found that the genome is folded into only one type of domain, which we call compartmental domains. These domains precisely correlate with the transcriptional state of their sequences. Compartmental domains are also found in other lower eukaryotes. Based on this, we propose that compartmental domains represent an evolutionarily conserved principle of genome 3D organization. Drosophila and lower eukaryotes either lack CTCF or this protein is unable to stop cohesin extrusion. However, CTCF can interfere with the progression of cohesin extrusion in vertebrates, which in turn affects other types of interactions in the genome. Here we suggest extending concepts learned from the analysis of 3D organization in Drosophila to mammals by proposing an ambitious and substantive multi-disciplinary approach combining genetics, epigenomics, computational biology, and differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) into disease-relevant tissues. The hypothesis underlying the proposed experiments is based on the idea that, rather than the prevalent view of large compartments containing smaller TADs, the mammalian genome is organized by conserved principles into relatively small compartmental domains. Cohesin extrusion operates on top of the compartmental domain scaffold and affects its organization. To test this novel hypothesis, we will deplete specific proteins present in complexes required for various aspects of the transcription process. We will also deplete protein complexes responsible for H3K27me3- and H3K9me3-dependent silencing. We will then use Micro-C XL to obtain very high-resolution interaction data and examine effects of protein depletion on the formation of self-interacting domains and in the interactions between these domains. These effects will be examined in the presence and absence of cohesin in order to understand the contribution of loop extrusion to enhancer-promoter interaction frequency. We will examine the predictability of 3D genome organization from one-dimensional epigenetic information using machine learning computational tools. We will study the logic of CTCF loop formation by analyzing the local chromatin environment around CTCF sites able or unable to form loops of different strengths using a new computational tool we have developed. Principles learned from these experiments will be tested by analyzing changes in 3D organization and their relationship to gene expression during the differentiation of hESCs into pancreatic cells. Results from this work will fill critical gaps in our understanding of the relationship between 3D chromatin organization and transcription, and its possible role in human disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will analyze the mechanisms by which the three-dimensional organization of the genetic material in the nucleus is established and maintained. This organization is critical for the regulation of gene expression, and the results will be important to understand how transcription is controlled during stem cell differentiation or during reprograming of somatic cells. This knowledge will be essential to understand the basic biology of the cell nucleus and the origin of human genetic disease or cancer and could help guide the use of stem cell therapy to treat human diseases.",Nuclear Organization and Function,10083368,R35GM139408,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Fiber', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Eukaryota', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Hi-C', 'Homeostasis', 'Human Genetics', 'Knowledge', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Nuclear', 'Pancreas', 'Proteins', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Site', 'Somatic Cell', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Process', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'base', 'cohesin', 'computerized tools', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mammalian genome', 'novel', 'promoter', 'protein complex', 'scaffold', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell therapy']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,431097
"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. A subset of these events will likely be informative or diagnostic of diseases states. Therefore, an important goal is to define informative interactions using cost-enabling, high accuracy, and robust genome-wide assays. To this end, ChIP-exo was developed to map the genomic binding locations of gene regulatory proteins at near-single base pair resolution. This assay will be applied, in high throughput, to determine the genome-wide positional organization of factors within protein-DNA complexes, like enhanceosomes. By broadly mapping the various classes of proteins that constitute much of the regulated epigenome, general rules about enhancer and repressor complex organization will be deduced. Aim 1 involves collecting genome-wide ChIP-exo data in human cell lines for a wide variety of protein-DNA complexes. Aim 2 will develop and implement computational approaches towards pattern recognition and data distillation in ChIP-exo datasets. The results are expected to provide structural insights into macromolecular protein complex assembly on a genomic scale, and in various cell types and conditions. Proteins that bind throughout the human genome control the genes that govern human health. Precise identification of the positional organization of these proteins within complexes will inform us as to the mechanics of their action, and mis-action when diseased.

"Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D This section has not changed since the submission of the parent U01 grant. Project Summary Most of the 1000s of sequencing experiments generated by ENCODE provide 1D readouts of the epigenetic landscape or transcriptional output of a 3D genome. New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies – in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET – have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression. Mechanistic predictions will be experimentally validated in their native cell-type specific chromatin context using state-of-the-art genome editing, exploiting computational and experimental CRISPR/Cas tools developed by our team. This section has not changed since the submission of the parent U01 grant. Project Narrative This project develops advanced computational methods for integrating information on the 3D structure of the human genome with large-scale genomics data sets generated by the ENCODE project to gain insight into cell-type specific chromatin state and gene regulation.

"Hit-and-Run transcription: The impact of transient interactions in dynamic gene regulatory networks that mediate rapid nutrient signaling Project Summary: This grant exploits TIME - the 4th and largely unexplored dimension of transcription - to capture transient interactions in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that are important, but missed, in vivo. This is because genome- scale methods to capture transcription factor (TF) target interactions favor stable binding, and reporter gene studies which detect transient TF-target interactions in seconds, miss global responses needed for GRN models. We aim to fill the time-gap in our collective knowledge of dynamic GRNs by experimentally capturing transient TF-target interactions globally using a cell-based temporal TF perturbation assay (Aims 1 & 2), and evaluate their importance in forecasting gene expression at future time-points (Aim 3), a main goal of systems biology. We model temporal GRNs controlling nitrogen (N)-signaling in plants, but our approaches are broadly applicable. We exploit a cell-based assay for temporal TF perturbation, TARGET, which captures transient TF-target interactions genome-wide; i) by TF-mediated gene regulation even in the absence of detectable TF-binding, ii) within minutes of controlled TF nuclear entry, and iii) identifies highly transient TF-binding leading to sustained transcription by affinity-capture of de novo mRNAs. We discovered that i) a single TF can stably or transiently bind to, and induce or repress, distinct sets of targets depending on their cis-context, ii) that transient TF-targets captured only in cells control early N-responses in planta, for two master TFs in our GRNs (bZIP1 & NLP7). This genome-wide data supports a Hit-and-Run transcription model, where a TF Hit can initiate a stable transcriptional complex, including recruitment of TF partners, enabling transcription to continue after the initiating TF is no longer bound, the Run. This could allow a small number of TF molecules to rapidly affect a large number of target genes by acting catalytically. Our studies have been cited and influenced thinking of transient transcription mechanisms across yeast, stems cells, and were invoked to explain the new discovery of transient binding of Zelda/Bicoid to a reporter gene in Drosophila. Herein, we deploy experimental and computational innovations to test the pervasiveness and in vivo significance of a conceptual innovation - transient Hit-and- Run interactions in GRNs. Our experimental innovations include; i) Assays for Hit-and-Run activity across all 70 TF families in Arabidopsis, using a higher throughput version of the cell-based TARGET assay we recently published, ii) new methods to capture TF-target interactions using time-series biotin-ChIP and DamID, which leaves DNA methylation marks on transient TF-target interactions, supported by preliminary data (Aims 1 & 2). Our computational innovations include: i) ConnectTF, a platform to integrate TF-DNA binding and RNA-seq data and identify candidate Hit-and-Run TFs, and approaches to assess the in planta relevance of transient TF- target interactions in GRNs, such as ii) our newly published Network Walking method, and iii) OutPredict, a new time-based method to forecast gene expression at future time-points (Aim 3).

"RegulomeDB: A Resource for the Human Regulome PROJECT SUMMARY The Human RegulomeDB project provides an essential resource that facilitates medical research and exploratory investigations of gene regulation. The majority of sequence variation identified in genome sequencing projects and disease association studies (GWAS) lie within the 98% of the human genome that is non-exomic. RegulomeDB is a unique web accessible resource that provides integrated knowledge of the wealth of existing information concerning regulatory elements that lie within non-exomic regions. The unique feature of this resource is its ability to comprehensively annotate, integrate and display the experimentally defined functional and biochemical regulatory elements of the human genome. Information generated from individual laboratories and consortia concerning potential regulatory regions such as that affecting gene expression, transcription factor binding, chromatin modification and DNA methylation will be collected from the literature, and integrated into a common database and displayed at nucleotide resolution. The information can be readily accessed via a web accessible interface and related to sequence variations identified from large scale projects (e.g. db SNPs, 1000 genome project, GWAS studies). Researchers will be able to compare variants identified from personal genomes and large scale sequencing projects as well as GWAS studies to the wealth of information in RegulomeDB, and thereby rapidly gain knowledge of non-exomic information. Given the wealth of DNA sequencing project that are emerging, we expect this unique resource to have wide impact in the biomedical community. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH, PROJECT NARRATIVE The regulation of gene expression controls the determination of cell types, and aberrant gene expression can cause diseases such as cancer. RegulomeDB will enable researchers, clinicians, and sophisticated computer programs to relate DNA variants that lie in previously poorly understood regions of the human genome to possible functions thereby helping us understand the genetic basis of human variation and disease.",RegulomeDB: A Resource for the Human Regulome,10245271,U24HG009293,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Literature', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Quality Control', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cell determination', 'cell type', 'chromatin modification', 'computer program', 'data integration', 'data wrangling', 'de novo mutation', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genome annotation', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'meetings', 'outreach', 'random forest', 'social media', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'web platform', 'web site', 'web-accessible', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U24,2021,674483
"Systematic Identification of Core Regulatory Circuitry from ENCODE Data While much progress has been made generating high quality chromatin state and accessibility data from the ENCODE and Roadmap consortia, accurately identifying cell-type specific enhancers from these data remains a significant challenge. We have recently developed a computational approach (gkmSVM) to predict regulatory elements from DNA sequence, and we have shown that when gkmSVM is trained on DHS data from each of the human and mouse ENCODE and Roadmap cells and tissues, it can predict both cell specific enhancer activity and the impact of regulatory variants (deltaSVM) with greater precision than alternative approaches. The gkmSVM model encapsulates a set of cell-type specific weights describing the regulatory binding site vocabulary controlling chromatin accessibility in each cell type. A striking observation is that the significant gkmSVM weights are generally identifiable with a small (~20) set of TF binding sites which vary by cell-type, consistent with the hypothesis that cell-type specific expression programs are controlled by a small set of core factors tightly coupled in mutually interacting regulatory circuits. Perturbations of these core regulators enable transitions between stable differentiated cell-type states of this genetic circuit. Here, we will use gkmSVM to systematically identify the core regulatory circuitry in all existing ENCODE and Roadmap human and mouse cell lines and tissues, and produce DNA sequence based genomic regulatory maps and fine-scale predictions of core regulator binding sites within predicted regulatory regions. We will generate binding site models for core regulators in each cell type, assess the accuracy of our predictions through direct experimental validation. The value of this map critically depends on its accuracy, so we demonstrate that gkmSVM predictions consistently outperform alternative methods in massively parallel enhancer reporter and luciferase validation assays, in blind community assessments of regulatory element predictions (CAGI), and in predicting validated causal disease associated variants. In contrast, we show that methods using PWM descriptions of TF binding sites are significantly less accurate. We will produce base-pair resolution predictions of the cell specific TF binding sites (TFBS) within broader regulatory regions detected by multiple ENCODE epigenomic Mapping datasets, and to test these TFBS predictions in collaboration with Functional Characterization Centers (FCC). Our regulatory maps will help design and inform focused experiments probing regulatory mechanisms, and aid in the interpretation of disease associated non-coding variants. We propose to develop computational tools to systematically identify the core TF regulators using DNA sequence based machine learning (ML) in all existing ENCODE and Roadmap human and mouse cell lines and tissues, and to produce base-pair resolution predictions of the cell specific TF binding sites (TFBS) within broader regulatory regions detected by multiple ENCODE epigenomic Mapping datasets, and to test these TFBS predictions in collaboration with Functional Characterization Centers (FCC).",Systematic Identification of Core Regulatory Circuitry from ENCODE Data,10238262,U01HG009380,"['Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Encapsulated', 'Enhancers', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mouse Cell Line', 'Mus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'blind', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'programs']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,572256
"From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms The current forward genetics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified ~300 distinct loci regulating blood pressure (BP), primarily implicating sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, for precision medicine of hypertension (HTN), a major challenge for public health, mechanistic identification of the genomic components altering the expression of BP genes is required. To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights. The major hypothesis explaining the results of blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific BP genes. In this second renewal of the FEHGAS consortium, we propose new computational and experimental approaches to identify the TFs, CREs, and target genes, active in four blood pressure target tissues, so that the effects of causal BP affecting genetic variation can be tested, within identified BP loci and genome-wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding how BP variation leads to primary hypertension and hypertensive target organ damage, a major public health challenge.","From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms",10101662,R01HL086694,"['ATAC-seq', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Essential Hypertension', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Organ', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'base', 'biobank', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'epigenomics', 'forward genetics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic approach', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'receptor', 'reverse genetics', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,564082
"Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq. PROJECT ABSTRACT Deciphering how complex programs of gene expression and regulation contribute to human disease is one of the major challenges facing the field of genomics. Over the past decade, a wealth of new high-throughput genomics tools have revolutionized how we identify active genomic regions and appear poised to make great strides in understanding the mechanisms of disease. Yet the application of most of these technologies has been limited to established cell lines. Currently, approaches being developed to comprehensively map functional elements across the genome involve combining data from several different genome-wide experimental assays, making them expensive and impractical to use in clinical isolates of limited quantity or even to analyze new cell lines. Compounding these technical difficulties, gene expression is a complex and highly tissue dependent biological process, and many important applications will require the direct interrogation of clinical isolates or other similarly limited sources of sample. Thus, efficient new tools that map the repertoire of functional elements across the genome are likely to transform the biomedical and clinical sciences.  We propose to develop Chromatin Run-On and Sequencing (ChRO-seq) and a suite of computational tools for mapping transcription directly in limited tissue samples. Our approach uses a single genome-wide molecular assay to efficiently identify the location of promoters and enhancers, transcription factor binding sites, gene and lincRNA boundaries, transcription levels, and impute certain histone modifications. Preliminary ChRO-seq data reveals patterns of transcription that are virtually identical to those using Precision Run on and Sequencing in cultured cells, but can easily be applied in solid tissue samples. We applied our preliminary ChRO-seq technology to several primary tumors, revealing new insights into how transcriptional regulation underlies cancer development and progression, and providing a key proof-of-concept motivating further technology development. We anticipate that ChRO-seq and the computational methods proposed will enable the efficient discovery of functional elements in virtually any cell sample. In addition, ChRO-seq has the unique advantage that it can be applied in limited tissue samples and clinical isolates even after the degradation of mRNA. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a suite of molecular and computational technologies that allow researchers to directly measure transcriptional regulation of genes, enhancers, and lincRNAs in limited clinical isolates. These technologies are anticipated to have a major impact on the biomedical sciences, enabling the genome-wide interrogation of transcription during virtually any disease process for the first time.",Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq.,10085663,R01HG009309,"['Archives', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase I', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'computational suite', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'detection platform', 'established cell line', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic tools', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'promoter', 'scale up', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'virtual']",NHGRI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,387500
"Integrated multi-omics analyses of early mammalian craniofacial development Abstract Craniofacial abnormalities are some of the most commonly occurring human birth defects worldwide, with up to 200,000 children born every year with some type of craniofacial defect. These defects can occur as part of complex syndromes that involve multiple tissues and organs. The syndromic forms of these disorders have been successfully linked to nearly 500 genes including TWIST1 for craniosynostosis and IRF6 for orofacial clefting. However more frequently no other part of the body is directly involved (50% of craniosynostoses, 70% of orofacial clefts). Genome wide association studies indicate heritability for such defects, however the vast majority of associations fall outside of genes suggesting defective gene regulation is a major contributor to incidence of such defects. Gene regulatory elements can be located throughout the genome and typically have tissue-specific activity, making them difficult to identify and predict what gene they control. The overall objective of this application is to integrate epigenomic and transcriptomic data sets from early human and mouse craniofacial development from our lab as well as FaceBase to comprehensively predict regulatory element-gene interactions. Our hypothesis posits that conserved regulatory networks between human and mouse are enriched for disease relevant biology. In Aim 1 we propose to systematically identify chromatin states in human from 4.5 to 8 weeks of gestation and in mouse from embryonic days 9.5 to 15.5. In Aim 2 we propose to identify genes that are coordinately regulated in both species across these developmental windows. Finally, in Aim 3 we propose to integrate these two disparate network types to identify regulatory element-gene pairings. We will experimentally validate predicted interactions in a culture model of cranial neural crest cells using proximity-ligation coupled with immunoprecipitation. Our proposed studies will generate the most comprehensive epigenomic and transcriptomic networks in a developing human tissue and for the first time identify the conserved regulatory architecture for building the mammalian orofacial complex. Defects in embryonic patterning resulting in clefts of orofacial tissue are common birth defects affecting more than 1 in 1000 live births. The genetic causes of these defects have been difficult to determine, but all current evidence suggests defective gene regulation during embryonic development underlies these birth defects. This project seeks to identify regulatory networks that control gene expression during craniofacial development and are conserved between human and mouse.",Integrated multi-omics analyses of early mammalian craniofacial development,10083207,R03DE028588,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Body part', 'Cephalic', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Coupled', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Exons', 'Face', 'FaceBase', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Neural Crest Cell', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Syndrome', 'TWIST1 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computational pipelines', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'differential expression', 'embryo tissue', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'falls', 'gene interaction', 'genetic information', 'genome wide association study', 'human tissue', 'multiple omics', 'orofacial', 'orofacial cleft', 'programs', 'promoter', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R03,2021,164000
"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer. Such interactions occur between distally located regulatory sequence elements and genes hundreds of kilobases away. Currently our understanding of long-range gene regulation is limited to a few cell types and model organisms. Computational methods to identify regulatory elements and systematically link them to target genes in diverse cell types and mammalian species can significantly improve our understanding of the impact of long-range gene regulation in human diseases, help interpret regulatory variation in non-coding parts of the genome and assist in the development of better biomarkers.",Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation,10208923,R01HG010045,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'comparative', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genomic locus', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'markov model', 'multi-task learning', 'multiple datasets', 'multitask', 'novel', 'promoter', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,332892
"Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract In the United States, the joint disease osteoarthritis (OA) debilitates over one-third of people over sixty-five years old and causes hundreds of thousands of knee replacements annually. Despite its high prevalence, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate knee formation and OA risk and how one inherits risk at specific joints (e.g., knee versus hip). Recent GWAS have identified at least seventeen loci that significantly associate with knee OA risk. However, the casual variants for these loci have not been identified because their association signals span large genomic intervals harboring uninvestigated non-coding regulatory regions. Of these, common variants in the Growth Differentiation Factor Five gene (GDF5), a critical regulator of joint development, reproducibly associate with knee OA risk in human populations. GDF5 OA variants reside on a high frequency 130 kb haplotype possessing numerous mutations that each may be causal for OA risk, but interestingly, no protein coding mutations have been uncovered that explain the associations. In a complementary study, we discovered ten GDF5 regulatory elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers) spanning this interval and revealed that they function with tremendous joint specificity (e.g., knee vs. hip). These enhancers were initially tested at incipient stages of GDF5 expression in mouse embryos, but we also know that GDF5 contributes to the differentiation of knee structures (ligaments, tendons, menisci, articular surfaces) well after this stage of development. Our research will bring together knee OA risk variants in patient populations and our knowledge of how GDF5 is controlled at the DNA level. We first aim to assess the functional contributions of joint-specific GDF5 enhancers to pre-natal knee development and adult joint homeostasis using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to excise these elements in vitro in human cells and in vivo in the mouse. Strikingly, our pilot analyses also revealed that a subset of these GDF5 enhancers possesses common and rare human variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with the highest associated OA variants in the interval. Our second aim is to further explore the association between genetic variants in the locus and OA knee shape using data acquired from the complete Osteoarthritis Initiative MR database on adult knees. Our preliminary data reveal that several variants associated with OA knee shape reside in several functional enhancers that control expression of GDF5 in the knee. Finally, our third aim is to functionally test these human regulatory variants for their impact on enhancer activity, knee formation, and OA risk by using transfection studies and CRISPR-Cas9 in human cartilage cells and in the mouse model. Completion of these studies will reveal functional variants in GDF5 that underlie its role in knee shape and OA risk. Project Narrative The Growth Differentiation Factor Five (GDF5) gene is the most reproducibly detected gene region in candidate and genome-wide association studies focusing on knee osteoarthritis risk. The proposed research focuses on (1) assessing the specific functions of key GDF5 regulatory sequences in knee development and cartilage maintenance in mice and humans, (2) the association of genetic variants in GDF5 locus with osteoarthritis knee shape, and (3) the impacts that human GDF5 risk mutations have on chondrocyte and joint biology.",Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis,10179320,R01AR070139,"['5 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cartilage', 'Cells', 'Chondrocytes', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Differentiation and Growth', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Haplotypes', 'High Prevalence', 'Hip region structure', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Ligaments', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Transfection', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Veins', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'cartilage cell', 'causal variant', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic locus', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prenatal', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'spatiotemporal', 'whole genome']",NIAMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,612601

We will then apply these analytical methods to the psychENCODE data corpus, integrating these data with GTEx, ENCODE, and CommonMind data, annotating GWAS SNPs associated with psych disease, prioritizing the discovered regulatory elements for validation, and visualizing all psychENCODE data in an integrated fashion. We will then validate these predicted regulatory elements using large-scale genomic assays in neuroblastoma cells, iPSC cells, and neuronal precursor cells differentiated into neuronal lineages, and using a microfluidics platform capable of culturing neuronal cells and neuronal organoids. The results from these studies will further our understanding of the genetic regulatory basis for neuronal function in both normal and neuropsychiatric disease states. The data generated by the psychENCODE Consortium are a pre-eminent, centralized resource for studying the human brain.

"Genetic regulation of atrial gene expression in development and disease SUMMARY  Precise regulation of atrial gene expression is crucial to maintain atrial homeostasis, and disorders or gene mutations that impact atrial gene expression can cause atrial fibrillation (AF), a serious arrhythmia that affects an estimated 33 million people worldwide. However, there remain many gaps in our understanding of atrial gene regulation, including the mechanisms that underlie chamber-selective gene expression. Human genetic studies have shown that sequence variants near the cardiac transcription factor gene TBX5 are associated with greater AF risk, and mice with Tbx5 deficiency develop AF. Although recent work has identified some TBX5-regulated genes that contribute to AF susceptibility, the atrial TBX5-centered transcriptional network is incompletely explored. Elucidation of this network and its sensitivity to TBX5 dose would reveal nodal points in AF pathogenesis and may suggest new approaches to prevent or treat AF. The overarching goal of this re- search proposal is to elucidate the atrial gene regulatory network and how it is perturbed in AF. The proposal buillds on novel reagents and techniques developed in the Pu lab to interrogate transcriptional mechanisms in vivo, including highly sensitive and reproducible cardiac transcription factor ChIP-seq through in vivo biotinyla- tion (bioChIP-seq), massively parallel in vivo measurement of cis-regulatory element (CRE) activity (AAV- MPRA assay), and mosaic gene inactivation strategies to hone in direct, cell autonomous effects of gene inac- tivation. In Aim 1, we use bioChIP-seq and AAV-MPRA to define atrial CREs and to dissect the sequence fea- tures required for their chamber selective activity. In Aim 2, we determine the effect of TBX5 deficiency on the occupancy of other TFs and p300, the activity of CREs, and the expression of atrial genes. We use these data to define the TBX5-centered atrial gene regulatory network, and to determine how this network is perturbed by TBX5 haploinsufficiency or knockout. In Aim 3, we test the hypothesis, suggested by our preliminary data, that TBX5 regulates atrial genes through functional and physical interaction with TEAD1. Successful completion of this proposal will lead to new insights into atrial gene regulation and its perturbation in AF. NARRATIVE  The heart's upper chambers, the atria, and its lower chambers, the ventricles, contain fundamentally dis- tinct types of muscle cells, and are affected by different types of disease. One common and severe disease specific to the atria is atrial fibrillation, which occurs in over 9% of older individuals. This proposal will investi- gate the mechanisms that maintain atrial muscle cell gene expression, and perturbation of these mechanisms that cause atrial fibrillation, resulting in new insights into the causes of atrial diseases such as atrial fibrillation.",Genetic regulation of atrial gene expression in development and disease,10138240,R01HL156503,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Age-Years', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotinylation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cells', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Data', 'Dependovirus', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Dose', 'EP300 gene', 'Enhancers', 'Etiology', 'GATA4 gene', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Transduction Agent', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Homeostasis', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Metabolic stress', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Mus', 'Muscle Cells', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Nodal', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Precipitation', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'biochip', 'combinatorial', 'dosage', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic locus', 'heart function', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'muscle enhancer factor-2A', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'organ growth', 'prevent', 'programs', 'stem', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NHLBI,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,607338
"Beyond GWAS: High Throughput Functional Genomics & Epigenome Editing to Elucidate the Effects of Genetic Associations for Schizophrenia Project Summary Schizophrenia (SCZ) genomics has achieved unprecedented advances. A decade ago, there was perhaps one solid finding, and there are now ~270 loci that meet consensus criteria for significance and replication. As observed for other complex psychiatric disorders, the identified regions are overwhelmingly noncoding, strongly suggesting that genetic variation in gene regulatory elements is a major mechanistic contributor. Further investigation of those regulatory mechanisms is precluded by a fundamental gap in the ability to identify, characterize, and quantify brain-relevant regulatory elements, and limited understanding of how genetic variation within those elements influences their function. To address this knowledge gap, this project will comprehensively identify, characterize, quantify, and validate noncoding functional noncoding regulatory elements and variants in neuronal cells. The central hypothesis of the proposal is that noncoding variation contributes to psychiatric disorders by directly altering the function of regulatory elements in the brain. The motivation for the proposed study is that identifying regulatory mechanisms of psychiatric disorders has the potential to translate into improved diagnosis and treatment. Powered by a team with strong interdisciplinary expertise in psychiatric disorders, functional genomics, technology development, and statistical genetics, this hypothesis will be tested by completing three specific aims: 1) Comprehensive integration of diverse data types to generate hypotheses that “connect” psychiatric genetic results to specific genes; 2) perform high-throughput CRISPR epigenome editing screens to test Aim 1 hypotheses in a natural biological context; 3) Develop mechanistic understanding and validate functional noncoding SCZ risk variants using TF binding assays and iPS-derived neurons from SCZ cases with high genetic risk scores. Our approach is innovative because it uses a highly complementary and diverse set of experimental approaches to drive targeted genetic and functional investigation into regulatory mechanisms relevant for SCZ. In doing so, the proposed research provides a much-needed path forward to understand how noncoding variation contributes to complex human phenotypes. Project Narrative / Relevance Genetic research for psychiatric disorders has achieved remarkable advances in narrowing down regions of the genome that increase risk. However, the exact mechanism for why certain individuals are at higher risk than others remains unknown. The goal of this grant is to identify, characterize, and validate functional noncoding mutations that contribute to schizophrenia. Understanding how specific DNA variants directly contribute to psychiatric disorders will be critical for developing improved diagnostics and treatment therapies.",Beyond GWAS: High Throughput Functional Genomics & Epigenome Editing to Elucidate the Effects of Genetic Associations for Schizophrenia,10115982,R01MH125236,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Awareness', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Motivation', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organoids', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Proteomics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Solid', 'Sweden', 'Synapses', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translating', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain volume', 'cell type', 'disorder risk', 'diverse data', 'epigenome', 'epigenome editing', 'excitatory neuron', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mind control', 'mouse model', 'nerve stem cell', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychogenetics', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'technology development', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1653935
"Interpreting function of non-coding sequences with synthetic biology and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most disease-associated variants lie in non-coding regions of the genome and exert their influence through effects on gene expression. However, we lack a predictive framework to interpret such non-coding variants, limiting how genomic data is used in precision medicine. We may be able to interpret non-coding variants with new machine learning algorithms, but so far the practical applications of machine learning in functional genomics have been limited because of two major challenges. First, the size and diversity of training data sets in functional genomics are orders of magnitude smaller than in applications where machine learning has been successful, such as image recognition and product recommendation. A second challenge is that if training data are not collected in an appropriate in vitro cellular model, then the resulting machine learning models may not generalize to relevant in vivo cell types. To improve the application of machine learning to non-coding variants, I propose to address both the limited size of training data sets and the efficacy of cell culture models. A core principle of machine learning is that model performance improves with more data. In Aim 1, I propose to increase the size and diversity of training data by performing iterative cycles of machine learning and experimental validation with Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs). The key aspect of my approach is to algorithmically design each successive MPRA library to contain sequences that are most likely to improve the next round of modeling. I recently trained my first model on data that I collected from MPRA experiments of cis-regulatory sequences that function in mammalian photoreceptors. To avoid any issues with cell lines, I performed these experiments in ex vivo developing retinas, which retain the appropriate tissue architecture. However, unlike photoreceptors, most cell types are not experimentally tractable in their native physiological context. Thus, it will be important to determine how well in vitro cell lines recapitulate in vivo cis-regulation. In Aim 2, I propose to determine whether a tractable cell culture model can recapitulate results from ex vivo retinas. I will use existing MPRA data from ex vivo retinas as a standard to compare against data collected in cell lines engineered to express combinations of photoreceptor transcription factors. I aim to address whether engineering tractable cell lines to express tissue-specific transcription factors might be a general approach for collecting data to train machine learning models that generalize to in vivo systems. Successful completion of these aims will produce a general approach to increase the size and diversity of functional genomic training data, and may result in a general method for producing experimentally tractable systems for machine learning applications, ultimately helping us better apply genomic data to precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many genetic variants that cause disease do not affect the structure of genes, but instead affect short DNA sequences that control when, where, or how much a gene is produced. Every individual human contains thousands of genetic variants in these control regions, but only a small number of these variants influence gene production. I propose a combined experimental and computational framework to predict which variants affect gene production and which variants are harmless.",Interpreting function of non-coding sequences with synthetic biology and machine learning,10177882,F31HG011431,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Architecture', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Performance', 'Photoreceptors', 'Physiological', 'Production', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Retina', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'cell type', 'cellular engineering', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'practical application', 'precision medicine', 'synthetic biology', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,31970
"Integrative approaches to identification and interpretation of genes underlying psychiatric disorders Psychiatric disorders contribute substantially to the disease burden in the United States and worldwide. There is strong evidence for a genetic contribution to many psychiatric illnesses. In recent years, with the advancement of high throughput genomic technologies and the availability of large samples, remarkable success has been made in risk gene discovery for major psychiatric disorders [e.g., schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD)] through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, due to the high complexity of the human genome, few causal genes or variants have been identified within GWAS risk loci, thus, to date, limiting the potential of translating these genetic findings into biological mechanisms. There is now a great need to pinpoint causal genes/variants at the known GWAS risk loci and to understand their causal mechanisms, as well as to discover novel genes from novel risk loci. There is also growing evidence that risk variants from GWAS tend to be located in regulatory DNA regions in disease-relevant tissues or cell types, suggesting that risk variants may act through regulation of gene expression. Studies leveraging diverse functional genomic resources may benefit psychiatric risk gene discovery and result in better prediction of their biological relevance. This proposal aims to employ highly integrative approaches to identify causal genes and regulatory noncoding variants underlying SCZ, BD, and MDD. Our specific aims are: 1) Integrate GWAS with brain methylome for risk gene discovery, by leveraging a dense high-resolution reference panel of DNAm from whole genome bisulfite sequencing of DNA from three different brain regions (frontal cortex, hippocampus, and caudate) and an enlarged array-based reference panel; 2) Apply a deep learning approach to predicting disease-relevant regulatory variants, by employing features from disease-relevant gene regulatory networks and functional genomic annotations within brain tissues and neural cell types; and 3) Map prioritized genes and variants to specific brain cell types and brain function. We have assembled an outstanding multidisciplinary team with expertise in psychiatric genetics, bioinformatics, machine learning, and neuroimaging. Our goal is to apply multidisciplinary and cutting-edge analytical strategies to help address the challenges arising in the post-GWAS era. The identification and characterization of risk genes and noncoding regulatory variants would help improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie psychiatric illnesses, moving us closer to designing effective prevention and treatment for these disorders.

"Comprehensive mapping of multimodal chromatin state in single cells PROJECT SUMMARY Many non-Mendelian (polygenic) human genetic diseases involve multiple causal loci in noncoding regions of the genome, implicating mutations in regulatory elements rather than protein-coding genes as the cause of these diseases. Deciphering the etiology of these human genetic diseases requires an understanding of how genes are regulated during development and homeostasis to produce functional cell states. This regulation is encoded both through epigenetic chromatin state, and genetically encoded in the DNA sequence of regulatory elements such as enhancers, promoters, silencers, and insulators. However, these regulatory elements and their activity states in human cells are not resolvable with current technologies. As aberrant gene regulation likely underlies many human diseases, understanding (1) the function of regulatory DNA elements and (2) their activity dynamics during healthy human development are essential. To address these two problems, I propose to: (i) develop new experimental methods to profile multimodal chromatin state in single cells; (ii) identify alterations in regulatory element activation states that guide cell fate choice during human hematopoiesis; (iii) identify the DNA sequence features important for regulatory element function; (iv) build community tools and resources for the analysis of single-cell chromatin data. Together these aims will provide methods and resources for the interrogation of the human functional genome, and the identification of regulatory state dynamics that generate human cell types. To succeed in achieving these aims, I will pursue additional training supported by co-mentors Dr. Rahul Satija (single-cell biology), Dr. Vijay Sankaran (hematopoiesis), Dr. Danny Reinberg (gene regulation), and Dr. David Knowles (machine learning). I have developed a 5-year career development plan that integrates scientific training in hematopoiesis and gene regulation, practical training and mentorship in deep learning, extensive leadership training through courses and mentorship, and seminars and workshops on academic writing. My team of scientific mentors will provide further guidance and mentorship in academic job searches. The New York Genome Center is an ideal environment for research and further career development, providing the cutting-edge research facilities and opportunities for further career development in a rich interdisciplinary environment. Completion of the proposed research program and career development plan will launch my independent scientific career as a leader in the field of single-cell epigenomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Information in the human genome encodes a multitude of functional cell states. How this information is decoded to produce these states, and how aberrant encodings produce aberrant states, is not well known.

"A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT  The incidence of diagnosed psychiatric disorders has been increasing for decades, leaving millions of afflicted individuals. Despite the high heritability, their underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Most risk loci are located in noncoding genomic elements without direct effects on protein products. Comprehensive functional annotation and variant impact quantification are essential to provide new molecular insights and discover therapeutic targets.  Recent advances in novel sequencing technologies and community efforts to share genomic data provide unprecedented opportunities to understand how genetic variants contribute to psychiatric diseases. This application describes the development of integrative strategies and machine learning methods to combine novel assays (such as STARR-seq) with population-scale genomic profiles to elucidate the genetic regulatory grammar in the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and to prioritize genetic variants in psychiatric disorders. Specifically, we will (1) dissect the cis- regulatory landscape of the PFC using population-scale epigenetics data, (2) construct multi- model gene regulatory networks by linking distal cis-regulatory elements to genes using chromatin co-variability analyses, (3) integrate genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional data to identify key transcription factors and variants that contribute to psychiatric disorders. Distinct from existing efforts focusing on one genome, this proposed work presents a truly novel big-data approach for both modeling gene regulation and investigating disease-risk factors by incorporating heterogeneous multi-omics profiles from hundreds of individuals. The resultant comprehensive list of cis-regulatory elements will expand the number of known functional regions in the human brain by at least an order. We will release our methods and resources in the form of web services, distributed open-source software, and annotation databases, which will also benefit other investigators exploring the genetic underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders.  In addition to its scientific content, this application proposes a comprehensive training program for preparing an independent investigator in computational genomics and neurogenetics. This training will take place at Yale University (in the Dept. of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry) under the mentorship of Prof. Mark Gerstein (functional genomics), Prof. Nenad Sestan (neurogenetics), and Prof. Hongyu Zhao (statistical genetics and machine learning). A committee of experienced psychiatric disease experts and data scientists will also provide advice on both scientific research and career development. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to discover cis- regulatory elements in the noncoding genome by incorporating novel functional characterization technologies (such as STARR-seq) with genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data from psychiatric patients. In contrast to existing methods that rely on a single genome, this work assumes a dynamic regulatory program in each individual and explores the regulatory heterogeneity across hundreds of epigenomes, thereby significantly expanding our current knowledge of the noncoding genome and facilitating functional interpretation of genetic variants. Furthermore, it will also generate publicly available annotation resources and software packages for the scientific community, thereby significantly accelerating the pace of novel therapeutic target discovery for treating psychiatric disorders.",A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders,10219797,K01MH123896,"['Affect', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Entropy', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scoring Method', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'genomic profiles', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neurogenetics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel sequencing technology', 'open source', 'programs', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'web services']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,K01,2021,111394
"Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm Our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms for orofacial clefting (OFC) is limited by the fact that less than half of the heritable risk for this disorder has been assigned to specific genes. Towards identifying pathological sequence variants among the many irrelevant ones detected in exomes and whole genomes of patients with this disorder, an understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern the development of relevant tissues, including the oral periderm, is essential. We propose a systems biology approach to analyzing the periderm GRN. Using this approach in the past enabled us to identify three novel OFC risk genes. We will utilize two model organisms, zebrafish and mouse, because the periderm differentiation GRN appears to be highly conserved. In zebrafish, the periderm differentiates very early in embryogenesis, greatly facilitating the execution and interpretation of genetic perturbation analyses. Mouse, on the other hand, has the advantage that its craniofacial anatomy is more similar to that of humans. In Aim 1, we will determine the zebrafish periderm differentiation GRN using a state-of-the-art network inference algorithm, NetProphet 2. This tool carries out both a coexpression analysis and a differential expression analysis. Input data sets will include RNA-seq expression profiles we will generate from loss-of-function (LOF) embryos for 4 key transcription factors (TF) known to participate in this GRN. We will also identify the direct gene linkages of these key TFs in the periderm GRN. Finally, we will test a novel candidate member of the periderm GRN, Tead, by carrying out LOF tests in zebrafish, thereby exploiting the strength of this model system. In Aim 2 we will deduce the murine oral periderm differentiation GRN, also using the NetProphet algorithm. Input datasets will include expression profiles of periderm isolated from the palate shelves of wild-type mouse embryos, and from heterozygous mutants of three key TFs: Irf6, Grhl3 and Tfap2a. For each of the mutant genotypes there is evidence of abnormal periderm differentiation. We will also identify murine periderm enhancer candidates by sorting GFP-positive and -negative cells from Krt17-gfp transgenic embryos, performing ATAC-seq on both populations, and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq on cells from palate shelves and the nasal cavity. As in Aim 1, we will also identify the direct gene linkages of the key TFs. We will train a machine learning algorithm on palate periderm enhancers, and use the resulting scoring function to prioritize OFC-associated SNPs near genes that are expressed in periderm for those that are likely to directly affect risk for OFC. Finally, we will perform allele- specific reporter assays on the top candidate SNPs from each of three loci. The expected outcome is a deeper understanding of the specific TFs and cis-regulatory elements that control differentiation of the periderm. This will have a broad impact because it will enable human geneticists to prioritize candidate risk variants that emerge from whole-exome and -genome sequencing analyses of OFC. Orofacial is a common disease with a major impact on the affected individual, their family and society. Here, we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm, an embryonic tissue that is critical for development of the palate. Our new knowledge will identify candidate genes and help identify pathogenic variants located in regulatory elements which will improve risk assessment and provide new targets for rational therapies.",Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm,10058264,R01DE023575,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'CDH1 gene', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryo Loss', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Epidermis', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Mammalian Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nasal cavity', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Palate', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Periderm', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Domains', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structural Congenital Anomalies', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'craniofacial', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'embryo tissue', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'loss of function', 'loss of function mutation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'model building', 'mutant', 'network models', 'novel', 'oral cavity epithelium', 'orofacial', 'orofacial cleft', 'paralogous gene', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,560204
"High-throughput computational modeling to assess the role of 3D genome folding in human congenital anomalies PROJECT SUMMARY Congenital heart defects (CHD) occur in nearly one percent of live births each year and are the leading cause of defect-associated infant mortality. The majority of genetic studies in CHD have focused on variation within the protein-coding exome; however, most disease-risk loci fall in noncoding regions, and it is presumed that some of these represent important regulators of gene expression such as cis-acting enhancers and insulators. In spite of these studies, less than half of the heritability of CHD has been explained via genome-wide associations or burden testing of protein-coding genes and putative regulatory elements. In this proposal, we hypothesize that genetic variants that alter 3D genome folding contribute to the etiology of CHD by disrupting the contacts of key cis-regulatory mechanisms in development. One type of chromatin structure that could be affected is the Topologically Associating Domain (TAD), which refers to a level of chromatin organization characterized by higher contact frequency within the domain relative to loci outside of that domain. It has been shown that while unaffected controls show a clear depletion of SVs at TAD boundary regions across the genome, individuals diagnosed with Developmental Delay (DD) and autism showed no bias in the genomic location of SVs. Based on these findings and the high rates of co-morbidity between DD and CHD, the first aim characterizes structural variation at TAD boundaries and other non-coding regulatory regions in CHD relative to controls, and will further determine whether TADs are enriched for SVs in a region-specific manner based on proximity to genes active in the developing heart. In the second aim, we use a complementary annotation- agnostic deep learning approach developed in our group to predict chromatin contact changes as a result of genetic variants in CHD patients. We will use Hi-C sequencing to confirm the model-predicted chromatin contact effects in iPSC-derived endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, and additionally use RNA sequencing to determine whether the hypothesized transcriptional disruption occurred. Finally, in the third aim we will create a model that uses genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional features of genetic variants found in each individual to predict their phenotypic status. By analyzing the relative importance of features used to make predictions, we will be able to determine what types of biological mechanisms and pathways are most predictive for congenital heart anomalies. Collectively, these findings will elucidate a currently underappreciated source of regulatory disruption in human development, identify new disease-relevant genes and potential therapeutic targets, and will refine and validate a method for the high-throughput prediction of chromatin contact frequency to advance the field of 3D genomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE As the leading cause of defect-associated infant mortality, congenital heart defects have been studied extensively to better understand their underlying genetic mechanisms. However, previous approaches have focused on direct mutations to protein-coding elements and were not sufficient to explain the full heritability of this disease. Our proposal posits that an underappreciated disease mechanism is transcriptional misregulation during development caused by variants that disrupt 3D genome organization, and we therefore aim to characterize the extent to which this occurs in human heart defects and validate specific examples.",High-throughput computational modeling to assess the role of 3D genome folding in human congenital anomalies,10138298,F31HL156439,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'ChIP-seq', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fetal Heart', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heritability', 'Hi-C', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Mortality', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Live Birth', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Trees', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'comorbidity', 'congenital anomaly', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'epigenomics', 'exome', 'falls', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'in silico', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'malformation', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F31,2021,37830
"Measuring allele and isoform-specific RBP binding to improve predictive models of RNA splicing PROJECT SUMMARY Alternative splicing (AS) is a fundamental cellular process that regulates 95% of multi-exon genes to diversify protein output and define cell-type specific functions. Both constitutive splicing and AS are controlled by combinations of cis-acting pre-messenger RNA sequences (pre-mRNA) and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Therefore, defects in splicing regulatory RNA sequence or RBPs can be highly disruptive to basic cellular activities and often lead to disease, especially neurological and muscular disorders and cancer. While the constitutive splicing code is well established, the AS code is more complicated and, thus, poorly understood. This proposal integrates multiple cutting-edge approaches to take an RBP-centric view of AS to study both cis genetic variants and trans RBP expression effects on RBP binding and splicing outcome. While thousands of non-coding genetic variants are associated with splicing variation, and are thus termed putative splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs), the causal variants and their molecular effects, such as RBP binding, are largely unclear. Aim 1 will address this gap by integrating RBP-focused experiments, allele-specific genomics, and state- of-the-art machine learning predictive models to characterize an important category of functional, cis non-coding variants that alter RBP binding. Importantly, I will take a unique approach to include these allele-specific RBP binding data as additional training data for our Convolutional Neural Net model. Model output is expected to much more accurately predict functional RBP binding effects of even a single nucleotide change in sequence, enabling improved interpretation of sQTLs. In addition to genetic variant effects, changes in RBP expression can have amplified downstream effects on RNA splicing. Interestingly, ~86% of RBP genes can be expressed as more than one splice isoform, but most studies to date have ignored RBP isoform-specific abundance and function. Aim 2 will provide foundational experiments to understand differential RBP isoform effects by using a novel approach to knockdown RBP isoforms by targeting Cas13 to unique exon junctions. Data from downstream assays that assess changes in RBP binding, splicing, and RNA localization will be integrated to construct the most comprehensive RBP regulatory networks to date. Results from both aims are essential to mechanistically link RNA sequence and RBP binding to splicing outcome and, ultimately, to phenotype and disease. My long-term goal is to become a principal investigator, where I will continue to leverage molecular biology, machine learning, and statistical genetics to answer unique questions about RNA-mediated associations between non-coding sequence and cellular and disease phenotype. The research and training plans proposed here are strategically tailored to provide ample opportunities to learn and apply machine learning and statistical genetics methods that complement my former PhD training in molecular biology and genomics. My sponsor, co- sponsor, and collaborators at the NYGC are committed to providing the scientific expertise, computational training, and career development mentoring to ensure the successful achievement of my goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Splicing is one of the earliest RNA processing events that regulates nearly every gene in every cell, thereby driving cell-type diversity and function. Mis-regulation at the level of splicing due to genetic variants in RNA sequence or defects in regulatory RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are highly disruptive to basic molecular processes and often lead to disease.

"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites.

"Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. One of the main challenges is how to efficiently visualize chromatin interaction data, so that the scientific community to visualize and use it for their own research. In addition, due to the complex experimental procedure and high sequencing cost, Hi-C has only been performed in a limited number of cell/tissue types. Finally, the underlying mechanism of chromatin interactions remains largely unclear. Therefore, the PI will propose the following aims: Aim 1. Build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser. We will build an interactive and customizable 3D browser, which allows users to navigate Hi-C data and other high-throughput chromatin organization data, including ChIA-PET and Capture Hi-C. We have built a prototype of the 3D genome browser (www.3dgenome.org). Our browser will allow users to conveniently browse chromatin interaction data with other data types (such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq) from the genomic region in the same window simultaneously. Our system will also empower the users to create their own session and query their own Hi-C and other epigenomic data. Aim 2. Impute chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomic information. We will predict Hi-C interaction frequencies using other available genomic and epigenomic data in the same cell type, such as ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications and transcription factors. We will build our prediction model and then systematically impute Hi-C interaction matrices for all 127 cell types whose epigenomes are available thanks to recent effort by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome projects. Aim 3. Perform validation experiments for computational method in aim 1 and 2. We will perform 20 3C experiments in hESC and GM cell lines, coupled with genome engineering by CRISPR/Cas9, to evaluate Hi-C prediction method in aim 2. The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Although several recent high-throughput technologies including Hi-C have emerged and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study 3D chromatin interaction in high resolution, its analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. Here we propose to develop a suite of statistical modeling and computational methods to model and validate chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomics data, and build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser.","Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data",10075940,R01HG009906,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Hi-C', 'Intuition', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Procedures', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome browser', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'interest', 'mammalian genome', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'repository', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web site']",NHGRI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,395000
"Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing Large consortium efforts have collected hundreds of genome-wide datasets that have delineated myriad regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and large numbers of coding and non-coding transcripts. Even with this massive amount of data, it remains a significant challenge to determine how the mapped elements function together in regulatory networks. This is due in large part to our inability to accurately and quantitatively detect all forms of nascent transcription, the instantaneous output of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our understanding of global gene regulation is restricted by a lack of computational tools that seamlessly integrate genome-wide datasets. The overall goal of this proposal is to maximize the impact of nascent transcriptome studies and enable facile integration with other functional genomic data. My group developed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), that enables the strand-specific nucleotide-resolution mapping of RNA polymerase density, highlighting all transcriptional activity regardless of transcript half-lives and revealing precise positions of Pol II pausing where regulatory control is applied. Here, we will develop a new version of NET-seq – NET-seq 2.0 – that enables the routine, scalable and flexible application to diverse human cell types (or any eukaryotic system). Moreover, we will increase the potential of NET-seq analysis by developing two innovative bioinformatics strategies to seamlessly integrate NET-seq data with other genome-wide datasets that will have applications beyond NET-seq studies. To demonstrate the broad utility of our integrated approach, we will study regulatory networks and cell differentiation for which instantaneous nascent transcriptional analysis will be highly impactful. In Aim 1, our goal is to make NET-seq easier, cheaper, and more flexible. Our improvements will reduce background and increase usable reads, dramatically reduce cell input requirements (100-1000-fold), enable dense, region-specific RNA transcription analyses, and enable quantitative comparisons between samples and conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine transcription kinetics through integrating NET-seq with metabolic RNA labeling (TT-seq) data which report local synthesis rates. This integrative approach yields a rich transcriptional phenotype that we will use to develop gene regulatory network models. In Aim 3, we will create new computational algorithms that circumvent the need to determine each molecular event separately, and instead infer the status of unmapped events using information-rich datasets, such as NET-seq. We will use integrative deep neural networks (`deep-learning') that use available genome-wide datasets to predict unavailable datasets from data already on hand. We will apply this approach to study erythropoiesis using a well- defined primary human hematopoietic differentiation system by a time series NET-seq and DNase-seq analysis. These data will inform deep neural network models to predict ChIP-seq data for myriad transcription factors and chromatin marks to investigate key regulatory events without additional expense. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because discovery of regulatory mechanisms in transcription at high resolution is ultimately expected to significantly impact our understanding of most human disease. As such, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that seeks to develop fundamental knowledge to inform our diagnosis and treatment of human disease.",Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing,10171878,R01HG007173,"['Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Consumption', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'KDM1A gene', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'RNA purification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribonucleases', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Small Nucleolar RNA', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'hematopoietic differentiation', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'network models', 'novel', 'promoter', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NHGRI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,513500
"Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization and 1D epigenome Abstract After the completion of the Human Genome Project, thousands of experiments from ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have successfully proﬁled regulatory elements and epigenetic landscape along the genome. More recently, over 2,000 chromatin organization datasets have been generated from 4D Nucleome (4DN) Project, and they provide complementary information about how these genomic and epigenomic elements are spatially organized in a nucleus. Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization with previously proﬁled 1D epigenome in different cell types will be a key step to understand the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation over long genomic distances. However, there are two challenges. First, there is a resolution mismatch between chromatin organization data (e.g. Hi-C contacts) which are usually measured at 10k base pair resolution, and epigenome-based chromatin state features (e.g. ChIP-seq peaks) whose signals are usually at tens to hundreds of base pairs. Second, existing computational approaches for analyzing epigenome, such as annotating genome and understanding regulatory elements, all treat the DNA sequence as one-dimensional data, leaving the important 3D structural information unutilized. We aim to develop the most cutting-edge deep learning approaches for understanding the relationship between chromatin state features and chromatin organization, performing 3D and 4D genome annotation, and identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors, respectively. After the completion of the proposed work, we expect to have: (1) an accurate and interpretable computational model to predict chromatin contact maps at nucleosome resolution for a wide range of cell lines, (2) 3D and 4D genome annotations over dynamic chromatin organization, regulatory elements and epigenomic features, and (3) a computational method for identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors which can help us understand the orchestration of noncoding genetic variants. These results will provide fundamental understanding of disease-relevant genetic variation in the light of the spatial organization of these genomic and epigenomic elements and their functional implications. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel computational methods to jointly analyze 3D chromatin organization data and 1D epigenomic features, and reveal the interplay among regulatory elements, epigenomic features, and dynamic chromatin organization. These new methods will help us understand the mechanisms of the genetic variants identiﬁed in genome-wide association studies, and understand the genetic basis of many human diseases.",Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization and 1D epigenome,10251159,R35HG011279,"['3-Dimensional', 'Base Pairing', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hi-C', 'Human Genome Project', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nucleosomes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'genome annotation', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'novel', 'three dimensional structure', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R35,2021,439299
