"Mobile based Nanoplasmonic Quantification of Mtb-derived Exosomes in Serum for Pediatric TB diagnosis Project Summary/Abstract  There were an estimated 10.4 million tuberculosis (TB) cases, and 170,000 TB pediatric deaths in 2015, with >95% of TB deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Rapid diagnosis is essential for improved TB outcomes, but diagnosis is more difficult in children, since children are less likely to exhibit typical TB symptoms and have paucibacillary (few bacteria) TB cases that are more difficult to detect by current methods, while parents are often resistant to stressful TB sample collection procedures. We therefore propose to explore a novel rapid, accurate, low-cost and easy-to-use mobile phone-based blood test for pediatric TB diagnosis in LMIC settings. Our novel detection method rapidly quantifies circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from host cells infected with the TB pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Our preliminary data indicate that we can rapidly quantitate EVs carrying Mtb biomarkers, such as lipoarabinomannan and LpqH, in pediatric TB patient blood samples using a mobile-phone-based dark-field microscope (MDFM) platform. These findings support our long-term goal to develop a low-cost system to improve pediatric TB diagnosis in LMIC settings. We also anticipate that this system will allow rapid treatment monitoring to improve therapy and reduce exposure of pediatric patients to toxic anti-TB drugs. To achieve these outcomes we propose to pursue three goals.  We collected our preliminary data with a MDFM that imaged transmitted light, but plan to design, develop, and validate the Aim 1 compact MDFM with a reflected light path to decrease the size of the device, simplify imagery, and increase the physical stability of the system. We will also develop a user-friendly application for image capture and data analysis on this platform. These features should markedly increase its feasibility for use in LMIC settings. Aim 2 will optimize assay performance for LMIC settings by redesigning assay materials for long-term storage under ambient conditions, and by determining optimal incubation times for different LMIC ambient temperature ranges. Aim 3 will analyze candidate Mtb-EV markers, including lipoarabinomannan and LpqH, build and a diagnostic model based on a multiple logistic regression algorithm, and validate diagnostic thresholds in separate validation cohort of pediatric TB patients and healthy controls with traceable clinical information. It will also compare the diagnostic performance of this multi-marker Mtb-EV assay to traditional diagnostic methods to evaluate its relative diagnostic performance.  Our approach offers several innovative features valuable for pediatric TB control. It quantifies stable TB biomarkers on EVs in serum (1µL), rather than detecting Mtb in difficult to obtain, variable, non-quantitative and infectious biopsies. It employs a novel, compact MDFM and a nanoparticle-based end-point assay that is stable at ambient conditions. Finally, the ability of this approach to quantitate Mtb-EVs should allow rapid evaluation of disease severity for real-time monitoring of treatment efficacy and cures to minimize toxic drug exposure times. Project Narrative There is an urgent need for novel approaches for rapid diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis cases to improve patient outcomes in low- and middle-income countries, which may lack resources and trained personnel. This proposal will develop a mobile phone-based device and a rapid tuberculosis assay that detects circulating extracellular vesicles secreted by infected cells in blood, both of which will be inexpensive and user-friendly to allow easy use by individuals with minimal training in resource-limited areas. This low-risk, high-reward approach is fundamentally different from traditional diagnostic methods, and it offers several advantages for diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis cases, including the use of serum rather than sputum or other biopsies that can be difficult to obtain in young children.",Mobile based Nanoplasmonic Quantification of Mtb-derived Exosomes in Serum for Pediatric TB diagnosis,10019544,R21EB026347,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bacillus', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Dark-Field Microscope', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Disease', 'Drug Exposure', 'End Point Assay', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Housing', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Light', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Reading', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Slide', 'Sputum', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'antibody conjugate', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'communicable disease diagnosis', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic assay', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder control', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'high reward', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lens', 'lipoarabinomannan', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microscopic imaging', 'nanoparticle', 'nanoplasmonic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pediatric patients', 'portability', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'rapid technique', 'real time monitoring', 'regression algorithm', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'transmission process', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis diagnostics', 'tuberculosis drugs', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R21,2020,179885,0.37857124053208185
"Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. Despite recent scientific advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for control and eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. PLWH with latent TB infection (LTBI) have a ~10% annual risk of progressing to TB disease, however currently available tests for LTBI diagnosis have reduced sensitivity in this population and are not able to predict which latently infected individuals are at highest risk for developing TB for targeted preventive therapy. Emerging data from clinically relevant animal models suggest that LTBI and active TB represent a spectrum of immune responses and host pathology, with increasing metabolic changes and immune dysregulation during the transition to TB disease. We have identified unique serum metabolite and microRNA (miRNA) profiles that are able to discriminate between patients with TB and those with non-TB lung disease. However, these novel TB signatures have not been assessed prospectively to identify PLWH and HIV-negative persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for TB progression. In order to address this significant knowledge gap, in Aim 1 of the current research program, trainees will leverage the Indian and South African RePORT longitudinal biorepositories of household contacts of TB index cases to test the hypothesis that TB is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with profound changes in immune regulation and metabolism prior to the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Another major barrier to global TB eradication efforts is the lengthy and complicated current anti-tubercular regimen, which is associated with medical nonadherence and the emergence of drug resistance. Recently, attention has focused on host-directed adjunctive therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to the pathogen and improving lung damage. Lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) are central to maintaining chronic TB infection by providing a favorable niche in which antimicrobial functions are down-regulated, and by inducing caseation and tissue damage. Recent work has shown that foam-cell-rich and necrotic areas of TB granulomas are particularly enriched in triglycerides. Mtb infection is associated with dysregulation of two cellular pathways involved in triglyceride homeostasis: a pro-lipogenic pathway involving protein kinase B and mTOR complex 1 (Akt/mTORC1), and an anti- lipogenic pathway involving AMP-activated protein kinase and the sirtuins (AMPK/SIRT). In Aim 2, trainees will use longitudinal clinical samples from RePORT study participants and experimental infections ex vivo to characterize: (i) the relationship between activation of these pathways and control of clinical Mtb infection, and the effect of anti-lipogenic treatments on antimycobacterial functions of human macrophages infected ex vivo. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters development of high impact patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence. Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the most deadly infections worldwide, especially among people living with HIV. Current available tests are not able to accurately detect persons at the highest risk of developing TB, and curing the disease requires at least 6 months of therapy because the TB bacteria can avoid being killed by the immune system and currently available drugs. In the current proposal, physician scientists will receive training in a variety of complementary disciplines, and use several cutting-edge experimental and modeling techniques to analyze samples from patients with TB and TB/HIV, with the ultimate goal of identifying new biomarkers that can predict TB disease and host-directed therapies that can shorten TB treatment.",Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV,9975724,K24AI143447,"['5&apos', '-AMP-activated protein kinase', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimycobacterial Agents', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Foam Cells', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV/TB', 'Homeostasis', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompetent', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lipid-Laden Macrophage', 'Lipids', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sirtuins', 'South African', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'antimicrobial', 'biobank', 'biosignature', 'career', 'chronic inflammatory disease', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'high risk', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lifetime risk', 'lung injury', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient oriented research', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tuberculosis granuloma', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K24,2020,191195,0.4353289596099553
"Host Proteomic Biosignatures for a Urine-based Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children PROJECT ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. Difficulty in obtaining sputum and a low sputum bacillary load are major barriers to diagnosis, and necessitate the development of a non-sputum, biomarker-based assay for childhood intrathoracic TB disease. Host biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires a greater focus on downstream proteins and their post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are more likely to be specific to a disease phenotype and can be more easily translated into a point-of-care test. With the support of this K23 award, Dr. Devan Jaganath will identify a host proteomic biosignature in urine that can achieve the goal accuracy for a triage and/or diagnostic test for pulmonary TB in children. To complete this objective, he will leverage an ongoing prospective cohort of symptomatic children being evaluated for intrathoracic TB in Kampala, Uganda, with the extensive proteomic facilities available at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). In Aim 1, he will perform targeted mass spectrometry on urine samples from children with confirmed vs. unlikely TB, and examine the abundance and ubiquitylation of 10 host proteins that have prior evidence of specific interactions with M. tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins as candidate biomarkers. In Aim 2, he will use shotgun mass spectrometry on the urine samples to identify all host proteins and their PTMs that can differentiate TB status as novel biomarkers, and perform pathway analysis to determine the subset with functional relevance to Mtb pathogenesis. In Aim 3, he will apply machine learning analyses to identify the smallest combination of biomarkers that can achieve the target accuracy thresholds for a triage and/or diagnostic test for intrathoracic TB disease. He will then evaluate the performance of promising biosignatures in an independent, prospectively enrolled test set. Through this approach, Dr. Jaganath seeks to optimize biomarker discovery for childhood TB diagnosis by coupling prospective clinical cohorts with a targeted and untargeted high-throughput approach to comprehensively examine non-sputum samples for host biomarkers for children. Dr. Jaganath's career goal is to be a physician scientist who translates non-sputum biomarkers into clinical tools that can improve the care of children with TB. To support his path to independence, the proposed work will be paired with a dedicated, multidisciplinary mentorship team and training in international pediatric TB biomarker studies, bioinformatics for proteomic analysis, and machine learning. UCSF is an outstanding environment that is committed to junior investigators with extensive resources for research and career development, and Mulago National Referral Hospital in Uganda is a leader in pediatric TB research, and has the established infrastructure for ongoing enrollment and sample collection. The findings will support an NIH R01 application to validate the biomarkers and biosignatures in large, diverse cohorts in comparison to existing non-sputum diagnostics. Thus, the K23 award will provide Dr. Jaganath with the critical mentorship, training, resources and experience to become an independent investigator who can make important contributions to the field of childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE More than half of the estimated tuberculosis (TB) disease cases in children worldwide have not been reported to the health system, and 96% of pediatric TB deaths are in children not started on treatment. The proposed project seeks to address the key barriers in diagnosing pulmonary TB in children through discovery of a host proteomic biosignature in urine. The findings will be relevant to the public health efforts to reduce the burden of TB in children and will support the development of a non-invasive, non-sputum based assay for childhood TB disease at the point-of-care.",Host Proteomic Biosignatures for a Urine-based Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children,10038668,K23HL153581,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Bedside Testings', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Hospital Referrals', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Immunoassay', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Shotguns', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'biosignature', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'point of care', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'protein biomarkers', 'research and development', 'sample collection', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,209400,0.38167674484207115
"Signature of profiling and staging the progression of TB from infection to disease. Project Summary/Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide. Nearly one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). More than 10.4 million new cases of active TB disease develop annually, leading to 1.4 million deaths due to the disease each year. Despite widespread efforts to study of the etiology of disease, the development and global introduction of an effective treatment regimen, and sensitive diagnostics for identifying pulmonary TB disease, efforts to control this pandemic are falling short, largely due to a lack of a clear understanding of the pathogenic progression from MTB infection to active clinical disease. In addition, Existing gene expression studies have presented more than three dozen biomarkers to predict TB related outcomes such as identifying active TB disease, predicting risk of treatment failure, or predicting which patients will progress to active TB disease. These have been developed and refined using multiple technologies and using a diverse set of computational and machine learning prediction algorithms, but most are focused on two-class comparison (e.g. TB vs. LTBI). In this proposal, we propose to compile and harmonize dozens of existing RNA-sequencing datasets for TB outcomes. We will use these compiled data to develop a computational platform and interactive visualization tools for profiling TB signatures across all existing datasets. We plan to use this curated data and software platform to develop a more refined molecular map of progression from TB infection to active disease. Consistent with a recently presented models for TB disease development, we hypothesize that we will be able to identify gene expression patterns associated with stages on the TB disease spectrum, including: uninfected or eliminated infection, controlled or truly latent infection, future progressors or incipient disease, subclinical TB disease, and active clinical TB disease. We believe that existing gene expression data and signatures will allow us to identify distinct transcriptional profiles for each stage, and hence develop a multi-class machine learning approach for classifying patients into their corresponding stage. Overall, this proposal contributes to the field by compiling existing gene expression data and developing a wholistic map of TB progression from infection to active disease. In addition, we will provide a curated dataset and metadata in an accessible format for more than three dozen existing TB studies, and allow others to access and explore these data through a user-friendly profiling platform.

"Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by an infectious pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in susceptible individuals, but we cannot yet classify or predict outcomes in those prone to pulmonary TB disease versus those prone to resistance. In part, this reflects knowledge gaps regarding genotypes that may increase susceptibility, and in validated disease correlates (e.g. serum of lung protein biomarkers) measured individually, or combined signatures. We address these knowledge gaps by using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a population with abundant genetic diversity and heterozygosity, like the human population. Also, like humans, a low dose M.tb infection of DO mice produces a spectrum of outcomes, from highly susceptible to highly resistant, and many intermediate outcomes. In this proposal, we use the DO population to: 1) Identify and test the capacity of genotypic (alleles and statistically significant loci) to predict outcomes such as diagnostic category (class); and 2) To identify and test lung and serum biomarker (protein) and granuloma signatures to determine diagnostic category (class); and 3) To identify and test serum biomarker (protein) signatures that can forecast disease onset, within a 3-week window before illness manifests clinically. The best performing signatures will be tested using samples from humans. Collectively, results from these studies will generate new translatable knowledge regarding correlates of pulmonary TB (useful for diagnostics), and genotypic and serum protein signatures (useful for prognostics). PROJECT NARRATIVE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) in millions of susceptible humans each year. It is well known that humans respond variably to M.tb infection, yet we are unable to predict outcomes with accuracy. Here, we use the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population to identify and test genotypic, serum, and lung biomarker signatures to accurately predict outcomes.

"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9852419,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferons', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'progression marker', 'random forest', 'research clinical testing', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,711592,0.4340737762955728
"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management by enabling personalized diagnosis of LTBI and the stratification of individuals with the highest potential for reactivation.",Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection,10006790,R01AI141591,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Regimen', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Silicon', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translations', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis', 'Whole Blood', 'antigen challenge', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'cytokine', 'data streams', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'feature selection', 'high risk', 'immune function', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'latent infection', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,722295,0.410442450837308
"Investigating bacterial contributions to TB treatment response: a focus on in-host pathogen dynamics Project Summary/Abstract Rapid and accurate methods to monitor tuberculosis (TB) treatment response do not currently exist. Efforts to improve outcomes have focused on early identification of rifampicin susceptibility followed by prompt treatment initiation and adherence monitoring. The rapid molecular susceptibility tests most often used give dichotomous cutoffs. Recent studies though show that minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) just below these breakpoints also predict poor outcomes. Even if a patient takes most of their therapy, clinical response can still vary substantially. Delays in sputum clearance (culture conversion from growth to no growth) can range from a few days to 5 months and failure or relapse rates can be as high as 20% in drug-susceptible TB. During the weeks to months of human infection and antibiotic treatment, in host Mtb populations experience substantial measurable genetic changes. These changes may be neutral or allow pathogen adaption to immune, antibiotic or metabolic pressure, e.g. low iron or cobalamin levels that may result in heritable drug tolerance and resistance phenotypes. Here we propose to study in host longitudinal pathogen dynamics including changes in population diversity over time and identify genes under selection to shed light on host-pathogen interactions. The study of in host pathogen dynamics can improve our understanding of cure from infection and pave the way for the use of whole genome sequencing for monitoring treatment response, circumventing the delays and biohazards of traditional culture-based approaches. We additionally propose the development of a genome- based predictor of MIC and to assess if MIC predictions are associated with delays in culture conversion and poor clinical response. We will systematically study pathogen samples from a well characterized TB treatment patient cohort (NIAID TRUST TB cohort in Worcester, South Africa -PI Dr. Jacobson) combining long and deep short-read sequencing to resolve full genome assemblies and variants at low allele frequency. We have strong preliminary data that long-read sequencing unmasks more Mtb genetic diversity than detectable by short-read sequencing alone and have previously characterized directional selection in a subset of genes including resistance loci, the B12 biosynthesis pathway, and PPE genes known to interact with host innate defense. The proposed work is enabled by our methodological expertise in population genetics, machine learning and resistance prediction for clonal bacteria like Mtb and will allow, for the first time, the study of directional and diversifying selection on the full repertoire of Mtb genetic variation. It will also allow the training of an MIC prediction model on a large ~17,000 isolate dataset curated across studies and geographies. Both study aims promise to inform our understanding of how pathogen genetic variation affects Mtb survival in host and the response to treatment. Project Narrative Patients with tuberculosis (TB) can benefit greatly if we could identify signs of poor response earlier and adjust therapy intensity accordingly. Innovations in DNA isolation and sequencing technologies now enable the study of TB pathogen populations in an individual patient with very high resolution. Here, we propose to use these technologies and a highly well-characterized cohort of South African TB patients to investigate how pathogen population genetic changes link to pathogen survival and treatment response, laying the foundation for improvements in clinical treatment monitoring using DNA sequencing.",Investigating bacterial contributions to TB treatment response: a focus on in-host pathogen dynamics,10100014,R01AI155765,"['Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Anabolism', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Attenuated', 'Bacteria', 'Biohazardous Substance', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cobalamin', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Drug resistance', 'ELF3 gene', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompetence', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Iron', 'Isoniazid resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Minor', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predisposition', 'Race', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regulator Genes', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Resolution', 'Rifampin', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'South Africa', 'South African', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sputum', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic variation', 'high risk', 'immunological status', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in silico', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'resistance gene', 'resistant strain', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis treatment', 'whole genome']",NIAID,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,781859,0.2255135734821425
"A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In 2015, tuberculosis (TB) surpassed HIV as the number one cause of infectious disease deaths worldwide. In the U.S., California has the highest incidence and largest number of TB cases in the nation, comprising nearly one-quarter of all new active TB cases in 2017. More than 80% of active TB disease in the U.S. is due to reactivation, which could be prevented via screening and treatment of LTBI. Yet, adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. The screening guidelines are inefficient and rely on data that are almost never available to clinicians, and the treatment guidelines are confusing. Further, treatment initiation and completion rates are low for patients with LTBI and the barriers to successful treatment are poorly understood. To address these missed opportunities, we will use expansive electronic health record data across 2 of the largest healthcare institutions in California as well as qualitative data from LTBI stakeholders to conduct three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will look at current gaps in screening practices for LTBI, as well as gaps in the guidelines themselves, by simulating what it would look like if screening was being perfectly implemented. To do this, we will collect laboratory testing data for LTBI stratified by characteristics of interest and will use modeling to estimate the number of TB cases prevented by current screening as a measure of effectiveness. We will use simulation models to estimate effectiveness of optimal screening. For Aim 2, we will develop and validate new screening and treatment guidelines for LTBI based on variables widely available in electronic health records. First, we will use machine learning and traditional regression to identify risk factors for positive LTBI tests and reactivation TB. Next, we will assign risk scores to each risk factor, and will use joint probability analyses to identify populations at greatest need for screening and treatment. To estimate performance of the newly proposed strategy, we will use simulation modeling. For Aim 3, we will develop and pilot a culturally-tailored educational video intervention to improve LTBI treatment initiation and completion. We will first identify barriers to treatment adherence through qualitative interviews with patients and providers and will subsequently develop a short video based on findings from the interview. We will perform an individually randomized efficacy trial to assess impact of the intervention on initiation and treatment completion rates. The approach is innovative because we propose a complete re-framing of the current U.S. LTBI control strategy in a way that dramatically enhances ease-of-use for frontline providers. Results of this work will make a significant contribution to public health by providing low-cost and easily expandable solutions to address ongoing and substantial gaps in the current LTBI care continuum. PROJECT NARRATIVE California has the highest incidence and largest number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the contiguous U.S., of which 80% are due to reactivation. These TB cases can be prevented via screening and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), yet, current adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor.

"Multiplexed Antigen-Specific Antibody Fc Profiling on a Chip for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of TB in HIV-infected Children Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death in children, with an estimated 1 million children affected, and more than 200,000 deaths in children yearly due to TB. HIV coinfection has been estimated to contribute to more than 35% of TB-related deaths in children in Africa, making the collision of the HIV and TB epidemics one of the most lethal to date. Both HIV infection as well as HIV-exposure in utero, among HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) children, have been linked to higher risks for the development of TB among young children. Failures to prevent TB disease and devastation has been attributed to the lack of an effective vaccine as well as our inability to diagnose children under the age of 5 due to the difficulty in obtaining sputum and the paucibacillary nature of the disease in young children. Thus, an inexpensive biomarker-based diagnostic test tailored for pediatric TB using non-sputum samples that could be used at the point of care in resource-limited settings could profoundly improve TB treatment and prevent deaths in children, especially in those under 5 years of age. While Mtb-specific antibody titer-based diagnostics have performed poorly in the past, due to the inability of accurately distinguishing between active TB disease from latent TB infection (LTBI), recent data from our group has shown that Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation shifts significantly across disease states. Moreover, this antigen-specific antibody glycosylation approach reliably classifies individuals into active and latent disease states across HIV infection status, across geographies and can even distinguish recent Typhoid infection among children in endemic areas. Based on these observations, a simple binding-based assay was developed that can rapidly, sensitively, and specifically detect changes in Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation from a small sample volume offering an opportunity for the first time to develop an antigen-specific antibody glycosylation diagnostic for pediatric TB from a microliter-scale sample. Given that HIV+, HEU, or unexposed children may target distinct Mtb antigens, here we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team and program termed FASTER-Kids (Fc Antibody Signatures for TubERculosis in children) that will: 1) Define the landscape of Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation responses that distinguish children with TB, 2) Develop a point-of-care test that will rapidly capture these specific antibody responses and glycosylation changes from microliters of blood. Ultimately, this collaborative structure will enable the iterative improvement and development of this simple, rapid, inexpensive diagnostic to manage TB infection in young children. Based on accumulating data pointing to highly significant shifts in TB-specific antibody glycosylation across latent and active TB disease, the goal of this proposal is to develop an inexpensive, simple, reliable TB-specific antibody-based point-of-care diagnostic to manage TB disease in children under the age of 5.",Multiplexed Antigen-Specific Antibody Fc Profiling on a Chip for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of TB in HIV-infected Children,9986268,R01AI152158,"['5 year old', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antibody titer measurement', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Bedside Testings', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV/TB', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'Polysaccharides', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serologic tests', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'Typhoid Fever', 'Vaccines', 'base', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'glycosylation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'microchip', 'miniaturize', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pediatrician', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'sensor', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,974009,0.3263218783901307
"Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings PROJECT SUMMARY There is an urgent need to develop non-sputum biomarker-based triage and diagnostic tests for childhood tuberculosis (TB). This is particularly important for young children with HIV infection, who have high TB-related mortality but often cannot produce sputum and have lower sputum bacillary burden. Biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires ultra-sensitive platforms to measure low-abundant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins in clinical samples and greater investigation of host proteins, post-translational modifications of proteins, and metabolites that are more likely than upstream RNA expression to reflect the host-pathogen interactions that lead to TB disease. The overall objective of the proposed project is to identify Mtb- and/or host-derived biosignatures in children that can achieve World Health Organization (WHO) target product profile (TPP) accuracy thresholds for a non-sputum biomarker-based triage or diagnostic test for childhood TB. We hypothesize that biosignatures that combine Mtb proteins and host biomarkers with evidence of functional relevance to TB pathogenesis or immunity will have the best diagnostic performance. To assess this hypothesis, we will conduct biomarker discovery and initial clinical validation studies using samples from three well- characterized pediatric TB cohorts in Uganda, The Gambia and South Africa. In Aim 1, we will use an ultra- sensitive electrochemoluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay to assess the presence of Mtb proteins ESAT- 6, CFP-10, MPT64, MPT32, and Ag85B in a discovery set of banked blood and urine samples from 100 children under 5 years old with confirmed TB and 200 with unlikely TB per NIH consensus definitions (50% HIV prevalence in both groups). In Aim 2, we will use the same discovery set to perform targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry with functional assessment through pathway analysis, in vitro models and in vivo mouse models to identify host proteins, post-translational modifications and metabolites that distinguish children with confirmed versus unlikely TB. In Aim 3, we will use the candidate Mtb and host biomarkers identified in Aims 1 and 2 to derive biosignatures with up to 10 analytes consisting of Mtb proteins only, host biomarkers only, and both Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers. Biosignatures that meet WHO TPP criteria in the discovery set will 1) be evaluated in an independent test set of banked samples from 300 children under 5 years old (100 with confirmed TB, 200 with unlikely TB; 50% HIV prevalence in each group) to verify diagnostic accuracy and establish cut- offs and 2) be evaluated in a prospective cohort of 350 children under 5 years old using the pre-select cut-offs and both microbiological and clinical reference standards. Completion of these aims will result in identification of promising biosignatures that can be further validated in large-scale field studies and translated into point-of-care triage and/or diagnostic tests for childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE The inability to quickly and accurately diagnose tuberculosis (TB) in children and initiate treatment is a major contributor to the high mortality of childhood TB worldwide. This study will identify novel Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers, and determine the best biomarker panels (i.e., biosignatures) that can meet the World Health Organization-recommended diagnostic accuracy thresholds for a TB triage or diagnostic test. If successful, the results will the first step needed to make progress toward addressing the critical unmet need for non-sputum biomarker-based tests for childhood TB.",Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings,9986338,R01AI152161,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Banks', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gambia', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV/TB', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'Immunoassay', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Tryptophan', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'biosignature', 'clinical research site', 'clinically relevant', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'field study', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'ion mobility', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'transcriptomics', 'tuberculosis diagnostics', 'validation studies']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,1503586,0.361881144254213
"Mobile based Nanoplasmonic Quantification of Mtb-derived Exosomes in Serum for Pediatric TB diagnosis Project Summary/Abstract  There were an estimated 10.4 million tuberculosis (TB) cases, and 170,000 TB pediatric deaths in 2015, with >95% of TB deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Rapid diagnosis is essential for improved TB outcomes, but diagnosis is more difficult in children, since children are less likely to exhibit typical TB symptoms and have paucibacillary (few bacteria) TB cases that are more difficult to detect by current methods, while parents are often resistant to stressful TB sample collection procedures. We therefore propose to explore a novel rapid, accurate, low-cost and easy-to-use mobile phone-based blood test for pediatric TB diagnosis in LMIC settings. Our novel detection method rapidly quantifies circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from host cells infected with the TB pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Our preliminary data indicate that we can rapidly quantitate EVs carrying Mtb biomarkers, such as lipoarabinomannan and LpqH, in pediatric TB patient blood samples using a mobile-phone-based dark-field microscope (MDFM) platform. These findings support our long-term goal to develop a low-cost system to improve pediatric TB diagnosis in LMIC settings. We also anticipate that this system will allow rapid treatment monitoring to improve therapy and reduce exposure of pediatric patients to toxic anti-TB drugs. To achieve these outcomes we propose to pursue three goals.  We collected our preliminary data with a MDFM that imaged transmitted light, but plan to design, develop, and validate the Aim 1 compact MDFM with a reflected light path to decrease the size of the device, simplify imagery, and increase the physical stability of the system. We will also develop a user-friendly application for image capture and data analysis on this platform. These features should markedly increase its feasibility for use in LMIC settings. Aim 2 will optimize assay performance for LMIC settings by redesigning assay materials for long-term storage under ambient conditions, and by determining optimal incubation times for different LMIC ambient temperature ranges. Aim 3 will analyze candidate Mtb-EV markers, including lipoarabinomannan and LpqH, build and a diagnostic model based on a multiple logistic regression algorithm, and validate diagnostic thresholds in separate validation cohort of pediatric TB patients and healthy controls with traceable clinical information. It will also compare the diagnostic performance of this multi-marker Mtb-EV assay to traditional diagnostic methods to evaluate its relative diagnostic performance.  Our approach offers several innovative features valuable for pediatric TB control. It quantifies stable TB biomarkers on EVs in serum (1µL), rather than detecting Mtb in difficult to obtain, variable, non-quantitative and infectious biopsies. It employs a novel, compact MDFM and a nanoparticle-based end-point assay that is stable at ambient conditions. Finally, the ability of this approach to quantitate Mtb-EVs should allow rapid evaluation of disease severity for real-time monitoring of treatment efficacy and cures to minimize toxic drug exposure times. Project Narrative There is an urgent need for novel approaches for rapid diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis cases to improve patient outcomes in low- and middle-income countries, which may lack resources and trained personnel. This proposal will develop a mobile phone-based device and a rapid tuberculosis assay that detects circulating extracellular vesicles secreted by infected cells in blood, both of which will be inexpensive and user-friendly to allow easy use by individuals with minimal training in resource-limited areas. This low-risk, high-reward approach is fundamentally different from traditional diagnostic methods, and it offers several advantages for diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis cases, including the use of serum rather than sputum or other biopsies that can be difficult to obtain in young children.",Mobile based Nanoplasmonic Quantification of Mtb-derived Exosomes in Serum for Pediatric TB diagnosis,9773333,R21EB026347,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bacillus (bacterium)', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Dark-Field Microscope', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Disease', 'Drug Exposure', 'End Point Assay', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Housing', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Light', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Reading', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Slide', 'Sputum', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'antibody conjugate', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'communicable disease diagnosis', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic assay', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder control', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'high reward', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lens', 'lipoarabinomannan', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microscopic imaging', 'nanoparticle', 'nanoplasmonic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pediatric patients', 'portability', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'rapid technique', 'real time monitoring', 'regression algorithm', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'transmission process', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis diagnostics', 'tuberculosis drugs', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R21,2019,186679,0.37857124053208185
"Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. Despite recent scientific advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for control and eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. PLWH with latent TB infection (LTBI) have a ~10% annual risk of progressing to TB disease, however currently available tests for LTBI diagnosis have reduced sensitivity in this population and are not able to predict which latently infected individuals are at highest risk for developing TB for targeted preventive therapy. Emerging data from clinically relevant animal models suggest that LTBI and active TB represent a spectrum of immune responses and host pathology, with increasing metabolic changes and immune dysregulation during the transition to TB disease. We have identified unique serum metabolite and microRNA (miRNA) profiles that are able to discriminate between patients with TB and those with non-TB lung disease. However, these novel TB signatures have not been assessed prospectively to identify PLWH and HIV-negative persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for TB progression. In order to address this significant knowledge gap, in Aim 1 of the current research program, trainees will leverage the Indian and South African RePORT longitudinal biorepositories of household contacts of TB index cases to test the hypothesis that TB is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with profound changes in immune regulation and metabolism prior to the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Another major barrier to global TB eradication efforts is the lengthy and complicated current anti-tubercular regimen, which is associated with medical nonadherence and the emergence of drug resistance. Recently, attention has focused on host-directed adjunctive therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to the pathogen and improving lung damage. Lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) are central to maintaining chronic TB infection by providing a favorable niche in which antimicrobial functions are down-regulated, and by inducing caseation and tissue damage. Recent work has shown that foam-cell-rich and necrotic areas of TB granulomas are particularly enriched in triglycerides. Mtb infection is associated with dysregulation of two cellular pathways involved in triglyceride homeostasis: a pro-lipogenic pathway involving protein kinase B and mTOR complex 1 (Akt/mTORC1), and an anti- lipogenic pathway involving AMP-activated protein kinase and the sirtuins (AMPK/SIRT). In Aim 2, trainees will use longitudinal clinical samples from RePORT study participants and experimental infections ex vivo to characterize: (i) the relationship between activation of these pathways and control of clinical Mtb infection, and the effect of anti-lipogenic treatments on antimycobacterial functions of human macrophages infected ex vivo. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters development of high impact patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence. Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the most deadly infections worldwide, especially among people living with HIV. Current available tests are not able to accurately detect persons at the highest risk of developing TB, and curing the disease requires at least 6 months of therapy because the TB bacteria can avoid being killed by the immune system and currently available drugs. In the current proposal, physician scientists will receive training in a variety of complementary disciplines, and use several cutting-edge experimental and modeling techniques to analyze samples from patients with TB and TB/HIV, with the ultimate goal of identifying new biomarkers that can predict TB disease and host-directed therapies that can shorten TB treatment.",Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV,9846869,K24AI143447,"['5&apos', '-AMP-activated protein kinase', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimycobacterial Agents', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Foam Cells', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV/TB', 'Homeostasis', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lipid-Laden Macrophage', 'Lipids', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sirtuins', 'South African', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'antimicrobial', 'biobank', 'biosignature', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'high risk', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lifetime risk', 'lung injury', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient oriented research', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tuberculosis granuloma', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K24,2019,191195,0.4353289596099553
"A Study to Validate and Improve an Automated Image Analysis Algorithm to Detect Tuberculosis in Sputum Smear Slides Abstract/Summary In this SBIR, we propose to validate our handcrafted image analysis algorithm for auto-detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in a digitized sputum smear. Once validated in a blinded study against manual microscopy and culture (the gold standard), we will try to improve our handcrafted algorithm by integrating, where appropriate, deep-learning approaches (via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)). Our novel diagnostic device (the Diascopic iON platform) uses automated image analysis to detect pathogens of interest. Through a blinded study (400 slides), we will assess the iON's effectiveness in detecting MTB. Our aim is to achieve >99% accuracy vs. microscopy, and sensitivity-specificity vs. culture of 80% and 99%, respectively. Currently, the iON platform can detect MTB on a Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stained sputum smear in less than 60 seconds, with accuracy of 95% vs. microscopy. The primary objective of this SBIR is to meet or exceed the minimal requirements for the WHO Target Product Profile (published 2014) of a rapid sputum-based test for detecting TB at the microscopy-center level of the health-care system. We will accomplish this feasibility study through a collaborative effort with the Case Western Reserve University-Uganda (UCRC) research team. A full-slide digitization and automated image analysis of 400 ZN slides is planned while on the ground in Uganda. Results will be published in an appropriate peer-reviewed journal for dissemination to the relevant TB pathology and provider community. A secondary objective of this SBIR is to improve our handcrafted algorithm through the use of deep- learning techniques (CNN). We will collaborate with Dr. Madabhushi (Case Western Reserve) - a world leader in Deep Learning methodologies – on this portion of the study. We are optimistic that by combining our handcrafted approach with a deep-learning approach, we can identify MTB bacilli more effectively (i.e. faster and more accurately). We will leverage the lessons-learned in this study to develop algorithms for other developing-world diseases like Onchocerca (river blindness), Plasmodium (malaria), and Shistomes (schistosomaisis). Successful completion of this SBIR will show that the iON can truly become a platform for automated pathogen detection, which will shift lab practices toward faster & more standardized routines that are performed by unskilled workers. If we're successful in this Phase I SBIR, we will develop auto-detect algorithms for 3-4 other pathogens in a phase II SBIR. We will then market the iON platform to resource-limited clinics in countries adversely affected by developing-world diseases. It is our experience that such clinics are seeking a rapid, low cost, accurate and simple diagnostic tool to improve their efficiency and their ability to detect and treat diseases. Narrative This SBIR is a validation study of a digital pathology platform to detect TB in digitized Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN) slides. We aim to establish a high accuracy (>99%) vs. manual microscopy and a sensitivity & specificity of 80% and 99%, respectively, vs. culture. The TB analysis occurs rapidly, with results available in <60 seconds. We will investigate whether algorithm improvements are possible by combining our handcrafted approach with deep-learning approaches to improve accuracy and efficiency. If high accuracy and sensitivity-specificity can be achieved for TB detection, this low-cost technology can have a significant impact on TB laboratory operations around the world. The technology can also be applied to other pathogens whose primary method of detection is microscopy.",A Study to Validate and Improve an Automated Image Analysis Algorithm to Detect Tuberculosis in Sputum Smear Slides,9851233,R43EB028736,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Bacillus (bacterium)', 'Blinded', 'Case Study', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Ions', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Low income', 'Malaria', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Ocular Onchocerciasis', 'Onchocerca', 'Pathogen detection', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plasmodium', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Slide', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Sputum', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'Universities', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'digital pathology', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'man', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'operation', 'pathogen', 'portability', 'prevent', 'remote location', 'tool', 'tuberculosis diagnostics', 'validation studies']",NIBIB,"DIASCOPIC, LLC",R43,2019,225000,0.17074767245053402
"SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to reduce the burden of Tuberculosis (TB) are challenged by the persistent social inequalities in health, the limited number of local healthcare professionals, and the weak healthcare infrastructure found in resource-poor communities. Reducing the TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the TB epidemic in high-burden areas. The main objective of this proposal is to expedite the TB diagnosis process by developing novel image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images thus reducing patient wait times for being diagnosed with TB. The study will be conducted in the district of Carabayllo, a densely occupied, high-burden TB area in Lima, the capital of Perú. Efforts to develop the proposed user-centered, mobile device-based computing system are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and its strategic goals 2 and 4 in particular-the proposed socio-technical intervention aims at developing biomedical imaging techniques (i.e. wireless and image sensing/analyzing) to enable a point-of-care mobile device-based computing system for TB screening and diagnostic. Anticipated outcomes include a) a large-scale, real-world, well-annotated, and public available chest X-ray image database for TB screening, b) development of new image analysis techniques for X-ray image capturing and pre- processing, and c) novel learning-based feature extraction and classification algorithms. This  interdisciplinary effort, involving community, university, hospitals and health care establishments in all stages of the research, responds to the need for increased partnerships between academia and community stakeholders, and the potential for building capacity in biomedical and technology solutions for health in both directions (North-South, South-North). Its scientific contribution lies in the intersection of three NIBIB scientific program areas including image processing, telehealth, and biomedical informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public and global health because it offers a socio-technical solution for resource-poor communities severely affected by TB. Outcomes of this project will contribute significantly to improving specific healthcare processes affecting hard-to-reach communities that are socially excluded and lack the benefits of technological advances while broadening our understanding about effective human centered designs to improve healthcare systems with mobile computing technologies.",SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies,9746721,R01EB021900,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Capital', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discipline', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peru', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'Underrepresented Students', 'University Hospitals', 'Vaccines', 'Wait Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'Woman', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical practice', 'community involvement', 'compliance behavior', 'data exchange', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'disadvantaged population', 'disease transmission', 'global health', 'handheld mobile device', 'image processing', 'improved', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'point of care', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'social', 'social inequality', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'tuberculosis diagnostics']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2019,334204,0.3811388030809886
"Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by an infectious pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in susceptible individuals, but we cannot yet classify or predict outcomes in those prone to pulmonary TB disease versus those prone to resistance. In part, this reflects knowledge gaps regarding genotypes that may increase susceptibility, and in validated disease correlates (e.g. serum of lung protein biomarkers) measured individually, or combined signatures. We address these knowledge gaps by using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a population with abundant genetic diversity and heterozygosity, like the human population. Also, like humans, a low dose M.tb infection of DO mice produces a spectrum of outcomes, from highly susceptible to highly resistant, and many intermediate outcomes. In this proposal, we use the DO population to: 1) Identify and test the capacity of genotypic (alleles and statistically significant loci) to predict outcomes such as diagnostic category (class); and 2) To identify and test lung and serum biomarker (protein) and granuloma signatures to determine diagnostic category (class); and 3) To identify and test serum biomarker (protein) signatures that can forecast disease onset, within a 3-week window before illness manifests clinically. The best performing signatures will be tested using samples from humans. Collectively, results from these studies will generate new translatable knowledge regarding correlates of pulmonary TB (useful for diagnostics), and genotypic and serum protein signatures (useful for prognostics). PROJECT NARRATIVE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) in millions of susceptible humans each year. It is well known that humans respond variably to M.tb infection, yet we are unable to predict outcomes with accuracy. Here, we use the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population to identify and test genotypic, serum, and lung biomarker signatures to accurately predict outcomes. Findings are also validated in samples from humans.",Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures,9642291,R01HL145411,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aerosols', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Bacillus (bacterium)', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dose', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Granuloma', 'Harvest', 'Heterozygote', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inbred Strain', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lung', 'Malaria', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Serum Proteins', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Vehicle crash', 'base', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning algorithm', 'model development', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein biomarkers', 'public health intervention', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'survival outcome', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tuberculosis diagnostics']",NHLBI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON,R01,2019,617451,0.2880848620782026
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9654700,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferons', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'random forest', 'research clinical testing', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,715056,0.4340737762955728
"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management by enabling personalized diagnosis of LTBI and the stratification of individuals with the highest potential for reactivation.",Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection,9819449,R01AI141591,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Regimen', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Silicon', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translations', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis', 'Whole Blood', 'antigen challenge', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'cytokine', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'high risk', 'immune function', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'latent infection', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,754111,0.410442450837308
"New approaches to optimizing the application and measuring the impact of community-based tuberculosis interventions PROJECT SUMMARY Globally, tuberculosis (TB) kills more people each year than any other infectious disease, but around 40% of TB cases go undiagnosed each year. This leads to continued transmission and a slow rate of decline in global TB incidence. Community-based TB screening interventions are one strategy for increasing the early diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis. Knowledge is lacking on when community-based TB screening interventions are likely to be fruitful and on the impact of these interventions on TB transmission. This study addresses the first of these knowledge gaps by identifying epidemiologic signals that predict high yields for community-based TB screening, and by assessing barriers to optimal implementation of community-based screening programs. It addresses the second knowledge gap by measuring transmission within communities that receive TB screening interventions, and by identifying potential sites of transmission both within and outside the community. Aim 1 applies random forest regression to data from a community-based screening program to create a decision tree that uses information about past TB patients to predict whether a commnity is likely to have high levels of undiagnosed TB in the present. Aim 2 is a mixed-methods study focusing on people who were missed by TB screening interventions, which will help understand the barriers to successful implementation. Aim 3 uses whole-genome sequencing of clinical isolates to determine the proportion of TB cases attributable to recent transmission within intervention communities, using this metric to evaluate the impact of screening interventions on transmission. Aim 4 uses social network analysis to identify sites of transmission within and outside intervention communities. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce global TB morbidity through improved community-based screening. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study seeks to understand (a) when community-based tuberculosis screening interventions are likely to be fruitful and (b) the impact these interventions have on tuberculosis transmission. This knowledge will improve community-based tuberculosis screening interventions and thus contribute to the reduction of global tuberculosis morbidity.",New approaches to optimizing the application and measuring the impact of community-based tuberculosis interventions,9781984,DP2MD015102,"['Address', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epidemiology', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Network', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical sequencing', 'community intervention', 'improved', 'novel strategies', 'random forest', 'screening', 'screening program', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIMHD,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,DP2,2019,2353629,0.3414984642524415
"Quantitative diagnosis of TB/HIV co-infection using pathogen-specific exosomes in blood ABSTRACT Patients co-infected with HIV and tuberculosis (TB) exhibit accelerated progression of both diseases. A missed TB diagnosis in a HIV-positive patient, and vice versa, can have severe consequences, since mortality rates are very high in HIV/TB co-infected patients. The World Health Organization thus recommends HIV testing for TB patients and TB screening for HIV-affected patients. Early diagnosis of HIV/TB co-infections and appropriately timed interventions can improve health outcomes by slowing disease progression and reducing mortality and the spread of these infections. Given this urgent need for early diagnosis of HIV and TB, we propose to develop and validate a novel assay that rapidly and directly diagnoses both HIV and TB infections, using a sensitive nanoplasmon-enhanced scattering (nPES) platform to detect pathogen-specific (Ps) exosomes (PsExo) that carry TB- and/or HIV-derived antigens in patient serum samples. Ps antigens are often difficult to detect in circulation, due to low concentrations and potential masking by non-specific protein interactions or degradative enzymes, especially early in infection when antigen concentrations are low. Body fluids are rich in exosomes, and exosomes are rich sources of multiple Ps-antigens. Exosome enrichment effectively concentrates Ps- antigens and protects them from circulating hydrolases, thereby enhancing and improving detection. While use of PsExo as biomarkers for diagnosing specific infectious diseases is new and shows great promise, significant technical challenges, including the current lack of validated PxExo markers for specific diseases and simple and rapid assays for PsExo analysis, exist. We have recently demonstrated that we can use our nPES assay platform to quantify cancer-derived exosomes and diagnose early-stage pancreatic tumors from disease controls. We will adapt this approach to detect HIV and TB PsExo in this proposal. Aim 1 will address the first issue by identifying pathogenic proteins specifically or predominantly expressed on exosomes of infected cells and evaluating PsExo candidates by quantitative proteomics analysis of infected patients from Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) sample bank. Aim 2 will establish an optimized nPES array using Aim 1 PsExo biomarkers, apply machine learning to develop an nPES array that can effectively diagnose HIV, TB and HIV/TB patients based on nPES results, and validate these findings in an independent FIND cohort. This approach does not require a separate exosome isolation step and uses only microsample serum volumes. The proposed assay will benefit co-infected patients who are unable to produce sputum, extrapulmonary TB patients who often require invasive biopsies for diagnosis, and patients with acute HIV infections who are still HIV antibody negative. Project Narrative Tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading cause of HIV-related mortality, accounting for one in three HIV deaths, while HIV infection has contributed to a significant increase in the worldwide incidence of TB. Successful development and validation of PsExo-nPES arrays described in this proposal will improve diagnosis of HIV and TB co-infections in vulnerable and diagnostically challenging populations.

The main objective of this proposal is to expedite the TB diagnosis process by developing novel image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images thus reducing patient wait times for being diagnosed with TB. The study will be conducted in the district of Carabayllo, a densely occupied, high-burden TB area in Lima, the capital of Perú. Efforts to develop the proposed user-centered, mobile device-based computing system are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and its strategic goals 2 and 4 in particular-the proposed socio-technical intervention aims at developing biomedical imaging techniques (i.e. wireless and image sensing/analyzing) to enable a point-of-care mobile device-based computing system for TB screening and diagnostic. Anticipated outcomes include a) a large-scale, real-world, well-annotated, and public available chest X-ray image database for TB screening, b) development of new image analysis techniques for X-ray image capturing and pre- processing, and c) novel learning-based feature extraction and classification algorithms. This  interdisciplinary effort, involving community, university, hospitals and health care establishments in all stages of the research, responds to the need for increased partnerships between academia and community stakeholders, and the potential for building capacity in biomedical and technology solutions for health in both directions (North-South, South-North). Its scientific contribution lies in the intersection of three NIBIB scientific program areas including image processing, telehealth, and biomedical informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public and global health because it offers a socio-technical solution for resource-poor communities severely affected by TB. Outcomes of this project will contribute significantly to improving specific healthcare processes affecting hard-to-reach communities that are socially excluded and lack the benefits of technological advances while broadening our understanding about effective human centered designs to improve healthcare systems with mobile computing technologies.",SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies,9525950,R01EB021900,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Capital', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discipline', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peru', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'Underrepresented Students', 'University Hospitals', 'Vaccines', 'Wait Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'Woman', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical practice', 'compliance behavior', 'data exchange', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'disadvantaged population', 'disease transmission', 'global health', 'handheld mobile device', 'image processing', 'improved', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'point of care', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'social', 'social inequality', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'tuberculosis diagnostics']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2018,333515,0.3811388030809886
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9501395,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,798023,0.4340737762955728

"Identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis combining cheminformatics,     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are witnessing the growing menace of both increasing cases of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains and the challenge to produce the first new tuberculosis (TB) drug in well over 40 years. The TB community, having invested in extensive high-throughput screening efforts, is faced with the question of how to optimally leverage this data in order to move from a hit to a lead to a clinical candidate and potentially a new drug. Complementing this approach, yet conducted on a much smaller scale, cheminformatic techniques have been leveraged. We suggest these computational approaches should be more optimally integrated in a workflow with experimental approaches to accelerate TB drug discovery. This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project entitled ""Identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis combining cheminformatics, diverse databases and logic-based pathway analysis"" describes the development of software that will facilitate new drug discovery efforts for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and the progression of molecules discovered with it as mimics for substrates of enzymes and their in vivo essential genes. In phase 1 we illustrated the concept of loosely marrying the cheminformatic and pathways database that resulted in two compounds as proposed mimics of 2 D-fructose 1,6 bisphosphate with activity against Mtb (MIC 20 and 40mg/ml). In phase II via an API we will link the knowledge in CDD, SRI and other databases and tools seamlessly. A researcher will be able to investigate molecules, targets, pathways and then select metabolites or other molecules for pharmacophore analysis, scoring with TB machine learning models and ADME and drug-likeness assessment from within one interface. This tool will be used to aid the identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis and be useful for hypotheses testing, knowledge sharing, data archiving, data mining and drug discovery. We will make CDD into a mobile application such that the generalized workflow in this project can be performed anywhere. We present promising preliminary work which resulted in two active compounds, that suggests phase II support of the mimic strategy to identify compounds of interest for TB would be a viable strategy. This proposal balances software development, database development and drug discovery activities in order to achieve our goals. We expect this product could be quickly applied to other infectious diseases which have a great societal impact and as a stretch goal we will endeavor to demonstrate this.          We propose to develop an integrated system to facilitate new drug discovery efforts for TB using novel logical inference techniques developed by scientists at SRI International, linked with knowledge which has been assembled by the curation of diverse biological data types and computational prediction by Collaborative Drug Discovery (CDD). This tool will be used to aid the identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis by combining cheminformatics, diverse databases and logic-based pathway analysis.

"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups. The hidden group models and metrics will be embedded in analysis methods, and then evaluated by TB experts. The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.          n/a",Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data,7805478,R01LM009731,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Boxing', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Gender', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guadeloupe', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phylogeny', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Restriction fragment length polymorphism', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder control', 'family genetics', 'fight against', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'global health', 'improved', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health research', 'relational database', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NLM,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2010,339537,0.43452653970517685

The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.          n/a",Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data,7901729,R01LM009731,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Boxing', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Gender', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guadeloupe', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phylogeny', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Restriction fragment length polymorphism', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder control', 'family genetics', 'fight against', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health research', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NLM,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2009,170789,0.43452653970517685
"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups.
