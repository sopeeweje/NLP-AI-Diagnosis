"DESCRIPTION:  The overall objective of the proposed research is to
 determine  the mechanisms responsible for the thermally induced changes
 that occur in the  coefficients of thermal expansion of dental porcelains
 as a result of multiple firings, slow cooling and post-soldering
 operations.  These changes in  porcelain thermal expansion are
 detrimental and produce cracks in porcelain  fused to metal restorations
 (PFM) either shortly after firing or sometime  later.  Either event
 causes additional costs and possibly additional trauma to  the patient.
 There are six Specific Aims.  The first is to explain the  thermal
 expansion behavior of porcelains on the basis of leucite and sanidine
 volume fractions, microcrack densities, an leucite particle surface
 areas.  The second is to determine the effect of localized cooling rate
 differences on  the thermal instability of dental porcelain during
 multiple firing, cooling,  and isothermal anneals.  The third is to
 determine the role of H2O as a glass  modifier in dental porcelain and
 specifically in the crystallization of  leucite and sanidine.  The fourth
 is to develop firing schedules for various  porcelain-metal systems to
 minimize the thermally induced microstructural  changes that lead to
 thermal expansion changes.The fifth is to modify porcelains to render
 them more resistant to thermal expansion changes.  The  sixth to develop
 a prototype expert system computer program for solving  thermal expansion
 mismatch problems. Techniques used in pursuit of these aims  include
 quantitative X-Ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with  energy
 dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, quantitative stereology, and conventional
 and laser dilatometry.

"DESCRIPTION:(Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract) The goal of this

and occupational cohorts.  More specifically, the aims of this study are to:    
(1) determine the feasibility of utilizing statewide cancer surveillance        
systems in the evaluation of cancer incidence within occupational cohorts;      
(2) compare and contrast the relative merits of standardized incidence          
ratios (SIR) with standardized mortality ratios (SMR) as determined from        
cancer surveillance systems incidence data and death certificate mortality

SMR and SIR estimates will be calculated and compared for three occupational    
cohorts (e.g., Highway Maintenance, 3M, Conwed).  SMR analyses have already     
been completed for the Highway Maintenance and 3M cohorts; a mortality          
update and SMR analysis will be conducted for the Conwed cohort (1988-1995).    
Cancer morbidity information, for the SIR analysis, will be determined by       
linking the three cohorts with the Minnesota Cancer Surveillance System         
(MCSS).  Residency status will be required before person-years can be           
calculated, however, because inclusion in the MCSS is restricted to             
Minnesota residents.  Linkages to other data sets will be used to determine     
the Minnesota residency status.  Sensitivity analyses will be used to           
evaluate confounding and follow-up bias.  Standardized mortality ratios will    
be compared to standardized incidence ratios for the Highway Maintenance,

"The amino acid sequence of a protein uniquely determines its tertiary

This proposal describes a strategy to identify the location of alpha-           
helices and beta-strands throughout the sequence. A method for using off-       
lattice simulations of a polypeptide chain to identify secondary structure      
preferences in the ensemble average is proposed. Once secondary structure       
is located, computational methods exist for generating plausible tertiary

GTPases for the relevant G-protein coupled receptors, G-beta-gamma and          
downstream effectors. We plan to continue to develop a genetic algorithm        
for the construction of polypeptide loops subject to a series of

The goal of this five year research is to provide new knowledge on:  1) the

adolescents, and 2) the most cost-effective and cost-beneficial                 
family-focused prevention interventions.  The research aims of this             
randomized clinical trial involving over 800 at-risk Washington, D.C.-area      
families of 7 to 11 year olds in components of the 16 week Strengthening        
Families Program (SFP) are:  1) to test the differential efficacy of the        
three major components of SFP-parent training (PT), children's skills           
training (CT), and family skills training (FT) compared to a minimal contact    
control (MT) on precursors and substance use/abuse employing a 2 x 4            
experimental design; 2) to estimate the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness     
of the SFP components with 400 African American families and 400 White          
families; and 3) to empirically test several competing etiological and          
intervention theories of drug use/abuse underlying the intervention design      
by analyzing the survey research data from 1,600 12 to 19 year olds and the     
800 intervention families using structural equation modeling, mediational       
analysis, hierarchical linear modeling, latent growth modeling, and             
transactional modeling (cross-lagged SEM, artificial intelligence, and          
neural network simulations) for gender, race, and other sub-groups.  The        
rationale for the component design is that a major question exists              
concerning the efficacy of child-only interventions that group high-risk        
children together as well as the added benefit of working with the family       
together compared to parent-training only.  Demonstrating the importance of     
involving parents and working with families would be very valuable              
information for prevention providers.  Additional co-variate outcome            
analyses will be conducted to answer practical questions conceming the          
efficacy of the four interventions for different subgroups of clients.  A       
strong process evaluation including a management information system (MIS)

Families Program (SFP) are:  1) to test the differential efficacy of the        
three major components of SFP-parent training (PT), children's skills           
training (CT), and family skills training (FT) compared to a minimal contact    
control (MT) on precursors and substance use/abuse employing a 2 x 4            
experimental design; 2) to estimate the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness     
of the SFP components with 400 African American families and 400 White          
families; and 3) to empirically test several competing etiological and          
intervention theories of drug use/abuse underlying the intervention design      
by analyzing the survey research data from 1,600 12 to 19 year olds and the     
800 intervention families using structural equation modeling, mediational       
analysis, hierarchical linear modeling, latent growth modeling, and             
transactional modeling (cross-lagged SEM, artificial intelligence, and          
neural network simulations) for gender, race, and other sub-groups.  The        
rationale for the component design is that a major question exists              
concerning the efficacy of child-only interventions that group high-risk        
children together as well as the added benefit of working with the family       
together compared to parent-training only.  Demonstrating the importance of     
involving parents and working with families would be very valuable              
information for prevention providers.  Additional co-variate outcome            
analyses will be conducted to answer practical questions conceming the          
efficacy of the four interventions for different subgroups of clients.  A       
strong process evaluation including a management information system (MIS)       
conducted by University of Maryland researchers wili document implementation    
process and provide feedback to improve implementation fidelity.  Additional    
health services sub-aim questions will be addressed through analyses of         
recruitment, attrition, consumer satisfaction, participation variables, and     
client and trainer characteristics linked to outcomes.  Seven nationally        
recognized consultants have agreed to support the culturally-specific           
program development, implementation, and data analyses.
