"Efforts to apply computer methods to assess and improve the quality of          
care in the hospital have been stymied by limited access to clinical            
data.  Free-text data have detailed clinical descriptions of patients           
that would be useful in computer altering systems and computer reminder         
systems.  However, free-text data cannot be interpreted by most clinical        
computer systems.  In this proposal, we describe research specifically          
aimed at making free-text data accessible to computer-based applications        
for assessing and improving the quality of care.  In particular the             
research plan focuses on the development of technologies that would allow       
free-text data to be used in clinical alert systems for critical test           
results; in reminder systems to encourage adherence to practice                 
guidelines; and in data collection systems for severity of illness models       
applied in the assessment of risk adjusted outcomes.  The approach              
described in the research plan emphasizes the development of statistical        
and probabilistic methods for interpretation of data derived from medical       
language processing systems.  We will test the methods developed for

radiological follow-up; 3) and the automatic assessment of

"DESCRIPTION:  Computing with biochemical reactions is increasingly important    
in studying genomes, assessing toxicity, and developing therapeutics.  There    
are several important information sources, but their data are rudimentary       
and often inaccurate.  Incorporation of biochemical information into            
databases is extremely slow compared to that of sequence and structural         
information, and will lag further as large-scale surveys of gene expression     
and other reactions accelerate over the next few years.  Mechanisms for         
review exist, but are manual, paper-dependent, and can be delayed for a year    
or more.                                                                        
                                                                                
As curators and coordinators of biochemical information sources, the            
applicants share a number of problems in the collection and review of           
information.  Moreover, they are mutually dependent for the means to do so:     
compound information is critical in checking reaction data, reaction            
information is needed to spot errors in compound information, and the           
automatic verification algorithms for either are closely related and need       
both.  The applicants, therefore, propose to build a curatorial exchange for    
the deposit and review of biochemical information by the scientific             
community.  The applicants' goal is to demonstrate a system that will           
encourage the mandating of deposit while ensuring that the information is of    
the highest quality.                                                            
                                                                                
The role of the exchange is to receive deposits, check and classify their       
biochemical information automatically, forward them to panels of human          
reviewers for vetting, and publish the information by release to the            
participating data sources--all over the World-Wide Web. It will track the      
origin and status of deposits and reviews, serve computations for the           
relevant pattern matching and simulation, and maintain an archival copy of      
data.  The databases remain independent, and separately provide additional      
information.  Algorithm development and testing depends on an adequate          
information infrastructure, so the applicants will complete a basic data set    
of compounds and reactions.  They will use this experience to develop a more    
comprehensive domain model that better captures modern biochemistry, and        
implement it for deposit and review.  Since the basic data and algorithms       
will be valuable to the community at large, they plan to serve these to the     
World-Wide Web. the exchange and its underlying data form the infrastructure    
necessary for sustainable, cost-effective development of biochemical
