"A significant fraction of all courses of external-beam radiotherapy have        
unplanned interruptions, i.e. scheduled treatments are missed. Because of       
the kinetics of cellular damage repair and tumor repopulation, designing        
extra or augmented treatments to compensate for the missed fractions is         
non-trivial. Since some individualized compensation regimen must be             
chosen, it should be rationalized using state-of-the-art radiobiology.  In      
Phase I we wrote prototype software (RIC, the Radiotherapy Interruption         
Compensator) which produces a range of practical options for the                
radiotherapist to compensate for unplanned interruptions during an              
extended radiotherapy regimen. It calculates what doses are needed to           
produce equal tumor control (or, alternately, equal late normal-tissue          
complications) when a proposed interruption-compensated regimen is              
substituted for the originally planned protocol. The program is designed        
as an ""expert system"", making available to any practicing radiotherapist        
the expertise of leading practitioners, in a personal-computer based,           
user-friendly package.                                                          
                                                                                
Having demonstrated feasibility, we propose, in this Phase II application,      
to continue the research effort initiated in Phase I. The goal is to            
produce, at the end of the Phase II period, a marketable product which is       
a) scientifically state-of-the-art, b) designed and written with                
appropriate quality control, c) robust to use, d) credible to practicing

"The transport system of the corneal endothelium maintains the cornea at
