"We propose a low-cost commercial intelligent hypermedia information system
to educate patients and the general public about breast cancer. User
centered system design, focusing on seeing the domain from the patient's
or potential patient's point of view, is central to our approach.

The need for breast cancer education evident. About 182 thousand women
will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year in the United States alone.
Patients-and the general public-want information. Doctors and nurses are
pressed for time, and for any number of reasons may not be able to provide
all of the information an individual may want or need.

One technological innovation in our proposal is the application of user-
centered system design to a commercially available medical information
system. A second is the use of cognitive models of patients' understanding
and perceived information needs regarding breast cancer and its treatments
to develop the deep structure of the interface between the medical model
and the user.

"The goal of this research is to develop improved assessment protocols           
that afford a quantitative and analytic evaluation of speech impairment         
in children and adults with neurological disorders.  Speech impairments         
(dysarthrias) will be studied in persons with amyotrophic lateral               
sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke, cerebellar degeneration, cerebral       
palsy, and developmental speech disorders.  Improved evaluation of speech       
intelligibility is a particular focus of this work, but issues of speech        
and voice quality also are addressed.  The methods to be used are a             
combination of standard clinical assessments (such as rating scales),           
intelligibility evaluations, and computer-based acoustic analyses.              
Specifically, the methods include: perceptual ratings of speech by              
experienced clinicians, quantitative assessment of intelligibility, a           
multiple-parameter acoustic analysis, computer correction of speech             
abnormalities through LPC resynthesis of the acoustic signal, and               
derivation of vocal tract shape from acoustic parameters.  Work in all          
these areas will be based on recordings of speech samples from a large

be a library of clinical profiles including intelligibility scores,

"There is growing recognition that, while practice guidelines can                
predispose physicians to behavioral change, even the most respected and         
clinically relevant guidelines often do not affect actual practice.             
Despite the apparent reluctance of physicians to incorporate published          
practice guidelines into their clinical routine, there are signs that           
immediate automated reminders can have a profound influence on physician        
behavior, and on the cost and quality of medical care. As practice              
guidelines proliferate and become more complex, the dilemma facing those        
who design practice guidelines is the tradeoff between the                      
comprehensiveness of the guidelines and the likelihood they will be             
retained and implemented by the physicians for whom they are intended.          
This same complexity can complicate computer-based implementation of            
guidelines. For example, the dependence of guidelines on patient                
preferences and individual risk factors makes the rule-based approach           
impractical for many guidelines.                                                
                                                                                
Intelligent decision systems (IDS) are specifically designed to implement       
complex, flexible guidelines tailored to varying clinical circumstances.        
These systems provide advice based on a tailored decision-analytic model.       
But these systems assume that a physician-user will be persuaded by a           
review of the decision model and its associated quantitative results.           
                                                                                
The goal of this work is to develop and test improved explanation methods       
for quantitative decision models so that intelligent decision systems can       
be used in a consultative mode. We have developed a program called QxQ,         
which uses symbolic reasoning to provide qualitative text explanations for      
the results of decision trees. This work is intended to extract the key         
architecture- and domain-independent elements of QxQ's methodology, and to      
reimplement and test them as part of MIDAS, an existing IDS. First, we          
will develop a domain- and system-independent version of QxQ, called EQxQ       
(for essential QxQ), by applying it to decision models constructed in           
MIDAS. In collaboration with the developers of MIDAS, we will identify the      
key independent elements necessary to generate explanations from an IDS.        
Second, we will devise and implement additional explanation methods in          
EQxQ to allow explanation of complex modeling constructs, such as Markov        
models, cycle trees, and cost-effectiveness models. Third, we will test         
the robustness of the MIDAS-EQxQ system by using it to implement a              
decision model underlying a clinically relevant practice guideline.             
Finally, we will establish and pilot test the routine use of the program        
in an outpatient clinic. We will survey the physician-users to determine        
the strengths and weaknesses of the program. Using pilot data from the          
program's routine use, we will design a prospective clinical evaluation of      
the system and its explanations by measuring their effect on patient            
outcome. Our study will provide data regarding the clinical utility of

"The proposed research aims to: a) Improve the understanding of the              
genetics of inherited diseases with unclear modes of transmission.              
Studies will evaluate the effectiveness of current methods of analysis,         
including classical linkage analysis, sib-pair or affected-pedigree-            
member analysis and the use of measures of association in understanding         
the underlying genetic mechanisms of such traits.  Simulation studies           
will continue to provide a source of family data reflecting confounding         
factors thought to be a problem in linkage analysis of certain complex          
traits, such as psychiatric or behavioral disorders.  Factors to be             
considered include assortative mating, genetic heterogeneity and multi-         
locus disease determination.  The ability of current methods to                 
correctly analyze traits with one or more of these factors will be              
assessed and, where appropriate, alternative methods will be developed          
and tested.  b) Apply techniques of neural network pattern matching to          
problems of genetic systems.  Applications include: aid in phenotype            
definition for traits with multiple clinical problems of genetic                
systems.  Applications include: aid in phenotype definition for traits          
with multiple clinical characteristics; determination of risk of disease        
based on phenotype, known risk factors and disease profiles in                  
relatives; determination of organ transplant success based on HLA               
antigen matching patterns; definition of disease phenotype based on             
quantitative factors.  c) Develop and apply strategies for ordering             
multiple linked loci using pairwise recombination data, radiation hybrid        
data, or other physical mapping data.  Some of these ordering strategies        
may be adaptable to the development of techniques for integrating map           
information obtained by different methods, an important step in                 
organizing a comprehensive, reliable map.  d) Carry out classical               
linkage analysis for specific genetic diseases.  Currently, a genome            
scan is underway to identify a gene or genes for polycystic liver               
disease.  Other diseases to be studied include lymphoma and prostate            
cancer. Methods to be tested in the simulation studies can be applied           
to these analyses in order to better understand the complete genetic            
picture, including identification of heterogeneity, by detecting linkage        
of different disease forms to different marker loci. Such                       
differentiation will help sharpen the clinical definition of various            
forms of the diseases.                                                          
                                                                                
As a result of advances from this work, better mathematical tools for           
the study of diseases with complex or ill-defined inheritance patterns          
will be available.  Applications to specific diseases will increase             
understanding of interactions between clinical definition and                   
predisposing genetic factors.  This will increase the precision of              
genetic counseling and suggest useful approaches for studying the

and tested.  b) Apply techniques of neural network pattern matching to          
problems of genetic systems.  Applications include: aid in phenotype            
definition for traits with multiple clinical problems of genetic                
systems.  Applications include: aid in phenotype definition for traits          
with multiple clinical characteristics; determination of risk of disease        
based on phenotype, known risk factors and disease profiles in                  
relatives; determination of organ transplant success based on HLA               
antigen matching patterns; definition of disease phenotype based on             
quantitative factors.  c) Develop and apply strategies for ordering             
multiple linked loci using pairwise recombination data, radiation hybrid        
data, or other physical mapping data.  Some of these ordering strategies        
may be adaptable to the development of techniques for integrating map           
information obtained by different methods, an important step in                 
organizing a comprehensive, reliable map.  d) Carry out classical               
linkage analysis for specific genetic diseases.  Currently, a genome            
scan is underway to identify a gene or genes for polycystic liver               
disease.  Other diseases to be studied include lymphoma and prostate            
cancer. Methods to be tested in the simulation studies can be applied           
to these analyses in order to better understand the complete genetic            
picture, including identification of heterogeneity, by detecting linkage        
of different disease forms to different marker loci. Such                       
differentiation will help sharpen the clinical definition of various            
forms of the diseases.                                                          
                                                                                
As a result of advances from this work, better mathematical tools for           
the study of diseases with complex or ill-defined inheritance patterns          
will be available.  Applications to specific diseases will increase             
understanding of interactions between clinical definition and                   
predisposing genetic factors.  This will increase the precision of              
genetic counseling and suggest useful approaches for studying the               
mechanisms involved in determining disease state.
