"The Heart Failure Program project is a resource-related research program to     
develop new reasoning methods for the application of Artifical Intelligence     
techniques to medicine for the effort of the SUMEX-AIM community.  The          
context and driving force for this research is the management of heart          
failure in the intensive care setting.  We will:  1) Develop a                  
representational methodology capable of supporting the clinically relevant      
distinctions of patient state.  This representation will utilize the            
clinically significant qualitative parameter values and will include causal     
relationships, time dependencies and relations about change.  2) Build a        
qualitative physiological model of the cardiovascular system using this         
methodology to act as a store for evolving knowledge of patient state.  3)      
Explore and develop strategies for determining the appropriate parameter        
values in the model from input data, reasoning support methods and              
heuristics for carrying out the diagnostic reasoning with the model, and        
reasoning support methods and heuristics for carrying out the diagnostic        
reasoning with the model, and reasoning support methods and heuristics for      
finding possible therapies and determining their potential consequences.        
4) Build around this core a program to assist the physician in exploring        
his or her understanding of the implications in an individual case.  The        
physician and program will reason together about the case with the

"The elderly population is one of the fastest growing segments of the            
American population. Nevertheless, there is a shortage of clinicians who

advancing age.  As a result, predictable deteriorations in renal function,      
increasing drug-utilization over time and susceptibility to age-related

Geriatric Service of MediSource is a comprehensive computerized product

electronic data is used for clinical patient care and contains a potential      
4000 variables per record.  This volume of data requires new approaches for     
data analysis and medical decision support, since human information

"Our long-range objective is to understand the functional organization

fundamental building blocks, from which larger functional units are             
constructed.  The cortex is thus viewed as a crystal (a more or less

cats, and simultaneously record electrical responses from small neuronal        
clusters and local field potentials.  We shall thus obtain a spatio-            
temporal picture of the activity in the neural ensembles which encode

We address three major aims: 1) To test the modularity hypothesis we            
shall measure, in a large piece of cortical tissue, the full range of           
functional maps ( for orientation, color, spatial frequency etc.)               
together with the retinotopic map.  We shall measure the periodicity of,        
and correlations among, the functional maps, to determine if they are           
commensurate.  This will lead to a refined framework that could include         
possibly incommensurate cortical scales and interactions among cortical         
elements.  2) We shall investigate how the Principal Components                 
(eigenfunctions) obtained from the optical images depend on the extent          
of the visual stimulus, to determine how the dynamical dimension of the         
primary visual cortex (viewed as a dynamical system) scales with size.          
3) We shall study the concerted electrical responses of neuronal                
clusters, to clarify the link between optical signals and neuronal              
activity, and to deepen our understanding of the neuronal dynamics.

with the way in which the fundamental modalities of the visual world
