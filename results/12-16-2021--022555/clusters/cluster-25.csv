"The first project objective is directed to developing a comprehensive           
computer interactive neuropsychologic test battery that is sensitive for        
detecting subtle disturbances of cerebral integrity.  This task will be         
accomplished accessing a panel of neuropsychologists, an expert systems         
specialist and a software architect.  Next, standardization will be             
conducted on 500 normal adolescents and adults.  This sample will be            
stratified by age and gender and demographically representative of the          
population.  Concurrent to these activities, an expert system will be           
created.  This latter task will enable dissemination of the final               
protocol to the widest possible user audience.  Finally, the interactive        
test battery will be used to ascertain the prevalence, types and severity       
of neuropsychologic deficit in samples of adolescent and adult drug

The ultimate goal of this research program is to devise a standardized,         
quantitative and comprehensive method for characterizing the cognitive

testing, because of its precision in measurement, will enable the               
detection of subtle or occult impairment residual to chronic drug abuse.        
For this reason, the battery is to be created specifically for this

"Therapeutic management based on protocols, and clinical algorithms is
 increasing in significance as medicine tackles more serious illnesses and
 must do so in cost-efficient manner. Clinical algorithms are appealing as
 they provide a good overview of the clinical state of a patient, identify
 key decisions and the outcomes associated with those decisions. They
 provide guidance and improve the quality of care without taking the
 control away from the physicians. Despite these advantages clinical
 algorithm design, specification, and delivery remain problematic. This
 research proposal seeks to overcome these difficulties, while retaining
 the advantages of clinical algorithms.
 
 We propose to develop a general framework for the representation for
 clinical algorithms and supporting medical knowledge, to communicate these
 algorithms effectively by extracting and presenting protocols specific
 individual patient's condition, and to provide decision aids for protocol-
 based patient care. This framework will use knowledge about therapy in the
 context of specific conditions to create patient-specific algorithms
 refined from the general-purpose algorithms. Aspects not pertinent to the
 case will be removed. The derivation of the specialized algorithms from
 the general algorithm will be recorded and used to explain the logic of
 the specialized algorithms. Because the algorithms will be tailored to the
 patient context, they will be detailed, yet manageable. This will avoid
 the over-simplifications of current ""one-size-fits-all"" algorithm. Mixed
 graphic and textual presentation techniques will be used to develop a
 user-friendly interface with explanation facilities integrated with
 patient information systems. We will test the framework by developing
 operational systems for hemodynamic resuscitation and management of
 circulatory shock in critically ill postoperative patients.
 
 We have chosen the domain of the management of circulatory failure in
 critically ill postoperative patients because: (a) circulatory failure is
 the significant medical problem affecting many postoperative patients
 where proper management can mean the difference between life and death,
 (b) we have a long track record of on-going activities in development of
 objective treatment methodologies in this area, (c) we have developed and
 tested a general clinical algorithm for management of high risk
 postoperative surgical patients, (d) our recent attempts to extend and
 refine the initial algorithm using traditional approaches have been
 frustrated by the complexity of the task. The proposed framework will
 support the creation of detailed therapeutic management algorithms and
 decision support systems to implement these algorithms in daily practice.

"Neural network optimization algorithms greatly enhance our ability to           
construct large-scale, dynamical models of highly interconnected networks.      
Until now, optimization has only been applied to networks of simplistic         
processing units, ignoring the integrative and temporal response                
properties of single neurons, thus limiting the predictive power of the         
models.  The long-term goal of this project is to develop a hybrid              
modeling strategy in which optimization methods are applied to networks of      
realistic,multicompartmental model neurons. To accomplish this goal, we         
will construct a hybrid model of an actual distributed processing network       
composed of repeatably identifiable sensory, motor, and interneurons that       
computes a well-defined behavioral input-output function. Optimization          
will be used to predict the connectivity of as-yet-unidentified                 
interneurons in the actual network and the predictions will be tested by        
identifying the interneurons by physiological and morphological means.          
Performance of the hybrid model will be assessed by comparing it to the         
performance of an a priori model in which all connection strengths are          
determined physiologically. The final model will be used to predict the         
loci of synaptic plasticity underlying nonassociative conditioning of the       
reflex by incorporating local learning rules and by optimization methods.       
The predictions will be tested by determining the actual plastic sites

the predictive power of optimized network models and illuminating the

"DESCRIPTION:  Limitations of many disabled individuals' production efficiency, communication rate and vocabulary organization impact negatively on their ability to communicate competently using present-day Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices.  This project proposes a re-conceptualization in the way language units are organized and retrieved in present-day AAC technologies, by operationalizing recent linguistic research in frame theory.  A frame-based organization for utterances is proposed by exploiting natural category systems found in the context, culture and conceptual structures of the individual.  A method and system for implementing these knowledge structures on a computer system will be developed. Specifically, the purpose of Phase l of this project is to provide a proof of concept for the Frametalker technology design.  During the course of the year we will a) develop a software prototype of the Frametalker, b) integrate it with a database of communication frame-structured utterances and c) submit Frametalker to laboratory and field-testing.  artificial intelligence; biomedical equipment development; clinical biomedical equipment; communication disorder aid; computer program /software; computer system design /evaluation; language; speech synthesizers; vocabulary FRAMETALKER--AN UTTERANCE BASED AUGMENTATIVE DEVICE","DESCRIPTION:  Limitations of many disabled individuals' production efficiency, communication rate and vocabulary organization impact negatively on their ability to communicate competently using present-day Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices.

"The brain is at risk of serious cerebrovascular insult during the
