  EXPERT SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATED SLEEP STAGE SCORING,,2272263,R43NS033437,['R43NS033437'],NS,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/2272263,R43,1995,98020,1.0
"The Family Planning Council of Southeastern Pennsylvania, in collaboration      
with the Cancer Prevention Research Center of the University of Rhode           
Island, is proposing an innovative study designed to address the risk           
behaviors associated with a recent alarming increase in the incidence of        
cervical neoplasias among young women. The proposed study is designed to        
develop, implement and evaluate interventions that increase consistent          
condom use and decrease cigarette smoking among 1,800 low income female         
youth aged 14-17 years who obtain family planning services at four diverse      
federally-funded family planning clinics. Smoking and unprotected sexual        
intercourse have been found to be independently associated with increased       
risks of cervical cancer in this population The proposed intervention is        
based on the Transtheoretical or Stages of Change model combined with one       
of the most promising modalities for reaching youth, an interactive             
computer based expert system whose efficacy will be evaluated alone and in      
combination with an adaptation of the anticipatory counseling model. Data       
will be collected at four points during a nine-month intervention period        
and at six-month intervals for 18 months post.intervention to assess            
effects over time. In addition, the intervention is aimed at increasing         
utilization of comprehensive, gynecologic health care including routine         
Pap smear screening, follow.up colposcopic examination and treatment of         
cervical dysplasia, the precursor of cervical cancers, when indicated.          
The proposed study represents the combined expertise of family planning         
researchers and service providers with considerable experience working          
with economically disadvantaged females and behavioral scientists with          
extensive research expertise in high risk behavior change.

"This proposal aims to develop an improved understanding of the mechanisms       
involved in functional MRI of the brain and to optimize imaging and data        
analysis strategies for the detection of neuronal activity.  Functional MRI     
relies on the ability to detect the changes in NMR signal that are produced     
in discrete regions of cortex in response to specific activating stimuli,       
and are believed to reflect changes in local blood flow, volume and             
oxygenation.  Functional MRI promises to be a major addition to the methods     
available for studying brain activation.  Despite the widespread claims for     
the power and successes of the method, there remain several unanswered          
questions regarding its optimal mode of use, the tissue and technical           
factors that are important in determining the signal changes detected, and      
the significance and interpretation of these signal changes.  The research      
proposed would systematically address such issues.  The underlying              
mechanism may include both susceptibility contrast effects, based on the        
BOLD effect, as well as wash-in effects, and these will be separately           
quantified.  The factors that affect each mechanism will be separately          
identified and measured.  For the BOLD effect, extensive computer modeling      
and measurements in phantoms and animals brains will be used to establish       
the relative sensitivity to vascular structures of different sizes,             
spacings and orientations, as well as other tissue properties such as the       
rate of water diffusion.  The separate sensitivities to s-called static         
field effects (T2*),  diffusive losses and other mechanisms will also be        
established.  The performance of different pulse sequences will be compared     
to devise optimal methods of scanning and detection at 1.5T.  Echo planar       
imaging, conventional gradient echo and fast spin echo imaging as well as       
more novel schemes will be compared in phantoms, animal brains and examples     
of human activation.  Human and animal activations will be produced in vivo     
using  visual and motor stimuli as well as by alteration of global blood        
flow by acetazolamide and hypercarbia.  A critical feature of current           
paradigms for detecting activation is the method of data analysis, which is     
interrelated with the nature of the task and imaging method used.  We will      
compare different methods of analyzing functional data sets, including          
statistical parameter mapping, time-correlation analyses, and principal         
component analysis.  The sensitivity of each to motion and other artifacts      
will be established by in in vivo comparisons and by computer simulations.

"This proposal is directed toward improving tomographic imaging in               
diagnostic radiology and nuclear medicine. It is predicated on the claim        
that significant advances will be achieved in the fidelity of the images        
that are reconstructed from the raw detector measurements of the                
tomographic scanner by changing the basic elements (called ""basis               
functions"") with which the image is built in the computer. The                  
conventional basic elements for computerized tomographic imaging are the        
voxel basis functions, and the sinusoidal basis functions of Fourier            
analysis. Two classes of promising new basis functions have been                
developed: functions that are localized in space (as are the voxel basis        
functions), and functions that are not localized (similar in many respects      
to sinusoids). The new classes of basis functions are well-suited to            
constructing faithful digital image representations of the biological           
structures that have influenced the raw tomographic scanner data. The new       
localized basis functions have a number of very desirable properties not        
shared by voxels: they are rotationally symmetric, their Fourier                
transforms are effectively localized, and they have continuous derivatives      
of any desired order.  The new non-localized basis functions are designed       
to perform a spatially-variant filtering operation that is required by a        
non-iterative method of 3D image reconstruction developed by the Principal      
Investigator.                                                                   
                                                                                
The specific aims are to develop mathematical theory, efficient computer        
algorithms, application-specific implementations and evaluation criteria        
for (1) methods of iterative reconstruction from projections, (2) methods       
of estimating the fundamental limits on the performance of the                  
reconstruction process, and (3) methods of non-iterative 3D reconstruction      
from projections. For specified imaging tasks, the level of statistical         
significance will be found for rejection of the null hypothesis that two        
methods perform a task equally well, in favor of the alternative                
hypothesis that one method performs the task better.

 DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract) The proposed research                                                                 
 has the goal of developing and validating interval psychometric scales of          
 visual function limitations and vision disabilities. These interval scales will    
 be developed using Rasch probablistic measurement models applied to ordinal        
 patient rating responses to individual questions. Once developed and validated,    
 these scales will be independent of the particular assessment used, as long as     
 the instrument is calibrated to the scale. The significance of the proposed        
 research is that it will provide a means of estimating measurements of latent      
 functional ability variables for individual patients with visual impairments.      
 In the future, these measurements can be used for parametric studies,              
 epidemiological studies, and clinical outcome studies. The proposed research       
 will identify the number and nature of functional ability scales. It will          
 determine the dependence of those scales on the diagnosis of visual system         
 disorder, the type of visual impairment, the existence of co-morbidities, and      
 the patient's history of rehabilitation. Existing visual function instruments      
 (NEI-VFQ, VF-14, ADVS, and VAQ) and two general function instrument's              
 individual items will be evaluated with respect to scales. To estimate the         
 scales, a large set of specific cognitive and motor activities (e.g., writing a    
 check) will be classified according to functional domain (reading, fine and        
 gross visual-motor, visual information processing [e.g., recognition,              
 localization, orientation], or mobility). In telephone interviews, low vision      
 patients will be asked to rate the difficulty of performing each activity.         
 Rasch analysis will be used to test the hypothesis that there is a global          
 functional ability scale and to test the validity of the a priori visual           
 function domains. Principal component analysis of response residuals will be       
 used to evaluate the dimensionality of visual function limitations. Patients       
 also will be asked to rate the difficulty of achieving specific activity goals     
 (e.g., cook a meal, manage personal finances) and Rasch analysis will be used      
 to estimate a vision disability scale. Item ordering and item intervals on the     
 scales and scale validity will be compared across diagnostic groups (AMD,          
 glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, RP, CVA, and anterior segment disorders) and       
 for different types of visual impairments (e.g., acuity loss and contracted        
 visual fields). Person measures of functional ability will be evaluated as a       
 function of severity of visual impairments (visual acuity, contrast                
 sensitivity, visual fields, dark adaptation, color vision). Determining if the     
 NEI-VFQ, VF-14, ADVS, VAQ, SF-36, and SIP can be calibrated to common scales
