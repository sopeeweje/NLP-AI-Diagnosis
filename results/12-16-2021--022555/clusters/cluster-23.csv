"New prosthetic methods are giving people with motor impairments
 alternative communication and control channels.  A logical culmination of
 these developments is a system that allows the brain to bypass completely
 its normal output pathways.  Recent studies from this laboratory have
 shown that humans, including those with motor disabilities, can learn to
 change rapidly and accurately the amplitude of the 8-12 Hz mu rhythm in
 the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded over sensorimotor cortex.
 Furthermore, they can use this control to move a cursor on a computer
 screen.  Good single-channel control has been obtained, and initial data
 indicate that multichannel control is also possible.  Thus, the mu
 rhythm, which recent work shows is detectable in nearly all adults, may
 support a multichannel brain-to-computer interface, and thereby provide a
 powerful new communication and control option for severely disabled
 individuals.
 
 This project's goal is a reliable multichannel brain-computer interface.
 The proposed approach is based on three well-supported hypotheses: that
 the scalp-recorded 8-12 Hz mu rhythm comprises a number of relatively
 independent components, that topographic analysis and frequency analysis
 techniques can distinguish between these components, and that humans can
 learn to control specific components and use them to operate a
 multichannel brain-computer interface.
 
 The first objective is to define by topography and frequency the separate
 8-12 Hz components that are present when individuals are using the
 current interface.  The second objective is to determine which components
 individuals are best able to control.  The third objective is to
 incorporate these trainable components into a multichannel brain-computer
 interface that is rapid and reliable.  These objectives will be achieved
 by combining online studies in which subjects learn to use the interface
 while extensive data are stored, and offline data analyses in which
 methods for improving the interface are defined.
 
 This project should produce an EEG-based brain-computer interface of
 significant value to individuals with disabilities.  It should also lead
 to further work exploring the practical capabilities and theoretical
 implications of this new form of communication.

"Efforts to apply computer methods to assess and improve the quality of

can be characterized and controlled through unstable periodic orbits, 2)        
hen noise driven will exhibit stochastic resonance, and 3) because of           
coupling will exhibit generalized (nonlinear) synchrony and emergence.          
Long-term goals are to achieve a better understanding of neuronal network       
and brain behavior, and to develop novel methods of treating dynamical          
diseases.                                                                       
                                                                                
The research project will involve theoretical work on the detection of          
unstable orbits in In Vitro brain slices and human epileptic foci.  Such        
orbit information forms a novel method of characterizing the deterministic      
properties of complex systems despite nonstationarity, and can be used to       
control those systems.  Nonlinear systems also optimize their response to       
weak signals in the presence of noise - stochastic resonance.  We will          
define the statistical mechanics of stochastic resonance through                
simultaneous measurements of single neuron and neuronal ensemble activity.      
Since neuronal ensembles may demonstrate nonlinear generalized synchrony,       
we will quantify spatio-temporal generalized synchrony through dual             
simultaneous single cell recordings as a function of separation in a            
neuronal network.  Both unstable orbit detection and generalized synchrony      
will be used to define the emergence of nonlinear behaviors in neuronal         
ensembles.                                                                      
                                                                                
The results of this research will fundamentally alter the way that neuronal     
dynamics can be characterized and controlled, will provide a means to deal      
with neuronal nonstationarity, will further explain the role of noise in
