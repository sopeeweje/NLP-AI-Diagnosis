"This grant proposal is focused on developing new mathematical and
 statistical models to describe biological systems. Models to represent,
 help to understand, predict future behavior, and control biological
 systems are becoming more and more important and of widespread use in
 different fields related to biology and health care. Complex mathematical
 models are needed to model the complicated interactions between the
 physiological functions of biological systems, and to model the effect of
 interventions (e.g. therapy) on these functions. The specific aims of this
 grant focus on three areas of research. 1. Develop and investigate
 statistical models for biological population data. Biological data are
 always collected from some population of different individuals, and are
 often highly variable. This is mostly due to variability of physiological
 functions between individuals, and to measurement error. Statistical
 models are needed to deal with the complex structure of population data. I
 will (I) introduce a general methodology based on the use of sophisticated
 heteroscedastic statistical models, which does not explicitly formulate a
 model for interindividual variability but promises to be fast, efficient
 and unbiased; and (ii) investigate the performance of existing population
 models using realistic simulations including model misspecification. 2.
 Develop semi-mechanistic compartmental models. I focus on three main
 problems: (i) the development and investigation a new general class of
 compartmental pharmacokinetics""'pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models, (ii) the
 development of semi-mechanistic black-box compartmental models to deal
 with non-linear PK systems, (iii) the development of the technology to
 apply well established semi-mechanistic linear black-box models to the
 purpose of PK control. 3. Develop new multivariate dynamic models. The
 main problem addressed is how to represent a system where multiple inputs
 (drugs) and multiple interrelated responses are measured. I propose
 different classes of models to do so based on spline networks and
 eventually neural networks. The proposed models can incorporate a
 compartmental sub-structure to easily deal with kinetics. Continuous and
 discrete time versions of the models are considered. The statistical and
 mathematical models introduced in the grant have widespread application to
 a variety of biological fields. However specific areas, directly linked to
 health care issues, are selected for active research and application of
 the proposed models. These areas correspond to experimental situations
 where the models proposed in the grant are particularly needed (nonlinear
 and multivariate dynamic), and represent continuations of already
 established collaborations with leading scientists. They include: computer
 control of ultra-short acting anaesthetic drugs administration,
 pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic of short-acting anesthetics,
 pharmacodynamic of nicotine and nicotine tolerance development, adenosine
 kinetics and metabolism and their relationship to adenosine
 pharmacodynamic effects, modeling of cardiovascular drugs effects on
 pharmacy dynamic responses (heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing
 variability) sampled at high rates.
