"Neural networks (NN) have become established as powerful tools for complex
pattern recognition problems. One application which appears well suited to
NN methods is the identification of prognostic groups, to be used for
treatment planning. For many cancer, studies of cancer cell biology have
added many factors of potential prognostic value, but the way in which
these interact with known factors is generally not well studied. The
potential of NNs to model these data in a non-linear fashion has only
begun to be explored.  NNs are not part of standard statistical packages,
making them relatively inaccessible to many statisticians. More
importantly, current NN methods cannot accommodate censored outcome
variables.

This proposal is for development of algorithms for censored-data NNs,
implementation of these within a comprehensive statistical package, and
evaluation of alternative approaches. The aim is to provide statisticians
involved with clinical decision making with more ready access to NN
technology, and with the means to analyze survival-type data. The value of
NNs in this field cannot be addressed by any single investigator, but by
providing the software that is needed, and some guidelines for its use, we
anticipate that research in this field will be stimulated.

"The goal of this research is to develop improved techniques, both fully         
automated and computer-assisted, for classification of medical text.  The       
technical approach is exemplar-based: robust information retrieval methods      
find similar, previously-classified texts, and corresponding codes are          
used to suggest likely classifications for a new text.  Phase I focused         
upon implementing experimental software to establish baseline performance       
with several variations of the exemplar-based approach.                         
                                                                                
Phase II builds upon this work to implement a complete Coder's Workstation      
(CWS).  Based upon Phase I results and assessments of commercial                
opportunities, Phase II will focus upon shorter texts (<12 words), which        
are best suited for automated methods.  A ""short-similarity"" capability         
will be added to the Phase I approach to further enhance performance with       
shorter texts.  To evaluate and refine the CWS, Phase II will include           
extensive ""beta testing"" of the software at the Brigham and Women's

"In Phase I of the ""Decision Support System to Identify the At-Risk              
Fetus"" a prototype Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS) was               
developed to interpret electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) data. In               
Phase II, the researchers propose to complete development and test              
the IDSS in preparation for full clinical trials and                            
commercialization. The research is based on the hypothesis that                 
intrapartum EFM and the resulting FHR and UC data provide                       
information that can assist physicians in more accurately                       
differentiating between healthy and at-risk fetuses. The system                 
uses morphological filters to process signals at different scales,              
a neural network to better recognize FHR and UC patterns despite                
EFM noise, and a fuzzy relational structure outcome inferencing. In             
Phase I evidence was generated supporting the hypothesis when the               
IDSS with little training on only 50 cases differentiated between               
healthy and at-risk fetuses as well, and perhaps slightly better                
than three board certified obstetricians with over 40 years of                  
combined clinical experience. The proposed Phase II improvements to             
IDSS would increase the system's sensitivity and specificity so as              
to assist clinicians in more accurately identifying at-risk                     
fetuses, as well as more confidently identifying healthy fetuses so             
as to avoid unnecessary interventions.                                          
                                                                                
PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS The successful completion of Phase             
II should lead to a system which can be used in hospitals and                   
clinicians' offices to better identify the at-risk fetus, thereby               
allowing for the timely implementation of efficacious interventions             
and a reduction in the use of invasive obstetrical interventions,               
including cesarean deliveries, without adversely impacting                      
outcomes. The use of this system in hospitals and private                       
clinicians' offices will also help reduce the costs of national
