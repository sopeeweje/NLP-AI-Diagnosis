"The overall goal of this continuing project is to develop efficient
 algorithms which will permit the construction of realistic and
 comprehensive mathematical models that relate normal and pathological
 renal function to the underlying membrane transport and flow processes in
 the renal tubules and their associated vasculature. The primary thrust of
 our research during the next period will be:
 
 1. To use our present inner medullary models to develop fairly detailed
 architectural models of the inner stripe of the outer medulla and then
 integrate these new models with our present central core and vasa recta n-
 nephron inner medullary models.
 
 2. To include additional solutes and osmolytes and investigate the role of
 osmolyte production in the inner medulla.
 
 3. To incorporate a more detailed representation of transmural movement of
 water and solutes that takes into account both cellular and paracellular
 pathways and also the exchange of electrolytes and water between red blood
 cells and plasma in the vasa recta.
 
 4. Adapt current algorithms for serial computers, - if necessary, develop
 new ones based on our split system solvers - to fully exploit the parallel
 and vector processing capabilities of supercomputers. This is necessary to
 handle the size and complexity of our current and future n-nephron models.
 
 5. If necessary - for parallel and/or vector algorithms - (a) improve
 stability and accuracy of numerical methods, (b) develop hierarchal
 solution strategies, and (c) incorporate continuation and smoothing
 methods.
 
 6. To make the non-linear Schur Complement type methods developed by us
 readily available to other biomedical modelers, for use on minicomputers
 and/or workstations. These include: (a) reduced models of the whole kidney
 and medulla, (b) models of epithelia and isolated perfused tubules, (c)
 tubuloglomerular feedback response models, and (d) neural network models.

"The electronic medical record (EMR) holds great allure to both the              
medical informatics and health services research communities. In this           
project, we propose to enhance the capability of electronic medical             
record (EMR) systems by creating and evaluating tools to extract                
clinical vocabularies as well as patient data from narrative text               
reports. We will apply advanced natural language processing tools from          
the CLARIT system to both of the above problems. We contend that fast           
and robust automated text processing methods are the only way that the          
problems of vocabulary construction and narrative text extraction can           
be solved.                                                                      
                                                                                
We will address the clinical vocabulary problem by utilizing the                
thesaurus extraction techniques already present in the CLARIT system.

The narrative extraction problem will be approached differently than            
in the past, building on the efforts of previous investigators who              
have tackled this problem before but changing the perspective by                
focusing on the development of tools specific to researchers and                
others with a need to extract data from narrative text. This approach

"DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's abstract) The feasibility of a Drowsiness             
Monitoring Device (DMD) to detect EEG indices of drowsiness in real-            
time, was demonstrated during Phase I with an analytical model correctly        
classifying 97.1 percent of sleep episodes and 94.3 percent of awake            
epochs in 20 sleep-deprived subjects. The model employs discriminant            
function analysis (DFA) to characterize and classify one-sec epochs,            
validated against a combination of visual scoring by polysomnographers          
and/or a behavioral measure. Algorithms to detect artifacts in real-time        
(EMG, 60-Hz and gross body/eye movements) were developed. This                  
classification accuracy represents a significant advancement over               
previously reported models and confirms the feasibility of                      
distinguishing EEG characteristics of sleep and waking on a second-by-          
second basis. Phase II will implement a three-level DFA classification          
system to further refine the model, adding sub-class states for                 
vigilance and drowsiness/sleep to improve system accuracy. The multi-           
dimensional time-series DFA analyses will correlate EEG parameters with         
behavioral measures of driving performance to provide quantitative              
predictions of performance decrements associate with sleep onset.               
The model will be validated using a population with demographics                
consistent with the target market for the DMD (e.g., truck drivers)             
during Phase II. In addition, the system will be evaluated with the             
introduction of commonly used legal drugs (caffeine, nicotine, and cold         
medications) to determine the robustness of the model.                          
                                                                                
PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:                                                
The DMD provides three levels of user safety. When sleep onset is               
approaching, the DMD will initiate a verbal warning alarm that must be          
turned off by the user. Alternatively, the DMD can provide verbal               
feedback to ensure the user maintains high levels of alertness during           
activities that require sustained vigilance. The user can also select           
the option for the DMD to recommend the optimal time to take a short            
nap, monitor the length of the nap and awaken the user at the                   
appropriate time.

industry, including airline, railroad, marine and highway transportation        
companies, is the nation's third largest employer of shift workers. Long        
haul truck drivers, in particular, are vulnerable to sleepiness because         
they drive through the night, in most cases unaccompanied, and generally        
sleep less than 6 hours per day at irregular intervals. In addition, an         
estimated 6 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep disorders which         
make them vulnerable to fatigue in the workplace.

Monitoring Device (DMD) to detect EEG indices of drowsiness in real-            
time, was demonstrated during Phase I with an analytical model correctly        
classifying 97.1 percent of sleep episodes and 94.3 percent of awake            
epochs in 20 sleep-deprived subjects. The model employs discriminant            
function analysis (DFA) to characterize and classify one-sec epochs,            
validated against a combination of visual scoring by polysomnographers          
and/or a behavioral measure. Algorithms to detect artifacts in real-time        
(EMG, 60-Hz and gross body/eye movements) were developed. This                  
classification accuracy represents a significant advancement over               
previously reported models and confirms the feasibility of                      
distinguishing EEG characteristics of sleep and waking on a second-by-          
second basis. Phase II will implement a three-level DFA classification          
system to further refine the model, adding sub-class states for                 
vigilance and drowsiness/sleep to improve system accuracy. The multi-           
dimensional time-series DFA analyses will correlate EEG parameters with         
behavioral measures of driving performance to provide quantitative              
predictions of performance decrements associate with sleep onset.               
The model will be validated using a population with demographics                
consistent with the target market for the DMD (e.g., truck drivers)             
during Phase II. In addition, the system will be evaluated with the             
introduction of commonly used legal drugs (caffeine, nicotine, and cold         
medications) to determine the robustness of the model.                          
                                                                                
PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:                                                
The DMD provides three levels of user safety. When sleep onset is               
approaching, the DMD will initiate a verbal warning alarm that must be          
turned off by the user. Alternatively, the DMD can provide verbal               
feedback to ensure the user maintains high levels of alertness during           
activities that require sustained vigilance. The user can also select           
the option for the DMD to recommend the optimal time to take a short            
nap, monitor the length of the nap and awaken the user at the                   
appropriate time.
