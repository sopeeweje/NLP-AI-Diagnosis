"This application is a request for a NIH Research Scientist Development          
Award, Level II RSDA-II) to extend work supported under the RSDA-I              
previously awarded to the applicant (DA00139).  (The RSDA-I granted in 1989     
was titled ""Innovative Statistical Approaches to Drug Abuse Data""; this         
application for the RSDA-II is titled ""Drug Abuse: Epidemiology, Treatment      
Processes, and Outcomes."") The RSDA-Il will continue to ensure financial        
stability and release time from the pursuit of funding for actual research      
work.  The major focus for the applicant during this five-year award is         
continuation of her professional work examining drug use epidemiology and       
treatment interventions for problematic drug abuse. Examining the               
implications of research findings for treatment strategies and developing       
the necessary social policy changes to support the implementation of            
improved treatment strategies is of further interest. The applicant will        
continue her professional work applying innovative statistical                  
methodologies to drug abuse data. To this end, three convergent lines of        
current research will be continued. The first examines drug use and             
treatment utilization among subjects recruited through hospital emergency       
rooms sexually transmitted disease clinics, and jails.  The second project      
is to improve the efficacy and efficiency of matching drug users' treatment     
needs to services. The third involves examining and evaluating the process      
of treatment service delivery with a special focus on the roles and             
functions of drug treatment counselors.

Neuropsychiatric Institute (NPI), organized within the Department of            
Psychiatry, School of Medicine, UCLA. Affiliated with the NPI is the UCLA       
Drug Abuse Research Center, which has been conducting research in drug          
abuse epidemiology natural history of narcotics addiction, treatment            
evaluation, and social policy over the past 20 years.  In this setting, the     
applicant will conduct the proposed research and will receive additional        
training in psychiatric aspects of drug abuse treatment and in the              
implementation of treatment services.  Furthermore. the applicant's             
considerable psychosocial research knowledge and skills in drug abuse

"The goal of this project is to develop a computer algorithm that                
accurately predicts the tertiary fold of a small protein given only             
its amino acid sequence and secondary structure. It will use an                 
evolutionary optimization method with proprietary enhancements                  
invented by the PI. The specific aims of Phase I are to: (1)                    
develop a more natural representation of the problem; (2) implement             
an energy function appropriate for this representation; (3) improve             
the optimization algorithm; and (4) combine these into a simulator              
that successfully predicts tertiary from secondary structure. In                
Phase II this simulator will be extended to predict the tertiary                
structures of larger proteins from their sequences and from sparse              
experimental constraints or imperfect secondary structure                       
predictions.  It will be validated using many proteins of different             
sizes and fold classes and developed into software products for the             
pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. The long-term goal is              
to help satisfy the rapidly growing demand for the accurate                     
prediction of protein structures from sequence information. This                
demand arises not only from the exponential growth of the database              
of sequences, but also from the need to understand the structure

"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer morality

a good prognosis.  However, cancer relapse and death rate in this subset is     
35 to 50% by 5 years.  Chemotherapy is beneficial for the treatment of          
several localized solid tumors after resection and may prove to be useful       
in the treatment of patients with stage I NSCLC.  Thr purpose of this           
project is to define tissue and serum tumor markers in patients with stage      
I NSCLC which predict for early cancer recurrence.  Pathologic stage I          
NSCLC was chosen for study to eliminate the significant influence of            
positive lymph nodes and distant metastases on survival.                        
Immunohistochemical staining will identify potential tissue tumor markers

Specific aim #1 will examine a set of twelve tissue tumor markers in a          
retrospective cohort of 275 stage I NSCLC patients.  Markers are                
categorized by hypothetical method of action: molecular genetic markers         
(Kras, erbB-1, erbB-2, rb, p53, bcl-2), markers of metastatic propensity        
(angiogenesis factor viii), proliferation markers (K1-67) and markers of        
cellular differentiation (Blood group A, H/LeV/LeB, NCAM, CD44).  Results

1) and markers of cellular differentiation (CEA, CA-125, CA 15-3, CYFRA21-

titers of serum markers and tumor histology, stage or mass.  One hundred        
patients in this cohort had a second serum collection after tumor               
resection.  This subgroup of serum will allow analyses of titters before
