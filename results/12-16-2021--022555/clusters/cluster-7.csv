"Stuttering is a disorder of speech with a prevalence estimated to be 1 %
 of the world's population of school-age children. It is often a
 significant communicative problem for the individual, limiting educational
 and employment opportunities and social and psychological adjustment. The
 etiology of stuttering is unknown, and standardized, successful treatments
 for stuttering have not been developed. A major impediment to
 understanding the etiology of stuttering and to the development of
 successful therapeutic techniques is the lack of understanding of the
 physiological bases of the disorder. Stuttering manifests itself as a
 breakdown in speech motor processes. The complex variables known to affect
 the occurrence of stuttering, such as emotional state or linguistic
 complexity, must ultimately have an effect on the physiological events
 necessary for the production of speech. Therefore, to understand
 stuttering it is essential to understand the physiological mechanisms
 underlying disruptions of speech motor processes in stuttering.
 
 The research proposed in the present application addresses this general
 question: What is the nature of the movement disorder associated with
 stuttering? The specific aims are (1) to determine whether motor processes
 show evidence of continuous, underlying disturbances in stutterers'
 speech, (2) to assess whether failures in speech movement control in
 stuttering are related to autonomic nervous system activity and/or to
 metabolic respiratory control, (3) to develop new metrics for the analysis
 of physiological signals related to speech and to apply these new metrics
 to the assessment of stuttering, and (4) to develop pattern recognition
 algorithms to determine if there is a consistent set of physiological
 events associated with stuttering. The results of the proposed studies and
 those completed in the past years of this project should help us to
 understand the complex human behavior that is stuttering. In addition,
 work on this project has significant implications for the study of normal
 speech production and a variety of motor speech disorders that occur in
 neurologically impaired individuals.

"Investigating individual neurons has proven very useful in understanding        
their functionality.  However, all biological systems are composed of a         
multitude of neurons that interact-with a variety of sensory and skeletal       
muscular systems.  Researchers are anxious to have the ability to record        
a large number of neuron firing patterns to study how they communicate          
and interact in a biological system.  Tools such as the multi-channel           
electrode have been created to study the interactions of large numbers          
of neurons.  However, in order to record all the channels, the researcher       
must gang several recorders together.  This leads to difficulties in            
accurately matching all the channels during playback, because of the            
complexity of ganged multiple recorders. R.C - Electronics Inc. proposes        
to build a low cost, high speed digital recorder utilizing PC technology.       
This digital recorder will be able to record continuously to a mass             
storage device at an aggregate rate of 1 MHz.  It will also provide the         
researcher with the ability to acquire up to 96 channels, with each             
channel sampled at 10 KHz; higher speeds will be possible with fewer            
channels.

digital recorder in the multitude of life science applications engaged

"DESCRIPTION (Taken from application abstract):  In the rapidly changing         
health care environment the increasing prominence of managed care has           
prompted a greater reliance on formal clinical guidelines to suppose            
clinical decisions.  Guidelines have been advocated with increasing             
frequency to reduce inappropriate care, control geographic variations in        
practice patterns and make more effective use of health care resources.         
However, guidelines often have little impact on clinical practice because       
physicians are unaware of them, lack confidence in them because the             
justification for their recommendations is not clear or because they are        
inaccessible at the time of patient care or difficult to apply.  Guidelines     
also quickly become out of date as new research data becomes available.         
                                                                                
In order to enhance the quality and usefulness of clinical guidelines, the      
general goal of this project is to develop, deploy and evaluate interactive     
computer based guidelines, supported by an integrated decision theoretic        
model and a linked knowledge base.  This arrangement will use patient           
characteristics to tailor guideline advice to the individual patient.  The      
integrated decision model will provide recommendations for situations not       
addressed by the guideline and also will help to justify guideline              
recommendations by calculating the effectiveness and costs of various           
strategies.  The proposed system also contains links to a knowledge base        
containing the sources of data used in the guideline and the model, so that     
physicians using the system can examine the studies supporting the guideline    
recommendations.  Natural language explanations, generated automatically        
based on the structure of the decision model and the guideline will justify     
the recommendations.  A query capability will enable physicians to look up      
specific data from the knowledge base.  The linked knowledge based also         
ensures that the supported decision model and guideline will be updated         
automatically as new research data is published.                                
                                                                                
The computer system will be used to implement an interactive version of the     
Guidelines for Medical Treatment for Stroke Prevention, developed by the        
American College of Physicians.  The system will be bench tested using a        
series of cases abstracted from the General Medicine practice at the Robert     
Wood Johnson Medical School.  Faculty and house staff internists will serve     
as research subjects to perform a field trial of the system.  This will         
include the extent of previous compliance with the guideline, pre and           
post-testing of medical knowledge pertinent to the guideline, and the degree    
to which the computer-based guideline changes behavior compared to the          
traditional guideline format.  A decision theoretic measure of potential        
benefit will be calculated by comparing decision model evaluations of           
physicians' unaided choices with those recommended by the guideline system.
