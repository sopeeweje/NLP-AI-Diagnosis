"The genes of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region control a variety
 Of functions involved in the immune response, and influence
 susceptibility to over 40 diseases.  Our understanding of the structure
 and function of the HLA genes, their disease associations, and the
 evolutionary features of this multigene family has benefitted from recent
 advances in molecular biology, immunology, disease modelling and
 population genetics.  Theoretical studies in the development of models to
 determine the modes of inheritance of the HLA associated diseases have
 led to a better understanding of the inheritance patterns in insulin
 dependent diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis,
 ankylosing spondylitis, hemochromatosis, celiac disease, and others.  It
 is now clear that many of the HLA associated diseases involve
 heterogeneity in their HLA components, as well as non-HLA genetic
 components.
 
 The specific aims of our research are to study the genetic components in
 the etiology of the HLA associated diseases, and population genetic
 features of the HLA system.  A variety of methods to test modes of
 inheritance of diseases using marker allele information, will be
 developed.  Methods appropriate for the analysis of marker systems which
 are not highly polymorphic, to both detect linkage and determine modes of
 inheritance, will be investigated.  The information content of particular
 pedigree types for LOD score analysis will be investigated.  Two methods
 using patterns of linkage disequilibrium will be investigated to
 determine their usefulness in mapping disease predisposing genes.  A
 number of large collaborative data sets of HLA associated diseases will
 be analyzed.  A framework for genetic counselling of HLA associated, and
 other complex diseases, will be developed.  The results of our studies
 are generally applicable to the mapping and characterization of complex
 human genetic traits.

"DESCRIPTION:  (Adapted from the applicant's abstract):  Medical and             
biological data often come in the form of digitized signals and images, for     
example magnetic resonance images (MRI), ion channel electrical series, and     
human gait paths.  As data acquisition becomes easier, sequences of such        
images or signals are collected, often along with other covariate               
measurements, resulting in data sets where the basic unit of measurement or     
response is a high dimensional object.  This project proposes a battery of      
statistical techniques for modeling and understanding such data, that           
explicitly takes into account and indeed exploits the inherent, spatial, or     
temporal correlation, and when appropriate, relates it to covariate             
information.  By imposing spatial smoothness in the image or signal domain,     
pixel-wise regression, and canonical correlation models can borrow strength     
from neighboring pixels.  This not only improves the overall efficiency of      
these techniques, but also allows identification of important regions rather    
than individual pixels.  The project develops appropriate versions of           
nonparametric regressions for such series of images, as well as data            
descriptions such as clustering, principal component, and singular value        
decomposition models.  In many cases, wavelets will be used to achieve          
spatial smoothness.  In the case of ion channel data, the models are used to    
isolate particular weak high frequency components from correlated noise.        
Much of this work will be carried out in collaboration with radiologists,       
physiologists, and other biomedical researchers working on cancer, heart        
disease and stroke, brain mapping, and gait analysis.
