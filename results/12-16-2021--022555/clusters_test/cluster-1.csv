"Stroke is the major cause of an adult disability epidemic in the US, with a major contribution from post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia (PSCID), the rates of which are disproportionally high among the health disparity populations. Despite the PSCID’s overwhelming impact on public health, a knowledge gap exists with regard to the complex interaction between the acute stroke event and highly prevalent pre-existing brain pathology related to cerebrovascular (VCID) and Alzheimer’s disease, or related dementia (AD/ADRD). Understanding the factors that modulate PSCID risk in relation to index stroke event is critically important for developing personalized prognostication of PSCID, targeted interventions to prevent PSCID, and informing future clinical trial design. In response to this critical challenge, we propose Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY (DISCOVERY), a collaborative network of clinical sites with access to acute stroke populations and the expertise and capacity for systematic assessment of PSCID led by a team of recognized experts in VCID, AD, acute stroke, health disparities, and multi-center research. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine which specific subsets of stroke events cause (or do not cause) PSCID and which additional demographic (sex, race, ethnicity), clinical factors and comorbidities that synergize with acute stroke to result in or prevent PSCID. The overall scientific objective of this study is to elucidate mechanisms of brain resilience/susceptibility to PSCID in diverse US populations based on complex interplay between life-course exposure to multiple vascular risk factors, pre-existing burden of microvascular and neurodegenerative pathology, the effect of strategic acute stroke lesions, and the mediating effect of genomic/epigenomic variation. We will achieve this goal by implementing the DISCOVERY Network of 30 clinical sites, which under the leadership of the Administrative Core and guided by the research strategy delineated by the Recruitment and Retention, Statistics, and Repository Cores, will conduct a prospective, multi- center, observational, nested-cohort study of 8,000 nondemented ischemic and hemorrhagic incident stroke patients within 72 hours of symptom onset, who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years, with serial cognitive evaluations and assessments of functional outcome, with subsets undergoing research MRI and PET and comprehensive genetic/genomic and fluid biomarker testing. In a series of systematic, hypothesis driven experiments we will: 1) identify the independent and combined effect of the acute stroke lesion, pre-existing burden of disease, and baseline markers of brain resilience on PSCID; 2) examine the role of acute stroke as a critical factor in accelerating AD/ADRD and VCID pathology leading to PSCID; and 3) develop two distinct generalizable personalized-medicine models for individual patient outcome prediction and patient selection for clinical trials. DISCOVERY will become a landmark study to unravel the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive disability, early stroke recovery, and potential targets for personalized prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation.

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stroke is the fifth most prevalent cause of death in the U.S. afflicting nearly 800,000 per year. About three
quarters of strokes are first events, underscoring the importance of primary prevention. Designing optimal
preventive strategies requires identification of risk factors and estimation of the risk of stroke. The most recent
American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association Guidelines for the Primary Prevention of
Stroke conclude that “an ideal stroke risk assessment tool that is simple, is widely applicable and accepted,
and takes into account the effects of multiple risk factors does not exist.” One of the most commonly
recommended predictive models is the Framingham Stroke Profile, developed and updated more than 25
years ago. Newer models have been proposed (including the Self-Reported Stroke Risk Stratification tool from
the REGARDS study) but have not been thoroughly validated. Consequently, the Primary Prevention of Stroke
guidelines call for more research “to validate risk assessment tools across age, sex, and race/ethnic groups”
and “to evaluate whether any of the more recently identified risk factors add to the predictive accuracy of
existing scales”.
We propose to address these gaps by aggregating and harmonizing existing patient-level data collected as
part of longitudinal cohort studies supported by the NINDS and NHLBI. The data will be obtained through a
partnership with the coordinating center for the REGARDS Study at the University of Alabama at Birmingham
and by a request submitted to the NIH dbGap repository to obtain data from the Framingham Offspring, ARIC
and MESA cohorts. At the same time, we will expand the advanced machine learning techniques developed
as part of our currently funded NIH BD2K award to Duke. We will apply these models to the harmonized data
to facilitate development and validation of prediction tool for primary strokes. These complex analyses will
require advanced computational resources that will utilize the AHA's Precision Medicine Platform (PMP), built
based on Amazon Web Services.

"Human neural stem cell (hNSC) therapy for stroke is showing promise as it moves from the
bench into early clinical trials to treat the long term disabilities resulting from stroke. This
provides hope for the millions of Americans living with the chronic, debilitating effects of stroke.
Major questions remain, however, about how stem cells injected into the brain drive stroke
recovery. A clue to stem cell mechanism of action is the recent discovery of the positive
correlation between stroke recovery and a brain MRI signal – T2-FLAIR signal– in stroke
patients treated with stem cells. We have successfully reproduced this stem cell-induced FLAIR
signal in stroke-injured rats, and shown that its associated with inflammation. This led to our
central hypothesis: stem cell transplantation drives recovery by inducing a regenerative
inflammatory response. The objective of this grant is to use a rat model of subcortical stroke to
investigate the immunomodulatory effects of hNSC transplanted at the chronic stage of stroke,
at the regional, cellular and molecular levels using a multimodal approach. In Aim1 we use MRI
and PET imaging to identify which brain regions show inflammatory changes after hNSC
transplantation, and which inflammatory regions best correlate with recovery. This will also test
the utility of these clinically relevant imaging modalities as biomarkers for stroke recovery. In
Aim 2 we identify the immune changes induced by hNSC treatment using multiple tools to
characterize the types and molecular signatures of the immune cells present, and their spatial
interactions. In Aim 3 we determine which hNSC-secreted factors modulate the immune
response by testing several candidates, in vitro and in vivo, using CRISPR tools to modulate
expression of key candidate factors. We will study the impact of manipulating the levels of these
proteins on stroke recovery and immunomodulation. Upon conclusion of the study, we will have
made significant advancements in understanding how hNSC-induced immunomodulation affects
brain repair. This contribution is significant because it will: a) identify potential biomarkers, both
pre- and post-treatment, for hNSC-induced recovery; b) begin to delineate the molecular
pathways involved in brain repair; and c) ultimately lead to identification of novel therapies for
stroke.

"Project Summary
Every four minutes an American dies from stroke, equating to approximately 1 in every 19 US deaths annually. Strokes
are classiﬁed as ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic strokes make up 87% of all strokes and are caused by a blockage in
a blood vessel (or artery) resulting in a lack of blood to the brain. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when an artery in the
brain leaks or ruptures releasing excess blood in or around the brain. Incorrect classiﬁcation can have dire consequences
as treating a patient suffering from a hemorrhagic stroke (bleed) with anticoagulant drugs (used to dissolve blood clots
for ischemic strokes) can prove fatal. Early action is of the utmost importance as each passing minute that brain cells lack
the proper blood ﬂow additional cells die. Current classiﬁcation methods require tests performed at the hospital, e.g., CT
or MRI scans of the patient's brain, leading to treatment delays. These delays are particularly lengthy for patients living
in rural communities.
 Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is an emerging medical imaging modality that is inexpensive, has no ionizing
radiation, and provides portable high-contrast images using harmless surface current and voltage measurements (e.g., on
the head using a ﬂexible hat) to recover the internal point-wise electrical properties (e.g., inside the brain). EIT can recover
conductivity, a measure of how easily current ﬂows through a material, as well as permittivity, a measure of the ability of a
material to store a charge. A hemorrhagic stroke corresponds to an area of abnormally high conductivity due to the bleed,
whereas an ischemic stroke presents as an area of lower conductivity than expected due cellular swelling from energy
failure.
 The proposed project addresses the important problem of early, fast, portable stroke classiﬁcation with EIT. A critical
barrier for the use of EIT for stroke imaging has been the sensitivity of the image reconstruction algorithms to incorrect
domain modeling and noise in the data. Due to these challenges, most research has focused on monitoring applications,
not helpful for the classiﬁcation task. By contrast, the D-bar reconstruction method proposed here is the only proven
noise and modeling error robust reconstruction method capable of recovering the true conductivity/permittivity using a
low-pass ﬁltering in a nonlinear Fourier domain. D-bar methods have been successful in 2D but their development in
3D is stunted. This proposal focuses on the development of fast, robust D-bar based reconstruction methods for the 3D
partial boundary problem, critical to working with stroke EIT data. Numerical algorithms will be developed for the full
and partial boundary problems in 3D and validated on simulated and experimental data. A priori information, from
anatomical atlases, will be embedded into the methods for increased resolution and stability. As the low-pass ﬁltering
in D-bar methods leads to blurred reconstructions, post-processing through Convolutional Neural Networks will provide
improved image quality. This work will be the ﬁrst to develop robust computational algorithms for 3D EIT data, opening
the door for stroke imaging. 3-Dimensional;Address;Adoption;Algorithms;Alteplase;Ambulances;American;Anatomy;Anticoagulants;Area;Arteries;Atlases;Benign;Blood;Blood Vessels;Blood flow;Brain;Brain hemorrhage;Brain imaging;Bypass;Cancerous;Cells;Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage;Cessation of life;Charge;Chemicals;Classification;Computational algorithm;Data;Detection;Development;Devices;Drug usage;Electric Conductivity;Electrodes;Failure;Fourier Transform;Geometry;Goals;Gold;Head;Health;Hemorrhage;Hospitals;Hour;Image;Ionizing radiation;Ischemic Stroke;Lead;Location;MRI Scans;Mathematics;Measurement;Measures;Medical Imaging;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;Monitor;Noise;Outcome;Patient Monitoring;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Research;Resolution;Risk;Rupture;Rural Community;Scanning;Stroke;Surface;Swelling;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissues;Treatment Protocols;Validation;Work;X-Ray Computed Tomography;base;brain cell;cancer classification;contrast imaging;convolutional neural network;cranium;deep learning;electrical impedance tomography;electrical property;flexibility;follow-up;human subject;image reconstruction;imaging modality;improved;malignant breast neoplasm;mathematical methods;portability;reconstruction;stroke patient;theories;tumor;voltage Direct 3D Reconstruction Methods for Electrical Impedance Tomography for Stroke Imaging","Project Summary

"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the last four years, our group collected >1800 stroke emboli from centers across the US and Canada as part
of the Stroke Thromboembolism Registry of Imaging and Pathology (STRIP). The STRIP registry was our
current R01 award’s Aim 1 and is very fruitful. We have further elucidated the association between clot
histology and revascularization outcomes, as well as clot histology and imaging characteristics. The STRIP
registry has also allowed us to uncover novel mechanisms in stroke thrombosis, catalyzing thrombectomy
device research and thrombolysis related research in our lab.
We believe that the most impactful finding from our registry will be uncovering associations between
histopathology of retrieved emboli and stroke etiology. Developing tools to predict stroke etiology is important
because nearly 40% of strokes are of unknown etiology. Determine stroke etiology (i.e. cardiac source versus
large artery atherosclerosis) is important as secondary stroke prevention strategies are highly dependent on
determination of stroke etiology. However, when we performed superficial quantitative analyses examining the
relationships between fibrin, platelet, WBC and RBC density, our results were unrevealing. Still, we
hypothesize that it remains feasible to predict stroke etiology based of analysis of retrieved stroke emboli
through deep learning and machine learning approaches. Machine learning and deep learning approaches can
also aid in uncovering histological features associated with device and pharmacological failure related to stroke
revascularization.
Thus, this administrative supplement’s goal of is to 1) allow for complete digitization and online archiving of our
database of over 1800 retrieved clot specimens as well as all available anonymized clinical data from Aim 1 of
our current R01 to facilitate deep learning and machine learning and 2) to perform deep learning on the whole

be used to predict stroke etiology based solely off of the histological appearance of retrieved stroke emboli.

"The 2019 U.S. practice guidelines recommend direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as dabigatran, rivarox-
aban, and apixaban over warfarin for stroke prevention in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However,
the selection of a DOAC can be challenging for older ischemic stroke patients. The risk-benefit ratios in second-
ary stroke prevention differ substantially from those in primary prevention. Not only are older stroke survivors at
increased risk for recurrent ischemic events, older age and history of ischemic stroke are also major risk factors
for bleeding complications. While it is known that drug selection should be individualized, it remains unknown
how to tailor anticoagulant therapy according to the effectiveness/safety of the agents and patient unique char-
acteristics. The long-term goal is to use comparative effectiveness research to improve quality of care and out-
comes in patients with cardiovascular disease and stroke. Leveraging the American Heart Association (AHA)
Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Registry (GWTG-Stroke) and Medicare inpatient and Part D database, the over-
all objective of this application is to develop evidence-based strategies to improve appropriate anticoagulant
therapy for secondary prevention in older ischemic stroke patients with AF. The central hypothesis is that differ-
ences exist between DOACs in terms of effectiveness and safety, which have direct implications for therapeutic
selection. Once the relative effectiveness/safety is known, the selection of an anticoagulant can be made based
on patient risk profiles, making treatment safer and more effective. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hy-
pothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the long-term clinical effectiveness and safety
of different DOACs for secondary prevention in older ischemic stroke patients with AF; 2) Investigate DOACs
dosing patterns and evaluate the potential impact of underdosing or overdosing on long-term outcomes. The
proposed research is innovative in four key ways: 1) A patient-centered approach is used to address a real-life
decisional dilemma facing stroke survivors and clinicians; 2) It shifts focus from selected samples in clinical trials
to a nationwide representative stroke population, including traditionally underrepresented subgroups in commu-
nity practice; 3) A novel propensity score inverse probability weighting method using generalized boosted models
(a machine learning technique) will be employed to mimic a trial-type multi-treatment design, uncover treatment
heterogeneity, and minimize selection bias in observational data; 4) Beyond traditional mechanisms of scientific
publications, the evidence generated from this study will be disseminated to stroke survivors, clinicians, and
relevant stakeholders through the AHA GWTG-led national quality initiatives and patient-led efforts to ensure a
rapid translation of seminal findings into clinical practice. The proposed research is significant because it is
expected to help guide personalized anticoagulant therapy in older ischemic stroke survivors that could best

aban, and apixaban over warfarin for stroke prevention in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However,
the selection of a DOAC can be challenging for older ischemic stroke patients. The risk-benefit ratios in second-
ary stroke prevention differ substantially from those in primary prevention. Not only are older stroke survivors at
increased risk for recurrent ischemic events, older age and history of ischemic stroke are also major risk factors
for bleeding complications. While it is known that drug selection should be individualized, it remains unknown
how to tailor anticoagulant therapy according to the effectiveness/safety of the agents and patient unique char-
acteristics. The long-term goal is to use comparative effectiveness research to improve quality of care and out-
comes in patients with cardiovascular disease and stroke. Leveraging the American Heart Association (AHA)
Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Registry (GWTG-Stroke) and Medicare inpatient and Part D database, the over-
all objective of this application is to develop evidence-based strategies to improve appropriate anticoagulant
therapy for secondary prevention in older ischemic stroke patients with AF. The central hypothesis is that differ-
ences exist between DOACs in terms of effectiveness and safety, which have direct implications for therapeutic
selection. Once the relative effectiveness/safety is known, the selection of an anticoagulant can be made based
on patient risk profiles, making treatment safer and more effective. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hy-
pothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the long-term clinical effectiveness and safety
of different DOACs for secondary prevention in older ischemic stroke patients with AF; 2) Investigate DOACs
dosing patterns and evaluate the potential impact of underdosing or overdosing on long-term outcomes. The
proposed research is innovative in four key ways: 1) A patient-centered approach is used to address a real-life
decisional dilemma facing stroke survivors and clinicians; 2) It shifts focus from selected samples in clinical trials
to a nationwide representative stroke population, including traditionally underrepresented subgroups in commu-
nity practice; 3) A novel propensity score inverse probability weighting method using generalized boosted models
(a machine learning technique) will be employed to mimic a trial-type multi-treatment design, uncover treatment
heterogeneity, and minimize selection bias in observational data; 4) Beyond traditional mechanisms of scientific
publications, the evidence generated from this study will be disseminated to stroke survivors, clinicians, and
relevant stakeholders through the AHA GWTG-led national quality initiatives and patient-led efforts to ensure a
rapid translation of seminal findings into clinical practice. The proposed research is significant because it is
expected to help guide personalized anticoagulant therapy in older ischemic stroke survivors that could best

Project Title: Comparative Safety of Seizure Prophylaxis within the Medicare Program
1R01AG073410-01
Each year thousands of Medicare beneficiaries with Alzheimer’s disease and/or Alzheimer’s-related dementias (AD/ADRD) receive anticonvulsant drugs for seizure prophylaxis. These drugs are life-saving given the severity of seizure sequalae, but also life-threatening because of serious adverse events. Patients with AD/ADRD are particularly vulnerable given their high susceptibility to both stroke and adverse events. The decision to start and stop anticonvulsants also might change when the patient have AD/ADRD, in part because anticonvulsant therapy management becomes more complex when patients have difficulty with therapy having a narrow therapeutic range or difficulty recognizing early complication symptoms. There are no trial data to guide decisions about prophylaxis after an ischemic stroke among patients with or without AD/ADRD. The sparse and conflicted existing literature has been limited by the difficulty assessing relevant measures, e.g., stroke severity or AD/ADRD status, in claims. Medicare claims offer potential, but lack well-validated definitions for stroke severity, AD/ADRD status, seizures, or adverse effects. We will address these issues using a novel dataset with individual-level linked longitudinal information from registries, electronic health records, and Medicare claims, and will develop prediction models for key baseline and outcome variables. Then, using a random 20% sample of national traditional, fee-for-service Medicare claims over 18 years (2006-23), we will emulate clinical trials assessing two critical decisions in the setting of first mild to moderate ischemic stroke among patients with or without AD/ADRD: a) initiating outpatient prophylaxis versus not; and b) stopping prophylaxis at six months versus continuing. We will apply multiple analytical tools to address confounding and other challenges. We will stratify our population based on AD/ADRD status because the patterns of strokes, post-stroke seizures, and treatment complications differ among patients with compared to those without AD/ADRD, as could the clinical management patterns. We have three aims: 1) To validate claims-based prediction models for our study variables; 2) To emulate a clinical trial comparing outpatient prophylaxis initiation versus not; and 3) To emulate a clinical trial comparing stopping outpatient prophylaxis at six months versus continuing. This comparative safety study could inform future policy and clinical care and improve stroke and AD/ADRD care, e.g., through adjustments in Medicare quality incentives and clinical guidelines. Moreover, these data could help inform patients, families, clinicians, and policy makers about how we can improve care for patients who could require seizure prophylaxis.

"Project Summary / Abstract
 Upper-limb paresis is the most common impairment following a stroke affecting 75% of stroke survivors,
which can be more prominent in one of the two limbs. Most recovery of functional impairments occurs within
the first few weeks after stroke and plateaus thereafter. Unfortunately, even after patients reach a stable phase
of recovery, their functional level of the stroke-affected limb may decline. Therefore, it is clinically important to
maintain the regained functional level beyond the first couple weeks of spontaneous recovery by continuing to
practice the use of the affected limb during daily living.
 Wearable technologies have emerged as a low-cost, objective tool to monitor the performance of the upper
limbs during activities of daily living (ADLs). However, to date, there exists no study that has investigated the
effectiveness of a mobile-health (mHealth) system aiming to enable high-dosage motor performance in chronic
stroke survivors in the real-world setting. Specifically, the optimal configuration of the goal setting, feedback
mechanism and ways to share data among the stakeholders (patients and clinicians) remains unknown.
 This proposal aims to develop and validate an mHealth technology that aims to encourage affected limb
use during the performance of ADLs in chronic stroke survivors. To accomplish this goal, we will employ the
unique finger-worn ring sensor (accelerometer), developed by our academic-industry partnership, that can
capture both gross-arm and fine-hand use of the limbs that are essential in the performance of ADLs. We will
study important aspects of making positive behavior changes to encourage the affected limb use by fully
leveraging the computational insights drawn from sensor data combined with clinical insights from providers.
 To accomplish this research goal, Aim 1 will focus on the development of an mHealth platform, composed of
body-networked sensors and cloud-based systems, to monitor the real-world use of the limbs in chronic stroke
survivors. In Aim 2, we will develop machine-learning based algorithms to extract clinically meaningful
information regarding real-world upper limb use from sensor data. Aim 3 will investigate the optimal design of
our mHealth system – such as individual tailoring of the goal, design of the feedback, medium and timing to
deliver feedback, and ways to share data among the stakeholders (patients and clinicians) – via human-centered
design approaches. Finally, in Aim 4, we will validate the short-term (8 weeks) effectiveness of the mHealth
system in improving the use of the affected limb through a field deployment study.
 We believe that outcomes of this project will open a new door leading to previously unexplored datasets and
understanding of patient-technology interactions to promote positive behavior changes to enable a high dosage
of physical and occupational therapy, which can form the basis of a wide range of future investigations of
hemiparesis rehabilitation and personalized disease management.

"Abstract
 Lacunar strokes are small infarctions of deep penetrator end arteries that supply deep areas of brain
including the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus and pons. The “cause” of lacunar strokes has been
controversial. C Miller Fisher was the first to suggest that hypertension was one cause, noting lipohyalinosis
(inflammation, fibrinoid necrosis of vessel wall) in smaller penetrating arteries (<200um) occurred only in
hypertensives. He also showed, however, that larger lacunar strokes were often associated with
microatheroma associated narrowing of larger penetrating arteries. This pathology is now thought to be the
most common and associated with lipid abnormalities and diabetes. Moreover, some lacunar strokes are now
thought to be associated with intracranial atherosclerosis of the parent artery at the origin of the penetrators.
Though lacunar strokes were not traditionally associated with large vessel extracranial atherosclerosis or
cardioembolism, there are now a number of cases where lacunar strokes have been associated with large
vessel atherosclerosis or cardiac causes. Indeed, in our own recent study we showed that as many as ~50% of
small deep infarcts (>15mm in size) were predicted to be due to large vessel atherosclerosis or to
cardioembolic disease. It is crucial to identify the correct causes of lacunar strokes because treatments differ:
drugs for hypertension vs drugs for lipid abnormalities, surgery for large vessel carotid disease, anticoagulants
for cardioembolic disease, and anti-platelet agents for lacunar strokes associated with hypertension or
abnormal lipids or diabetes. The biology of lacunar strokes has been studied very little, and there are no
accepted biomarkers for lacunar stroke or its causes. Our group, however, has begun to provide novel insights
into how the immune and clotting profiles in peripheral blood differ in lacunar strokes compared to large vessel
and cardioembolic strokes. We have shown that the immune response in large vessel and cardioembolic
cortical strokes is mainly associated with neutrophil genes, whereas the immune response in lacunar stroke
associated with hypertension /lipids/ diabetes is associated with inflammatory monocyte-related genes.
However, since the preliminary studies were performed on whole blood, there is a great need to study
individual immune cell types in these different causes of ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study we will isolate
neutrophils and monocytes in patients with lacunar stroke compared to large vessel and cardioembolic stroke.
We will perform RNA sequencing on those cells in the following aims which allows us to measure expression
levels of >250,000 alternatively spliced transcripts which are derived from the ~20,000 coding genes.
 Specific Aim #1. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression
profiles in monocytes, neutrophils and whole blood differ for subcortical lacunar strokes associated with
hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardioembolism compared to each
other and compared to matched controls.
 Specific Aim #2. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression
profiles for subcortical lacunar strokes with hypertension, lipids or diabetes are associated with monocytes, and
differ from cortical large vessel and cardioembolic strokes which are associated mainly with neutrophils.
 Specific Aim #3a. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to derive the minimum number of transcripts
from Aim #1 that differentiate the different causes of lacunar strokes including hypertension, abnormal lipids,
diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardiac disease. Specific Aim #3b. Use the profiles derived in Aim
#3a to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in a second cohort using qRT-PCR to measure expression and SVM
to perform predictions with >85% sensitivity and specificity.
 Significance: Identifying the causes of lacunar strokes based upon splice variant expression in
individual blood cell types is important since it would affect therapy used for secondary stroke prevention.

scientific publications, the evidence generated from this study will be disseminated to stroke survivors, clinicians,
and relevant stakeholders through the AHA GWTG-led national quality initiatives and patient-led efforts to insure
a rapid translation of seminal findings into clinical practice. The proposed research is significant, because it is
expected to help guide personalized antiplatelet therapy in older ischemic stroke survivors that could best meet
their needs and lead to better outcomes most meaningful to patients. Ultimately, such knowledge has the poten-
tial to inform evidence-based treatment decisions in stroke that now afflicts more than 7.2 million Americans.",10104421,R01AG062770,['R01AG062770'],AG,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10104421,R01,2021,509566
"Abstract
The following K23 proposal is for Dr. Nils Petersen, a Neurocritical Care and Stroke Neurologist at Yale-New
Haven Hospital, and Assistant Professor at Yale University School of Medicine. Dr. Petersen is a physician-
scientist with specialized knowledge of human cerebral hemodynamics who is investigating personalized,
autoregulation-guided blood pressure management after ischemic stroke. About 40% of patients with ischemic
stroke due to intracranial large-vessel occlusion (LVO) are rendered non-ambulatory, bedridden or deceased
despite treatment with endovascular thrombectomy. Abnormalities in cerebrovascular autoregulation in the acute
phase of LVO stroke increase the risk of secondary brain injury from relative cerebral hypo- or hyperperfusion.
Thus, autoregulation-guided, personalized blood pressure management presents a promising alternative to the
current practice of targeting fixed thresholds. By providing a more favorable physiologic environment for the
injured brain, the autoregulation-guided approach may reduce secondary brain injury and improve outcomes.
Preliminary data obtained by Dr. Petersen have demonstrated the feasibility of a research plan that uses near-
infrared spectroscopy and real-time data processing to identify a patient-specific blood pressure range that yields
optimal brain blood flow. This research proposal will evaluate if blood pressure management outside
personalized limits of autoregulation increases the risk for neurologic worsening from infarct progression or
hemorrhagic transformation, leading to increased rates of unfavorable outcome (Aim 1). Next, Dr. Petersen will
evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic blood pressure interventions and explore the feasibility of an
intervention protocol targeting a personalized blood pressure range (Aim 2). Under the expert mentorship of Dr.
Kevin Sheth, Chief of Neurocritical Care, Dr. Randolph Marshall, Director of Stroke Division at Columbia
University, and Dr. Cynthia Brandt, Director of Medical Informatics, this K23 award will allow Dr. Petersen 1) to
acquire skills in informatics, advanced signal processing and machine learning in order to enhance current
methods of quantifying cerebral autoregulation, 2) to develop expertise in clinical trial design, 3) to build a
research group dedicated to discovery and clinical evaluation of physiology-based individualized treatment
strategies after stroke, and 4) to foster inter-institutional collaboration and data-sharing. This proposal will
leverage Yale’s cutting-edge neuro-monitoring technologies along with extensive informatics and research
resources from the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation to generate new insights into cerebral hemodynamics
and identify treatment opportunities. At the conclusion of this award period, Dr. Petersen will be well-positioned
to become an independently-funded investigator conducting high-quality research in the area of cerebral
hemodynamics. His long-term goal is to use neuro-monitoring to develop physiology-based, personalized, early
interventions to reduce the disability and morbidity associated with stroke.

"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and the most common stroke-related impairment is
upper-limb hemiparesis, affecting 80% of stroke patients acutely and 40% chronically. Full recovery is unlikely
with current rehabilitation approaches, and as a result, stroke reduces quality of life, increases healthcare costs,
and burdens caregivers. The long-term goal of this project is to leverage assistive bionic devices to restore
motor function and promote long-term neuro-regeneration, ultimately replacing more expensive and less
effective rehabilitation approaches with a patient-centered rehabilitation strategy. The objective of this proposal
is to control assistive bionic exoskeletons and quantify stroke recovery with electromyographic (EMG) recordings
of residual muscle activity from the paretic arm. Our central hypothesis is that an EMG-controlled powered
orthosis – that assists individuals in activities of daily living – can be used as a patient-specific rehabilitative tool
that improves stroke recovery. Aim 1 will adapt dexterous EMG-control algorithms for upper-limb orthoses, and
then demonstrate improved hand dexterity and functional mobility for stroke patients. Aim 2 will utilize large EMG
datasets over time to precisely quantify changes in muscle strength and spasticity throughout recovery and to
provide robust long-term control of assistive devices via deep learning. Aim 3 consists of a pilot study to
determine the feasibility of patient-specific assistive-device-driven rehabilitation. The proposed research is
innovative because it will address gaps in knowledge critical to merging assistive and rehabilitative devices.
These findings are significant because they will enable devices that can immediately and simultaneously
promote usage, strengthen muscles, and provide closed-loop visual feedback – thereby merging multiple
effective rehabilitation strategies into a single holistic approach. This proposal will have a positive impact on
society by increasing rehabilitation compliance, promoting independence and improving recovery outcomes for
stroke patients, ultimately reducing healthcare costs and improving patients’ quality of life.
