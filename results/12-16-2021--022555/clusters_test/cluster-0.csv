"Project Summary
We and others have shown that altered hemodynamics and shear stress can lead to congenital heart defects
(CHDs), but still there is limited information on how these forces affect molecular signaling. Studying the impact
of abnormal hemodynamics and shear stress becomes even more urgent when we consider that perturbed blood
flow may be a contributing factor to a large percentage of CHDs regardless of whether the initial trigger is
environmental or genetic. Although our group and others have recently developed extremely useful optical
imaging tools (e.g., optical coherence tomography – OCT) to assess hemodynamics and shear stress, and
connected these measurements to CHDs, it has been difficult to link shear stress with the affected molecular
pathways. Our group and others have performed qPCR experiments on control and shear-stress perturbed
hearts to see how abnormal hemodynamics alters gene expression. However, this approach requires the entire
embryonic heart for one measurement, missing all spatial and cell-type information, particularly at the
endocardial layer. In order to successfully assess how shear stress affects molecular signaling throughout the
looping heart, we need to improve upon our OCT methods, develop 3D methods for assessing embryonic heart
gene expression, and create an advanced image processing pipeline to analyze data and relate regional shear
stress to gene expression.
 This renewal proposal will continue our work developing tools that can lead to a more sophisticated
understanding of how cardiac function (e.g., hemodynamics and electrical impulse conduction) affects heart
development, enabling potential therapies to avoid or mitigate CHDs. In this proposal, we will focus on developing
tools to understand how oscillatory shear stress (quantified as oscillatory shear index - OSI) influences gene
expression and leads to CHDs. In our preliminary studies, we increased regurgitant blood flow (causing
increased OSI) to show that alterations to OSI leads to smaller cardiac cushions (valve precursors) and
ultimately, to CHDs. Increased regurgitant blood flow and smaller cushions is present in our two disease models
(fetal alcohol spectrum disorders – FASD; velo-cardio-facial syndrome/Digeorge) and our FASD prevention
compounds partially normalize blood flow, cardiac cushion size, and greatly reduce morbidity and CHDs.
 Our specific aims include 1) advance our OCT system and shear stress analysis, 2) develop fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) protocols to measure gene expression in 3D, 3) develop an image processing pipeline
to relate gene expression to shear stress, and 4) determine the impact of shear stress on gene expression. Upon
completion, we will have significantly more information on how shear stress affects molecular expression. With
this knowledge, we will be better equipped to determine which molecular pathways are most influenced by altered
hemodynamics, to develop earlier detection methods and potentially develop strategies to prevent CHDs more
effectively. 3-Dimensional;Affect;Algorithms;Area;Betaine;Biological Process;Blood flow;Cardiac;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cell Shape;Cells;Cohort Studies;Computer software;Congenital Heart Defects;Data;Development;DiGeorge Syndrome;Diffusion;Disease;Disease model;Early Diagnosis;Embryo;Embryonic Heart;Fetal Alcohol Exposure;Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder;Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization;Funding;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Genetic;Glutathione;Heart;Histology;Image;Imaging Device;Immunohistochemistry;In Situ;Knowledge;Lead;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Measurement;Measures;Mechanical Stress;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;Morphology;Optical Coherence Tomography;Optics;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Play;Positioning Attribute;Prevention;Protocols documentation;Quail;RNA;Reporting;Role;Sequencing By Hybridizations;Shprintzen syndrome;Signal Transduction;Specificity;Structure;System;Testing;Tissues;Tube;Work;addiction;cardiogenesis;cell type;deep learning;detection method;experience;experimental study;heart function;hemodynamics;image processing;improved;in situ sequencing;indexing;nervous system disorder;novel;optical imaging;prevent;shear stress;statistics;tool;virtual Optical Tools to Assess the Role of Cardiac Function in the Development of Congenital Heart Defects","Project Summary

"Shear Stress and Light-Field to Elucidate the Initiation of Cardiac Outflow Tract
Biomechanical forces modulate cardiac morphogenesis, and mutations in mechano-sensitive signaling
pathways result in congenital heart defects. During the previous funding cycle, our team custom-built a Light-
Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM) with sub-voxel resolution to enhance axial resolution needed to
provide a large field-of-view. This laser optical system allowed for imaging pulsatile vs. oscillatory shear stress-
mediated Notch signaling to initiate endocardial trabeculation. We demonstrated that spatial (/x) and
temporal (/t) variations in shear stress modulates Notch-EphrinB2-Neureguilin-1 signaling in the
endocardium to activate erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase (ErbB2) that promotes proliferation of trabeculation.
By integrating LSFM, computation, and transgenic models, we further established that trabeculation dissipates
intracardiac shear stress-generated kinetic energy; thus, mitigating ventricular remodeling. However, it remains
unclear what would be the consequences of reduced myocardial contractility or altered intracardiac flow
dynamics on valve morphogenesis. Thus, we seek to integrate light-sheet (Bessel-Gaussian beam arrays) with
a new 2) light-field (microlens array). The former provides non-diffracting illumination, and the latter provides
volumetric detection as a paradigm shift to image both myocardial contractility and intracardiac flow dynamics
in the outflow tract (OFT). Our preliminary study reveals that shear-mediated Notch1b expression in the
endocardium of OFT regulates endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT); however, the
mechanotransduction causation whereby myocardial contractility and intracardiac shear stress reciprocally
interact to form bicuspid valves and subsequent remodeling to multi-cuspid valves remains elusive. Thus, our
hypothesis is that integration of the new light-field system with imaging computation enhances spatiotemporal
resolution needed to decouple myocardial contraction from intracardiac flow dynamics that modulates
Notch1b-EndoMT to mediate valve morphogenesis in the OFT. In Aim 1, we plan to integrate light-sheet with
the new light-field system for 4-D volumetric imaging of valve formation in the OFT. Our goal is to capture
myocardial contractility and intracardiac shear stress at one snapshot. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate the
interaction between intracardiac shear stress and myocardial contractility underlying valve morphogenesis. Our
goal is to decouple hemodynamic shear from contractile forces that mediate Notch1b-mediated EndoMT. In
Aim 3, we will determine the relative role of shear stress and contractility underlying Notch1b-mediated
EndoMT. Our goal is to elucidate the relative role of contractility and intracardiac stress to transmit Notch1b-
EndoMT signaling underlying bicuspid-valve formation. Overall, our team aims to establish the micro-
environment in which intracardiac flow dynamics and myocardial contractility interact to modulate OFT valve
formation, with clinical significance to aortic valvular disease. 4D Imaging;Aortic Valve Stenosis;Arteries;Bicuspid;Biomechanics;Blood flow;Cardiac;Computer Models;Congenital Heart Defects;Coupled;Cuspid;Custom;Data Reporting;Defect;Detection;ERBB2 gene;Endocardium;Endothelium;Etiology;Fluorescence Microscopy;Funding;Gaussian model;Genes;Genetic Models;Genetic Recombination;Goals;Heart;Image;Kinetics;Lasers;Light;Lighting;Liquid substance;Machine Learning;Mediating;Mesenchymal;Microscopy;Mitral Valve;Morphogenesis;Mutation;Myocardial;Myocardial Contraction;Neuregulin 1;Operative Surgical Procedures;Optics;Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases;Reporter;Resolution;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Stress;Structure;System;Testing;Time;Transgenic Model;Transgenic Organisms;Variant;Ventricular;Ventricular Remodeling;aortic valve;aortic valve disorder;automated segmentation;base;clinically significant;congenital heart disorder;erbB-2 Receptor;hemodynamics;imaging Segmentation;mechanotransduction;multidisciplinary;notch protein;optical imaging;response;shear stress;simulation;single-cell RNA sequencing;spatiotemporal;transcriptomics Shear stress and light-field to elucidate the initiation of cardiac outflow tract","Shear Stress and Light-Field to Elucidate the Initiation of Cardiac Outflow Tract
