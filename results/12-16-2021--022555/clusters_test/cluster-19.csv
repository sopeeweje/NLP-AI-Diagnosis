"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY
IDENTIFYING METABOLIC VULNERABILITIES IN LUNG CANCER
Lung Cancer is the most common cause of cancer deaths world-wide. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors and
immunotherapy have been shown to be effective in a subset of patients; however, the overall survival rate for
this disease remains low especially for metastatic disease. Moreover, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients
have a poor prognosis, and there especially exists a gap in knowledge in understanding SCLC and identifying
effective therapeutic strategies. Our goal in this proposal is to understand the underlying biology of key drivers
in lung cancer by identifying metabolic vulnerabilities that can ultimately be used as single agents or combined
with immunotherapy to target lung cancer therapeutically. We will achieve this goal by engaging experts that
have developed preclinical models with common molecular signatures in non-small cell (NSCLC) and small cell
lung cancer (SCLC) and cutting-edge metabolomics. We have an active and collaborative group that meets twice
monthly with projects and manuscripts that are co-authored by the leaders of each project and core. Additionally,
our Program Project Grant (PPG) team is located at Moffitt Cancer Center, which is an ideal place to study the
pathogenesis of lung cancer. Florida is number 2 in the country in terms of newly diagnosed lung cancer patients.
Moffitt treats 10% of these cases. The PPG consists of four projects and four cores. These projects and cores
collaborate and synergize to meet four objectives: i. To identify metabolic vulnerabilities in lung cancers through
integrative analysis of in vivo and ex vivo models with common molecular signatures, including p53,
NRF2/KEAP1, and MYC (Project #1, led by Dr. Flores, Project #2, led by Dr. DeNicola, Project #3, led by Drs.
Cleveland and Haura, and Project #4, led by Dr. Rodriguez with support from the Administrative Core #1, led
by Drs. Flores and Haura, Preclinical Models and Pathology Core #2, led by Drs. Cress and Karreth, Metabolism
Core #3, led by Dr. Koomen, and Data Science Core #4, led by Dr. Fridley), ii. To identify metabolic
vulnerabilities that synergize with immunotherapy through examining the tumor microenvironment and gaining a
deep molecular understanding of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). (Project #4 in collaboration with
Projects #1 and #2 and Core #2), iii. To build mouse models as a platform to understand the metabolic pathways
utilized by lung cancers with different genetic signatures and to assess therapeutic strategies for lung cancer.
(Core #2 supporting Projects #1-4), and iv. To share resources and data locally and globally to obtain an
integrated molecular understanding of metabolic vulnerabilities in lung cancer. (Core #4 leading efforts from All
Projects and Cores).

"ABSTRACT (PROJECT DESCRIPTION)
The rollout of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening programs is accelerating in the United
States, aiming for earlier detection of lung cancer to improve long-term survival. However, a consequence of
such imaging programs is the increased discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs). Significant ques-
tions remain around the effective management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs: while many are benign,
a fraction will go on to become cancerous. Diagnostic models for IPNs and associated management guidelines
have been described previously, but their real-world validation is limited. Moreover, the majority of models only
use a “snapshot” of the IPN at a single point in time and fail to take into consideration progressive changes.
Opportunities now exist to advance such predictive models by encompassing the patient's evolving medical
history, combining clinical and imaging biomarkers to improve prediction and individually-tailor the management
of IPNs over time.
The objective of this imaging informatics proposal is the development of a clinical decision support tool for the
management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs. We address two key challenges: 1) the development of
a continuous-time model for predicting how the IPN will evolve; and 2) the use of this prediction to determine a
series of actions over time that will optimize (screening) outcomes for the individual. We first explore the devel-
opment of a continuous time belief network (CTBN), a temporal probabilistic model to predict the likelihood of a
patient to develop lung cancer. Unlike traditional approaches, CTBNs do not require fixed sampling frequency of
the data over time (e.g., all observations made annually) and are thus more amenable to real-world clinical
settings and observational datasets. The probabilities computed through the CTBN are subsequently input into
a partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to guide IPN management decisions. From the
POMDP, policies (sequences of actions over time) can be chosen to achieve a desired goal (e.g., minimizing
time to diagnosis), given past and current observations/decisions for an individual. For both the CTBN and
POMDP, we explore novel methods in the design and implementation, overcoming computational challenges to
realize translation of these models into practice. A web-based interface is implemented, providing a clinical de-
cision making tool for physicians to understand the models' recommendations. Evaluation focuses on assessing
the performance of the CTBN and POMDP relative to known outcomes and compared to other conventional
methods (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, dynamic belief networks); as well as the overall impact of the
system to influence decision-making. This effort advances our past research in probabilistic models and capital-
izes on expertise in lung cancer screening, including past leadership of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST).
The result of this effort will be a set of informatics-driven modeling tools and new temporal predictive models
informing IPN management.

"ABSTRACT
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States and worldwide despite
advances in early detection, treatment, and smoking cessation programs. It was reported by the National Lung
Screening Trial (NLST) that screening with low dose computed tomography (LDCT) scans may reduce lung
cancer mortality by 20% compared to chest x-ray. This conclusion ultimately led to the approval and
reimbursement for lung cancer screening using LDCT among asymptomatic adults with a history of tobacco
smoking. However, LDCT-based screening often results in a large number of indeterminate nodules that later
turn out to be non-cancerous. With increasing implementation of LDCT-based lung cancer screening in the U.S.,
the detection of indeterminate lung nodules during lung cancer screening is likely to increase. To reduce
unnecessary diagnostic procedures, such as follow-up CT scan, positron emission tomography (PET)/CT exam,
and invasive biopsies, a tool that can easily and accurately assess the malignancy and invasiveness of the
indeterminate findings will be a welcomed addition to clinical practice. Different levels of invasiveness typically
indicate different treatment plans and can often predict the treatment outcome. Compared to the investigative
efforts dedicated to discriminating benign from malignant nodules, very limited effort has been focused on
assessing the invasiveness of the suspicious nodules and explore the underlying factors associated with
invasiveness. We proposed to develop and validate a novel computer tool to non-invasively assess the
invasiveness of adenocarcinomas using LDCT scans from a large and diverse lung cancer database with
pathology outcome. We will investigate and identify how image-based features contribute to invasiveness. Our
exciting preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of developing and implementing such a tool and its highly
translational potential. We believe that our computer tool will be a tremendously useful addition to the clinical
practice of lung cancer diagnosis and treatment. Its availability will: (1) enable a timely and accurate diagnosis
of lung cancer, (2) limit the need for further imaging, biopsies, and possible surgery, and (3) facilitate an optimal
selection of the treatment approach (e.g., surgical resection or radiotherapy). Ultimately, we want to improve
survival and the quality of life of lung cancer patients.

"ABSTRACT
Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating
granulomas in affected organs, primarily in the lungs. Approximately 30% of patients with sarcoidosis progress
to debilitating disease; however, the drivers of susceptibility or resilience to disease remain poorly understood.
An inflammatory response to an undefined antigen is postulated as the etiology of granuloma formation, and
the pathogenesis has been suggested to involve gene-pathogen interaction, yet analysis of single genes or
microbes has not proven applicable to diagnosis of all forms of sarcoidosis. Indeed, rather than a single
organism, the disease may represent an interaction between the community of organisms that comprise the
lung microbiome (community of organisms that live in and on us) and the host immune response. We propose
that understanding the microbiome/host interaction will suggest strategies for precision medicine approaches
to sarcoidosis. This proposal addresses this significant gap by investigating interactions between the lung
microbiome, host immune and clinical responses in sarcoidosis using multiomics approaches – a critically
innovative strategy. Our preliminary data support our novel hypotheses. First, we identified distinct lung
microbiomes that differentiated patients with sarcoidosis versus controls. Second, our results identified
biomarkers of disease severity that were associated with decreased lung function. Third, a recurrent analytic
theme that emerged, regardless of the type of -omic analysis, was that sarcoidosis is characterized by
pathways related to apoptosis and autophagy, which is consistent with our observation of decreased
abundance of peripheral lymphocytes and functional immune anergy. These data led us to our Overall
Hypothesis: Lung microbiome and host immune interactions characterized by apoptosis and autophagy
pathways influence sarcoidosis clinical course. This hypothesis will be tested by an observational prospective
and validation study of sarcoidosis patients at 5 time points to facilitate time series analyses. Aims 1 and 2
focus on lung microbiome or host immune responses, respectively, in relation to clinical course of sarcoidosis.
Using these data in Aim 3, predictive models will be constructed based on integrated data of metagenomic and
host-immune interactions. The novelty and significance of our multiomics strategy is to construct models for
precision medicine therapies to harness bioinformatic strategies into focused, patient-specific approaches. The
long-term significance of this study is to define pathways for sarcoidosis progression or resolution, and to
develop database of these findings to further develop more precise, testable, models.

"In 2011, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) reported a 20% reduction in lung cancer
mortality for participants screened with low-dose CT (LDCT) as opposed to chest X-ray. Based
largely on these findings, LDCT lung screening is now a covered service for 8.7 million high-risk
current and former smokers in the United States. For high-risk individuals younger than 65,
insurance coverage is mandated under the Affordable Care Act; for those 65 and over
screening is covered by Medicare. Medicare covers lung screening only if patients are enrolled
in a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-approved lung screening registry. The
American College of Radiology Lung Cancer Screening Registry (ACR-LCSR) is the only
registry currently approved by CMS. Although most medical societies have endorsed CT for
lung cancer screening, the American Academy of Family Physicians concluded that the
evidence was insufficient to recommend either for or against lung screening, as the results of
the NLST had not been replicated in a community setting. Concerns regarding the
dissemination of lung screening focus on 1) the high rate of false positive (FP) screens, for
which participants receive a positive screening result and require additional testing, but do not
have lung cancer, 2) the relatively high rate of potentially clinically important significant
incidental findings (SIFs) detected at lung screening that are unrelated to lung cancer, and 3)
potential harms from the diagnostic evaluation of these FP and SIF abnormalities. It is unclear
whether the rate of FPs and SIFs seen in the NLST, will be replicated in community practice, as
opposed to a clinical trial setting. Higher rates of FPs and SIFs in the community or inefficient
diagnostic evaluation may result in delayed cancer diagnosis, excessive testing, iatrogenic
complications due to unnecessary testing, or decreased cost-effectiveness of lung screening in
the community, as opposed to the NLST. For the proposed research, we plan to: 1) compare
the rate and type of abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer and the rate and type of SIFs in
the ACR-LCSR community registry data as opposed to the NLST, 2) compare the diagnostic
pathways used to assess these abnormalities in the community as opposed to the NLST, and 3)
use a decision-tree cost-effectiveness analysis to compare community lung screening with
NLST cost-effectiveness assumptions with respect to rates of lung and SIF abnormalities and
diagnostic pathways; and to identify most cost-effective diagnostic pathways for each type of

mortality for participants screened with low-dose CT (LDCT) as opposed to chest X-ray. Based
largely on these findings, LDCT lung screening is now a covered service for 8.7 million high-risk
current and former smokers in the United States. For high-risk individuals younger than 65,
insurance coverage is mandated under the Affordable Care Act; for those 65 and over
screening is covered by Medicare. Medicare covers lung screening only if patients are enrolled
in a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-approved lung screening registry. The
American College of Radiology Lung Cancer Screening Registry (ACR-LCSR) is the only
registry currently approved by CMS. Although most medical societies have endorsed CT for
lung cancer screening, the American Academy of Family Physicians concluded that the
evidence was insufficient to recommend either for or against lung screening, as the results of
the NLST had not been replicated in a community setting. Concerns regarding the
dissemination of lung screening focus on 1) the high rate of false positive (FP) screens, for
which participants receive a positive screening result and require additional testing, but do not
have lung cancer, 2) the relatively high rate of potentially clinically important significant
incidental findings (SIFs) detected at lung screening that are unrelated to lung cancer, and 3)
potential harms from the diagnostic evaluation of these FP and SIF abnormalities. It is unclear
whether the rate of FPs and SIFs seen in the NLST, will be replicated in community practice, as
opposed to a clinical trial setting. Higher rates of FPs and SIFs in the community or inefficient
diagnostic evaluation may result in delayed cancer diagnosis, excessive testing, iatrogenic
complications due to unnecessary testing, or decreased cost-effectiveness of lung screening in
the community, as opposed to the NLST. For the proposed research, we plan to: 1) compare
the rate and type of abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer and the rate and type of SIFs in
the ACR-LCSR community registry data as opposed to the NLST, 2) compare the diagnostic
pathways used to assess these abnormalities in the community as opposed to the NLST, and 3)
use a decision-tree cost-effectiveness analysis to compare community lung screening with
NLST cost-effectiveness assumptions with respect to rates of lung and SIF abnormalities and
diagnostic pathways; and to identify most cost-effective diagnostic pathways for each type of
abnormality. This information is of vital importance to ensure that the reduction in lung cancer
mortality reported by the NLST is achieved in the community setting.",10165656,R01CA215240,['R01CA215240'],CA,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10165656,R01,2021,509518
"Project Summary
The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented an unprecedented crisis and challenge
to public health, with tremendous health care and economic burden to our society. Given the high morbidity of
this new disease and increasing findings on COVID-associated complications, it has emerged as an important
and urgent clinical need to investigate the sequelae in patients recovered from COVID-19 (post-COVID patients),
particularly with respect to residual long-term lung damage such as post-COVID decline of pulmonary function
and/or development of lung structure abnormality. This will ensure that the long-term outcomes of post-COVID
patients can be studied, better understood, and properly managed. At present, Computed Tomography (CT) is
the gold standard for imaging lung anatomy, but its radiation burden precludes frequent longitudinal evaluations.
Pulmonary function is currently evaluated by spirometry or plethysmography, which provide global measures of
function but this is inadequate for assessing the extent of disease heterogeneity. The overarching aim of this
application is to develop novel rapid free-breathing four-dimensional (4D=3D+motion) lung MRI techniques that
will enable frequent evaluation of lung anatomy and function in the longitudinal follow-ups of post-COVID patients.
These new methods will be based on a combination of compressed sensing and golden-angle radial acquisition,
with incorporation of the latest advances in deep learning, which are all pioneered by our research team.
Specifically, we propose to develop, optimize and evaluate a 10-minute free-breathing lung MRI protocol that
will enable one-stop-shop characterization of whole lung anatomy and spatially-resolved pulmonary function
without administration of contrast media. The overall hypothesis is that the proposed 4D MRI techniques can
serve as a potential radiation-free alternative to CT for longitudinal evaluation of lung structure change and a
better alternative to spirometry for deriving regional function parameters that could provide additional novel
insights into the heterogeneity of lung ventilation and associated lung diseases. Our proposal includes the
following three specific aims: (i) development of motion-resolved 4D UTE-MRI (MRI with ultra-shot echo times)
for submillimeter resolution free-breathing whole-lung imaging, (ii) development of deep breathing-based 4D
UTE-MRI for deriving global/regional pulmonary function parameters, and (iii) development of deep learning-
based lung segmentation for efficient and automated estimation of pulmonary function parameters. Successful
completion of this project will deliver non-invasive, non-contrast-enhanced, and free-breathing 4D MRI
techniques for rapid assessment of lung anatomy and pulmonary function. Given the overwhelming prevalence
of COVID-19 and the overall cumulative incidence in the United States, our novel imaging methods would provide
a unique opportunity to augment post-COVID care, particularly for identifying COVID-19-induced lung fibrosis in
a timely manner and for studying the longitudinal changes of lung anatomy and global/regional pulmonary
function.

"Project Summary/Abstract
Lung cancer 5-year survival rates drop from 61% for early stage diagnosis to just 6% for late stage diagnosis.
Currently, fewer than 1 in 5 cases are diagnosed at an early stage. The increasing frequency of chest CT scans
and changes in lung cancer screening guidelines are expected to increase the number of incidentally discovered
lung lesions, representing an opportunity for earlier lung cancer diagnosis. Bronchoscopy is currently the safest,
least invasive, and least expensive diagnostic option, but its poor diagnostic yield greatly limits its procedural
beneﬁt. Even when advanced techniques like radial endobronchial ultrasound and electromagnetic navigation
are used, the diagnostic yield is just 50-60%. This is primarily due to challenges with intraoperative localization
of the bronchoscope prior to needle deployment. Additionally, access to these techniques is limited because they
require expensive equipment and unique expertise. Efforts relying on the bronchoscope's built-in camera require
no additional equipment or specialization, but have struggled with generalizability across individuals in part due
to limited data availability and assumptions about airway features.
 The objective of this proposal is to improve the success rate of traditional bronchoscopes by addressing limita-
tions in intraoperative localization using a data-driven model that is robust to differences in human anatomy. This
work has potential for signiﬁcant public health beneﬁt by (1) increasing early lung cancer detection, (2) reducing
morbidity and mortality by reducing the number of invasive procedures, and (3) making minimally invasive bron-
choscopy more accessible in areas without expert bronchoscopists. The proposed work will be accomplished via
two Speciﬁc Aims. In Aim 1, a dataset will be generated of virtual and real bronchoscopy videos with video-frame
matched six degrees-of-freedom poses (position and orientation in three-dimensions) of the bronchoscope's dis-
tal tip. This data will be made publicly available as the ﬁrst large dataset of its kind to promote future research and
reproducibility. In Aim 2, a real-time bronchoscope localization model will be developed using advances in ma-
chine learning, including deep neural networks, that have shown success in camera localization for non-medical
applications. These models will regress the pose of the bronchoscope's distal tip using current and past video
frames of the bronchoscope's built-in camera. The clinical utility of the system will be evaluated in simulation, 3D
printed lung phantoms, and ex-vivo porcine lung experiments. The research, tightly coupled clinical experience,
and associated training plan will provide a unique interdisciplinary skill-set in computer science, medical robotics,

"ABSTRACT
There is increasing evidence that the evolution of cancer is strongly dependent on the complex tumor
microenvironment (TME) in which it develops. Despite the important roles of both microbiota and immune cells
within TME, there are huge gaps in linking specific lung-residing microbiota changes with immune cell
subpopulations. To date, no human lung cancer studies have been performed to characterize the host-pathogen
dynamic changes and dissecting the microbiome-immune interaction in an integrated manner.
We hypothesize that the dysbiosis of lung-residing microbe (microbiota expression changes) triggers
dysregulated balance in the lung immune system (immune cells infiltration levels), which results in an
inflammatory TME, and further promotes lung tumorigenesis and tumor progression. We propose to capitalize
on existing RNA-Seq (tumor and adjacent tissue) from 200 early-stage (I–IIIA) lung adenocarcinoma patients,
from a Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) study (discovery, n = 100) and a Harvard School of Public Health study
(external validation, n = 100), with no cost to this application. Our goal is to reveal the impact of the lung
microbiota on host immune cell profiles and how their interaction contributes to tumorigenesis and tumor
progression. To accomplish our goals, we will utilize a Dual RNA-Seq analytical approach: 1) to identity
intratumoral metatranscriptomic signatures, and 2) to characterize immune infiltration profiles and microbiome-
immune interaction. Specifically, the unmapped quality-filtered RNA reads (non-human, putative microbial reads)
aligned to microbial reference transcriptomes will be used for metatranscriptome analysis (Aim 1); whereas reads
that map to human reference will be used for computational immune profiling analysis (Aim 2).
This is the first study to simultaneously profile lung tissue-specific microbiota expression and immune infiltrates
in lung adenocarcinoma. This project could contribute significantly to our understanding of the biological
processes before/during (adjacent/tumor tissue) lung adenocarcinoma development, in particular the complex
microbiome-immune interaction. Elucidating the nature of interactions between lung microbiome and immune
cells comprising the TME could guide the development of novel therapeutic interventions.

"Project Abstract
 Although Wedge Resection Surgery results in better lung function, tumor recurrence rate is almost
double that of lobectomy, with significantly poorer 5-year survival rates. This may be attributed to the difficulty
in accurately localizing and resecting the nodules in a deflated lung. Currently, there is no effective method of
accurately localizing the nodules and guiding the surgical stapling device to the optimal resection margin. The
long-term goal of this research is to investigate algorithms and technologies to manage lung nodules from
diagnosis to surgical resection. The objective of this proposal is to design and develop a lung navigation
(LungNav) system to localize and excise, with sufficient margin, small and early malignant lung nodules. The
experimental methods will be to design and develop the LungNav system integrated with an active nodule
tracker called J-bar, machine learning algorithms for determining the optimal resection margin, and tracked
surgical stapling device for accurately excising the nodule. Tumor deformation algorithms and augmented
reality displays will be developed to visualize the nodule on thoracosopy videos and guide the surgical stapler
in real-time to the optimal margin. The hypothesis is that by anchoring the J-bar close to the nodule, the nodule
position can be accurately tracked in real-time despite significant tissue deformation when the lung is collapsed
and manipulated during surgery. To achieve the goals of this project, we will pursue the following specific aims:
1) Design and develop the nodule tracker (J-bar) and deformation algorithms to estimate the real-time position
of the nodule. 2) Investigate a machine-learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to
determine the optimal resection margin. 3) Design and develop a software navigation module, called LungNav,
for visualizing the tumor and navigating the surgical stapler to the optimal resection margin. 4) Validate the
design and performance of the LungNav system using ex-vivo lung tissue and live porcine models. The
proposed research is significant since it addresses an important problem, which potentially affects several
thousand patients each year, of accurately localizing and resecting lung nodules while preserving healthy lung
function. The research is innovative since it builds on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, navigation
systems and augmented reality methods to accurately diagnose and localize the nodule in presence of
significant tissue deformation. The expected outcome of the project is the development of CNN-based machine
learning algorithms for lung nodule classification and a LungNav system with tumor deformation algorithms and

"Project Summary:
Improved survival in persons living with HIV (PLWH) has led to a higher prevalence of several chronic illnesses
including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which affects an estimated 3-23%. A major gap in
knowledge is the inability to identify those at risk and a limited understanding of why HIV increases COPD risk
independent of smoking status. In our recent published report, we identified 172 unique plasma analytes that
differentiated HIV+ individuals with COPD compared to their HIV+ matched controls. We identified 17 of these
metabolites to be lipids by LC-MS/MS, including diacylglycerol and several sphingolipids. Sphingolipids are
important participants in cell signaling and function as a rheostat balancing cell proliferation, pro- and anti-
apoptotic states and the inflammatory process. In HIV negative individuals with COPD, sphingolipids,
particularly ceramide, are linked to COPD pathogenesis and serve as putative biomarkers of disease. We
propose to build upon our previous work and leverage our sample repositories to define the molecular
signature of PLWH en route to developing COPD and uncover underlying mechanisms of disease. We
hypothesize that a unique lipid biosignature is associated with HIV-COPD susceptibility in PLWH and
is directly linked to pathogenesis.
In this proposed research project, we will use state-of-the-art metabolomic and proteomic approaches
to determine the relationship between lipid profiles with accelerated lung function decline in HIV. Our
research takes advantage of our team's expertise (biomarker discovery in COPD; metabolomics and
computational analysis; COPD in HIV infection) and the unique opportunity presented by the Pittsburgh Lung
HIV, Vancouver Lung HIV and Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Treatment (START) cohorts. Our first approach
is to identify lung specific lipid profiles associated with HIV-COPD using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples
from the well-phenotyped Pittsburg and Vancouver cohorts. We anticipate from our published work that many
of the plasma lipids associated with HIV-COPD will be lung specific. To unravel key canonical pathways and
biological processes linked to HIV-COPD we will employ a hypothesis-driven proteomic-based approach
comprising data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) with Sequential Windowed Acquisition
of All Theoretical Fragment Ion Mass Spectra (SWATH-MS) of BAL, with data analysis including gene
ontology. Downstream signaling pathways of sphingolipids, such as cell proliferation, pro- and anti-apoptotic
states and the inflammatory process, will serve as our hypothesis-driven focus. We will then validate lung
specific lipid profiles that are present in plasma and predict accelerated lung function decline using plasma
samples from the 1,026 START subjects in our longitudinal spirometry substudy.

knowledge is the inability to identify those at risk and a limited understanding of why HIV increases COPD risk
independent of smoking status. In our recent published report, we identified 172 unique plasma analytes that
differentiated HIV+ individuals with COPD compared to their HIV+ matched controls. We identified 17 of these
metabolites to be lipids by LC-MS/MS, including diacylglycerol and several sphingolipids. Sphingolipids are
important participants in cell signaling and function as a rheostat balancing cell proliferation, pro- and anti-
apoptotic states and the inflammatory process. In HIV negative individuals with COPD, sphingolipids,
particularly ceramide, are linked to COPD pathogenesis and serve as putative biomarkers of disease. We
propose to build upon our previous work and leverage our sample repositories to define the molecular
signature of PLWH en route to developing COPD and uncover underlying mechanisms of disease. We
hypothesize that a unique lipid biosignature is associated with HIV-COPD susceptibility in PLWH and
is directly linked to pathogenesis.
In this proposed research project, we will use state-of-the-art metabolomic and proteomic approaches
to determine the relationship between lipid profiles with accelerated lung function decline in HIV. Our
research takes advantage of our team's expertise (biomarker discovery in COPD; metabolomics and
computational analysis; COPD in HIV infection) and the unique opportunity presented by the Pittsburgh Lung
HIV, Vancouver Lung HIV and Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Treatment (START) cohorts. Our first approach
is to identify lung specific lipid profiles associated with HIV-COPD using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples
from the well-phenotyped Pittsburg and Vancouver cohorts. We anticipate from our published work that many
of the plasma lipids associated with HIV-COPD will be lung specific. To unravel key canonical pathways and
biological processes linked to HIV-COPD we will employ a hypothesis-driven proteomic-based approach
comprising data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) with Sequential Windowed Acquisition
of All Theoretical Fragment Ion Mass Spectra (SWATH-MS) of BAL, with data analysis including gene
ontology. Downstream signaling pathways of sphingolipids, such as cell proliferation, pro- and anti-apoptotic
states and the inflammatory process, will serve as our hypothesis-driven focus. We will then validate lung
specific lipid profiles that are present in plasma and predict accelerated lung function decline using plasma
samples from the 1,026 START subjects in our longitudinal spirometry substudy.",10169496,R01HL140971,['R01HL140971'],HL,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10169496,R01,2021,667118
"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background and long-term objectives: This proposed research will advance our understanding of how the
lung microbiome contributes to the pathogenesis and perpetuation of oxygen-induced lung injury. Inhaled
oxygen is among our most commonly administered therapies. Yet hyperoxia - elevated inspired oxygen -
causes lethal lung injury in animals, and in humans is associated with increased mortality and development of
the acute respiratory distress syndrome. We have recently discovered that hyperoxia acutely alters lung
microbiota. This oxygen-induced dysbiosis is strongly and temporally correlated with alveolar inflammation. We
have discovered that germ-free mice - experimental mice devoid of microbiota - are protected from oxygen-
induced lung injury, an observation that cannot be explained via our conventional model of oxygen-induced
lung injury. Conversely, lung injury alters lung microbiota by changing bacterial growth conditions within the
lung microenvironment. We have discovered that germ-free mice are protected from non-resolving lung injury
(bleomycin), indicating that the microbiome is necessary for perpetuation of lung injury. The discovery of the
lung microbiome has thus broadened our model of pathogenesis. The mechanisms by which lung microbiota
mediate oxygen-induced lung injury, and are in turn altered by lung injury, are undetermined.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that specific bacteria within the lung ecosystem propel alveolar
inflammation in oxygen-induced lung injury, and these bacteria are enriched within the lung microbiome both
by hyperoxia itself and by the altered ecology of injured lungs. The rationale is that these discoveries will
facilitate the development of therapies for the prevention and treatment of oxygen-related human lung disease.
Specific Aim 1: To determine the microbial and molecular pathways by which oxygen therapy alters
lung microbiota, mediating host inflammation and injury. We will accomplish this Aim by integrating
complementary experimental approaches: in vivo heterogeneity analysis of host-microbiome interactions in
mice; in vivo germ-free, gnotobiotic, and antibiotic-treated hyperoxia modeling in mice; data science
interrogation of observational human data using a validated machine-learning algorithm.
Specific Aim 2: To determine the molecular pathways by which oxygen-induced host inflammation and
injury alter lung microbiota, perpetuating respiratory dysbiosis and lung injury. We will accomplish this
Aim by integrating complementary experimental approaches: a novel ex vivo culture assay that identifies host-
derived mediators of bacterial growth; in vivo augmentation and inhibition of the host response in hyperoxia.
This translational research approach will determine 1) the key members of the lung microbiome that mediate
oxygen-induced lung injury, 2) the pathways by which these bacteria promote alveolar inflammation, and 3) the
ecologic factors within the injured lung environment that promote their growth.

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Early detection of lung cancer among asymptomatic individuals is a priority for reducing mortality of the number
one cancer killer worldwide. Most lung cancers are first detected as indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs).
While the vast majority of IPNs are benign, those malignant ones present with specific features that should allow
for the early discrimination and intervention. We have recently completed a study demonstrating the value of
structural imaging features analysis in providing improved accuracy in detection of cancers among IPNs with
accuracy of over 90% trained in the NLST and validated in two independent cohorts. The AUC increased from
baseline risk estimate of disease using clinical parameters (Mayo model) 0.78 to 0.84 and from 0.82 to 0.92 in
two independent validation cohorts. Similarly, we tested the added value of our high sensitivity hsCYFRA 21-1
assay in three populations of lung nodules and obtained similar added value to the MAYO model. Finally, we
identified signatures predictive of lung cancer using large scale data mining in the electronic health record (EHR).
The performance of the performance of the established imaging predictor, hsCYFRA concentrations and EHR
trajectories will be validated in a prospective cohort. In an innovative partnership between pulmonary oncology,
radiology, machine learning, and data science experts at Vanderbilt, we propose to integrate the layer of clinical
information accessible in the EHR to improve the noninvasive diagnosis accuracy. In addition, we propose to
take advantage of repeated measures to improve the accuracy of the prediction of cancer and to reduce the time
to diagnosis. We therefore propose the following aims. In Aim 1 we will validate advanced quantitative imaging
analyses to distinguish early benign from malignant IPNs based on repeated measures of 1000 individuals. In
Aim 2. We will test in 150 individuals with lung nodules the added value of repeated measures of hsCYFRA 21-
1 protein blood biomarker in diagnostic accuracy over the baseline concentrations of the biomarker. In Aim 3 we
will test a deep learning strategy from the EHR of 20,000 patients from VUMC to identify patterns likely to improve
the early detection of lung cancer, and in Aim 4 we will test the added value of monitoring changes in levels of
the markers for early detection using repeated pre-diagnosis chest CT studies, serum analysis of hsCYFRA 21-
1, and EHR patterns from our lung cancer screening program. Built upon strong preliminary data and unique
resources from VUMC that include access to large imaging and HER data sources this novel integrative study
has the potential to generate highly impactful and translatable results to reduce false positive rates among IPNs,
and morbidity and mortality from lung cancer. This application responds to PAR 19-264 using low-dose lung
screening computed tomography longitudinal analysis integrated with a lead serum biomarker and the power of
artificial intelligence to mine the EHR for the discovery of a novel integrative strategy for the early detection of
premetastatic lung cancer.

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Large-scale genomic studies have discovered numerous relevant alterations that activate or inactivate key
signaling molecules in lung cancer, which led to significant improvement on patients' outcome and our
therapeutic options. Despite these advances in the genome-based precision medicine, the 5-year survival rate
of 18% remains less than adequate. This is attributable to eventual emergence of resistance and variability in
response to the treatment, largely due to heterogeneity of lung cancers. To improve precision and efficacy,
innovative strategies to distinguish different subgroups of lung cancer by additional features for future drug
development are desperately needed. We hypothesize that our natural system to populate necessary cells to
constitute the organ structure and its function is hijacked by cancer mimicking normal cell identities to maintain
their survival. Our previous studies found lung cancer cells harboring amplification of lineage oncogenes are
specifically dependent on their expression for survival. The need for lineage amplified genes in a subset of
cancers suggests unique vulnerabilities in cancer cells that may be poised at the brink of survival. However,
these amplifications represent only a minor subset of the two major subtypes of lung cancers. Therefore, this
study will focus on lineage factors essential during the development and control the cell identity in adult, in the
remaining subsets of lung cancers. Through genome-wide profiling of a histone mark, we identified `super-
enhancers' (SE) on the lineage-defining transcription factor genes. Subsequent hierarchical clustering of lung
cancer samples identified SEs specific to subsets of lung cancers. Therefore, we aim to understand the
significance of our lead candidates defining the lineage state of the novel subsets in aim 1. We will test the
subclass-specific local chromatin structure and then investigate the roles of novel lineage transcription factors
specifically enriched in the two major subgroups of lung ADCs, whether they are essential for maintaining the
cellular state of lung cancer cells and are dependent on the committed lineage for their survival. In aim 2, to
determine the roles of a neural transcription factor Brn2 in a novel `neural' subtype of lung squamous cell
cancers (SCC) as a cooperative partner of Sox2, by contrast to p63, a key squamous lineage factor we
previously characterized as an important cooperative partner of Sox2 in classic lung SCC. In aim 3, to pursue
inducing transdifferentiation as a therapeutic strategy, we seek to understand how lineage switch occurs within
a tumor by determining heterogeneity and dynamics of lineage states. We will determine the mode of temporal
dynamics of population shifts in lineage states induced by genetic perturbation in defined models via profiling
genome-wide chromatin landscapes at a single cell level. We will then test our hypothesis that the degree of
heterogeneity correlates with plasticity of the tumor and aggressive tumor behaviors using a mouse model and
human specimens. The results will serve as a proof-of-principle how these lineage factors contribute to the
formation of lung cancer and lead to new hypotheses how we can manipulate cell identity of lung cancers.

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In this application for a 5-year K23 Career Development Award, I propose mentored research and career
development leading to a career as an independent clinical and translational investigator in interstitial lung
disease (ILD). The goal of this project is to identify the role of body composition in frailty among subjects with
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The prevalence of IPF is rising, currently affecting 1 in 200 older adults. There
is no cure for IPF. The only available medications slow disease progression but do not reverse disease. Frailty
affects up to 50% of IPF patients, and is characterized by decreased physiologic reserve and increased
susceptibility to severe manifestations of acute insults. The most common causes of death in IPF are acute
insults. Frailty is thus a potentially modifiable risk factor for morbidity and mortality in IPF.
This proposal builds on my preliminary work showing that (1) greater visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is associated
with increased frailty, (2) subjects with both sarcopenia and visceral obesity are at greater risk of frailty than
those with sarcopenia alone, (3) there may be distinct endotypes of exercise limitation defined by high
inflammation alone or low inflammation with high VAT, and (4) down-regulation of the growth hormone (GH) axis
may link VAT and frailty. Under the mentorship of Dr. R Graham Barr, I propose to evaluate the roles of body
composition by bioelectrical impedance assay (co-mentor Gallagher), inflammation, and neuroendocrine
dysregulation associated with frailty risk using a machine-learning approach (co-mentor Valeri). I will also
evaluate the role of growth hormone axis dysregulation in sarcopenia with visceral obesity in a rigorous overnight
protocol (co-mentor Freda). I propose to perform this in two NHLBI-funded prospective cohorts: Dr. Garcia’s
Families-At-Risk for ILD (R01HL103676) and Dr. Singer’s Advanced Lung Disease Lung Transplantation Study
(R01HL134851).
With guidance from my mentors, I have crafted a 5-year career development plan that includes training in body
composition analysis (Dr. Gallagher), measurement of complex endocrine systems (Dr. Freda), clinical trials (Dr.
Freda), biostatistics (Dr. Valeri), aging in interstitial lung disease (Dr. Garcia), and epidemiology (Dr. Barr). In the
last two years of this award, I will apply for R01 funding and transition to independence. The proposed activities
will prepare me to conduct patient-oriented research to evaluate the role of body composition in outcomes in
ILD. I will also acquire the skills and training required to design and conduct clinical trials targeting novel
pathways to prevent and treat frailty in ILD.

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Screening promotes early detection of cancer to decrease mortality. Unfortunately, significant racial disparities
exist in lung cancer screening. Recently published findings by our team show that under current national
screening guidelines African Americans have reduced eligibility for lung cancer screening compared to whites.
These screening guidelines are based on a combination of age and smoking pack-year criteria derived from a
national lung screening trial that was primarily (91%) white. Importantly, smoking behaviors and baseline risks
for lung cancer differ greatly between African Americans and whites. Because of this, a risk-based screening
strategy may provide a more equitable assessment of eligibility than current screening guidelines. However, the
development of personalized risk prediction models for lung cancer in African Americans has been limited. To
address this gap and to improve equity in screening eligibility, we propose building a personalized prediction tool
using the combined data from three large-scale population-based prospective cohorts with substantial African
American representation. The combined cohorts have over 336,000 individuals (44% African American) and
9,132 incident lung cancer cases from across the United States. We propose the following three aims: 1)
construct a well-calibrated natural-history model of lung cancer risk for screening in African Americans, 2)
evaluate lung cancer screening strategies by simulation and identify sub-populations who would benefit from
screening, accounting for comorbidities and false-positives, and 3) develop a web-based decision aid for
screening that is culturally appropriate. We will employ innovative machine learning techniques and state-of-the-
art statistical methods to build a well-calibrated lung cancer prediction model for African Americans. Careful
examination will identify sub-populations (such as women, low socioeconomic status, rural, age groups, etc.)
that will benefit from screening. A key innovative aspect of this proposal is its community-engaged approach and
partnership with a Community Advisory Board, both of which will help translate our empirical findings into the
design of a patient-oriented decision aid. This project is relevant to the mission of the National Cancer Institute
since it focuses on establishing equity in lung cancer screening eligibility. Our findings will have sustained impact

Screening promotes early detection of cancer to decrease mortality. Unfortunately, significant racial disparities
exist in lung cancer screening. Recently published findings by our team show that under current national
screening guidelines African Americans have reduced eligibility for lung cancer screening compared to whites.
These screening guidelines are based on a combination of age and smoking pack-year criteria derived from a
national lung screening trial that was primarily (91%) white. Importantly, smoking behaviors and baseline risks
for lung cancer differ greatly between African Americans and whites. Because of this, a risk-based screening
strategy may provide a more equitable assessment of eligibility than current screening guidelines. However, the
development of personalized risk prediction models for lung cancer in African Americans has been limited. To
address this gap and to improve equity in screening eligibility, we propose building a personalized prediction tool
using the combined data from three large-scale population-based prospective cohorts with substantial African
American representation. The combined cohorts have over 336,000 individuals (44% African American) and
9,132 incident lung cancer cases from across the United States. We propose the following three aims: 1)
construct a well-calibrated natural-history model of lung cancer risk for screening in African Americans, 2)
evaluate lung cancer screening strategies by simulation and identify sub-populations who would benefit from
screening, accounting for comorbidities and false-positives, and 3) develop a web-based decision aid for
screening that is culturally appropriate. We will employ innovative machine learning techniques and state-of-the-
art statistical methods to build a well-calibrated lung cancer prediction model for African Americans. Careful
examination will identify sub-populations (such as women, low socioeconomic status, rural, age groups, etc.)
that will benefit from screening. A key innovative aspect of this proposal is its community-engaged approach and
partnership with a Community Advisory Board, both of which will help translate our empirical findings into the
design of a patient-oriented decision aid. This project is relevant to the mission of the National Cancer Institute
since it focuses on establishing equity in lung cancer screening eligibility. Our findings will have sustained impact
on precision health and motivate improved clinical strategies for the early detection of lung cancer for African
Americans.",10210043,R01CA251758,['R01CA251758'],CA,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10210043,R01,2021,658582
"PROJECT SUMMARY
Large-scale genomic studies have discovered numerous relevant alterations that activate or inactivate key
signaling molecules in lung cancer, which led to significant improvement on patients' outcome and our
therapeutic options. Despite these advances in the genome-based precision medicine, the 5-year survival rate
of 18% remains less than adequate. This is attributable to eventual emergence of resistance and variability in
response to the treatment, largely due to heterogeneity of lung cancers. To improve precision and efficacy,
innovative strategies to distinguish different subgroups of lung cancer by additional features for future drug
development are desperately needed. We hypothesize that our natural system to populate necessary cells to
constitute the organ structure and its function is hijacked by cancer mimicking normal cell identities to maintain
their survival. Our previous studies found lung cancer cells harboring amplification of lineage oncogenes are
specifically dependent on their expression for survival. The need for lineage amplified genes in a subset of
cancers suggests unique vulnerabilities in cancer cells that may be poised at the brink of survival. However,
these amplifications represent only a minor subset of the two major subtypes of lung cancers. Therefore, this
study will focus on lineage factors essential during the development and control the cell identity in adult, in the
remaining subsets of lung cancers. Through genome-wide profiling of a histone mark, we identified `super-
enhancers' (SE) on the lineage-defining transcription factor genes. Subsequent hierarchical clustering of lung
cancer samples identified SEs specific to subsets of lung cancers. Therefore, we aim to understand the
significance of our lead candidates defining the lineage state of the novel subsets in aim 1. We will test the
subclass-specific local chromatin structure and then investigate the roles of novel lineage transcription factors
specifically enriched in the two major subgroups of lung ADCs, whether they are essential for maintaining the
cellular state of lung cancer cells and are dependent on the committed lineage for their survival. In aim 2, to
determine the roles of a neural transcription factor Brn2 in a novel `neural' subtype of lung squamous cell
cancers (SCC) as a cooperative partner of Sox2, by contrast to p63, a key squamous lineage factor we
previously characterized as an important cooperative partner of Sox2 in classic lung SCC. In aim 3, to pursue
inducing transdifferentiation as a therapeutic strategy, we seek to understand how lineage switch occurs within
a tumor by determining heterogeneity and dynamics of lineage states. We will determine the mode of temporal
dynamics of population shifts in lineage states induced by genetic perturbation in defined models via profiling
genome-wide chromatin landscapes at a single cell level. We will then test our hypothesis that the degree of
heterogeneity correlates with plasticity of the tumor and aggressive tumor behaviors using a mouse model and
human specimens. The results will serve as a proof-of-principle how these lineage factors contribute to the
formation of lung cancer and lead to new hypotheses how we can manipulate cell identity of lung cancers.

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes conditions such as emphysema, is the fourth
leading cause of death in the United States. Although progression of COPD can be slowed through lifestyle
changes, the disease is incurable. New treatment/management options emerged recently when the FDA
approved endobronchial valves (EBV) as a Breakthrough Device for the treatment of severe COPD. EBVs
provide a new treatment pathway but their implantation is associated with morbidity and mortality risks. In
addition, not every patient who undergoes implantation has demonstrated the expected benefits from the device.
Trial data indicate that imaging data can be used to help identify patients in whom an EBV will be effective,
showing specifically that effectiveness increases in patients with heterogeneous COPD with complete fissures
in the targeted lobes. The EBV is officially indicated for “severe emphysema in regions of the lung that have little
to no collateral ventilation,” but interpretation of these criteria is imprecise and qualitative. The goal of this
proposal is to develop more unified, robust, and quantitative criteria that will more successfully identify
patients that are likely to respond to EBV implantation. The three most predictive variables identified by
clinical trials to date have been the degree of severity of COPD, the heterogeneity of COPD between adjacent
lobes and fissure completeness, all of which can be assessed by CT imaging. However, quantification of COPD
severity can be confounded by the CT acquisition and reconstruction parameter selections used in the imaging
protocol. These can also affect the ability to assess fissure completeness. In addition, traditional measures of
COPD severity (i.e. Emphysema score) do not distinguish lung destruction from airtrapping, which may be
important in assessing whether a patient is a good candidate for an EBV. In this proposal, we will investigate
methods to standardize CT imaging data that would allow for more robust quantitative image analysis and apply
the resulting methods to develop a more robust criteria for patient selection for the application of EBV devices.
Therefore, our Specific Aims are: (1) To develop methods for robust, quantitative CT estimates of lung
density and the Fissure Integrity Score (FIS). This will involve the application of methods to account for
differences in CT scanners and acquisition/reconstruction parameters as well as machine learning methods to
more accurately assess lung fissure integrity; (2) To develop and test an EBV predictive model using
improved measures. Using the improved estimates of lung density and FIS from aim 1, we will develop and
test a predictive model that distinguishes EBV responders from non-responders; and (3) To extend the EBV
Prediction Model to incorporate additional biomarkers. We will extend the EBV scoring model by
investigating other biomarkers that may provide complementary information, such as distinguishing airtrapping
from COPD and an assessment of lung vascularity. We evaluate the ability of this extended model to improve
our ability to distinguish EBV responders from non-responders.

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
As increasing numbers of children with HIV are surviving to adolescence in low- and middle-income countries,
chronic lung disease (CLD) has emerged as an important but poorly understood complication amongst
adolescents and young adults living with HIV (ALWH). In the ongoing, longitudinal BREATHE II Study (K23
HL129888, PI Attia) in Nairobi, Kenya, 19% of 162 ALWH have abnormal spirometry compared to 11% of 162
uninfected participants; 59% of ALWH have ≥1 abnormality on high-resolution chest CT scan, with mosaic
attenuation among the most common. Chronic respiratory symptoms are also highly prevalent among 62% of
ALWH and 49% of uninfected participants. HIV is independently associated with impaired lung function, and
risk factors for impaired spirometry among ALWH include inhaled exposures, such as secondhand smoke and
ambient fine particulate matter, as well as growth deficits. Objectives of the K23 research include: examining
differences in risk factors and mechanisms of CLD progression over time; determining the role of HIV infection
on change in lung function over time, considering the complex interplay with other risk factors; and, evaluating
whether biomarkers of chronic immune activation and inflammation are associated with diminished lung
function growth over time. However, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, these longitudinal studies have been
halted for safety reasons. As these studies can now resume with added precautions, an Administrative
Supplement to this K23 will provide essential resources for the following Aims: 1) complete longitudinal lung
function and clinical data collection to conduct planned analyses as proposed in the parent K23; 2) add testing
for COVID-19 both to mitigate risk of potential spread of SARS-CoV-2 through spirometry (rapid PCR test) and
to examine the role of COVID-19 infection on lung function growth and development (serologic antibody test).
The indispensable support of this Supplement will maintain the BREATHE II cohort, a unique and innovative
resource for understanding CLD progression among ALWH, especially those with perinatal HIV acquisition,
compared to demographically similar uninfected participants from the same geographic catchment area in the
context of COVID-19. This cohort includes a dataset of chest CTs that is larger than in any published literature
to date. Serum for biomarker analysis (currently underway) has the potential to inform mechanistic pathways of
CLD. The study infrastructure is already supporting implementation of sub-studies to obtain quantitative
measures of air pollution exposure and to compare CLD in BREATHE II to a cohort of ALWH in a high-income
setting, and is a well-positioned platform to support future sub-studies. Findings of this research will provide
critical data for informing R01-level research to investigate novel insights into the pathophysiologic
mechanisms of CLD progression in ALWH in resource-limited settings, shedding light on risk factors and
mechanisms that can be targeted by preventative and therapeutic interventions to mitigate the burden of CLD. 2019-nCoV;Administrative Supplement;Adolescence;Adolescent;Adolescent and Young Adult;Adult;Aerosols;Air Pollution;Biological Markers;Bronchiolitis;COVID-19;COVID-19 pandemic;COVID-19 testing;COVID-19 vaccination;Catchment Area;Chest;Child;Chronic;Chronic lung disease;Clinical;Clinical Data;Communicable Diseases;Complex;Complication;Coughing;Country;Data;Data Collection;Data Set;Development;Diagnosis;Disease Progression;Exposure to;Forced expiratory volume function;Funding;Future;Geography;Growth;Growth and Development function;HIV;HIV Infections;Immune System Diseases;Immunologic Markers;Impairment;Income;Inflammation;Infrastructure;Inhalation Exposure;Intervention;Kenya;Light;Literature;Longitudinal Studies;Lung;Lung diseases;Lung infections;Machine Learning;Measures;Mosaicism;Natural History;Parents;Participant;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study;Phenotype;Population;Positioning Attribute;Procedures;Publishing;Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1;Pulmonary Pathology;Research;Resolution;Resources;Respiratory Signs and Symptoms;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;SARS-CoV-2 infection;Safety;Schedule;Serology;Serum;Spirometry;Statistical Data Interpretation;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;United States National Institutes of Health;Visit;Vulnerable Populations;Work;X-Ray Computed Tomography;antibody test;attenuation;base;chest computed tomography;cohort;environmental tobacco smoke;experience;fine particles;follow-up;immune activation;innovation;insight;low and middle-income countries;lung maturation;novel;perinatal HIV;personal protective equipment;preventive intervention;primary outcome;pulmonary function;respiratory;young adult Mechanisms & risk factors of chronic lung disease in HIV+ adolescents in Nairobi","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT

"SUMMARY:
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the United States with an estimated 140,000 deaths
in 2020. While it has been demonstrated that lung screening reduces the mortality by 20%, accurate classification
of malignant tumors remains an unmet need due to high rate of false positive cases. Current classification
approaches by means of computed tomography (CT) screenings are based on statistical predictive models, and
more recently artificial intelligence. Improving the classification accuracy of malignant tumors will reduce costs
and the risk of mortality and guide clinical decision making. Here, we propose a novel framework to further
improve the predictive power of current models by enriching the input information with biophysics-based
computational models. The proposed computational model generates orthogonal information, which is based on
laws of physics, and hence intrinsically unlearnable by artificial intelligence. We propose augmenting biophysical
information since numerous studies have demonstrated that the tumor progression is strongly affected by the
physical microenvironment in which they grow.
Our overall objective here is to propose the physiological mechanical forces in lung as an informative and
orthogonal biomarker to the existing input variables in state-of-the-art approaches to improve the prediction of
malignancy risk in pulmonary nodules. Our central hypothesis is that coupling a biophysics-based computational
model with the existing statistical models and artificial intelligence approaches will improve their prediction power
in classifying malignant pulmonary nodules. Our hypothesis is based on published works and our preliminary
data that the mechanical stresses in the lung are strongly correlated with both tumor incidence and growth. By
coupling biophysics-based computational model, we plan to evaluate the improved classification performance in
logistic regression model (Aim 1), as a highly interpretable model, and deep convolutional neural network (Aim
2), as a highly predictive model. Coupling biophysics-based computational model to artificial intelligence
predictive tools will improve the prediction of power at no added financial and health burden to the patient. This
novel approach, proposed here on lung cancer classification, has potential diagnostic and prognostic benefits in
other pathological lung conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), fibrosis, mechanical

"Our project proposes an academic-industrial partnership to translate a novel lung function imaging
modality into clinical care for lung cancer patients receiving radiation therapy. Lung cancer patients being treated
with radiation can experience serious and sometimes life threatening thoracic side effects from treatment. There
is emerging data demonstrating that a novel lung function imaging modality can reduce side-effects and improve
quality of life for lung cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. The novel lung function imaging modality,
referred to as ‘4DCT-ventilation,’ uses 4DCT data along with image processing techniques to innovatively
calculate lung ventilation maps. 4DCT-ventilation can improve outcomes for lung cancer patients by enabling
the generation of functional avoidance radiotherapy plans. Functional avoidance uses 4DCT-ventilation to avoid
functional portions of the lung, with the hypothesis that reducing dose to functional lung will reduce thoracic side-
effects. Our 4DCT-ventilation research has progressed from retrospective studies to an early-phase trial using
4DCT-ventilation for functional avoidance radiotherapy. The early promising toxicity results from 4DCT-
ventilation clinical trials is providing a strong rationale for national trials and expanded clinical integration across
individual clinics. The problem is that expanded clinical integration of 4DCT-ventilation is currently not possible
due to a lack of consistent, efficient, and clinically validated methods. We propose an academic-industry
partnership with MIM Software to address these challenges precluding clinical integration of 4DCT-ventilation.
 The purpose of our study is to develop methods that enable safe, efficient, and clinically validated
methods for clinical integration of 4DCT-ventilation functional avoidance. Our overarching hypothesis is that the
4DCT-ventilation functional avoidance innovations we develop will be demonstrated to reduce lung toxicity in
clinics with no prior 4DCT-ventilation experience. The project will be carried out in 3 aims. Aim 1 will develop
methods that enable automated 4DCT-ventilation calculations including auto-segmentation, statistically-robust
calculation methods, and clinically-efficient quality assurance tools. Aim 2 will develop methods for 4DCT-
ventilation functional avoidance radiotherapy including image heterogeneity assessment, development of
knowledge-based functional planning methods, and evaluation of metrics most critical in reducing toxicity. In
conjunction with our industry partner, the developed methods from Aims 1 and 2 will be integrated in a
commercial-grade software tool. Aim 3 will evaluate feasibility by assessing whether 4DCT-ventilation functional
avoidance can be demonstrated to reduce toxicity in clinics with no prior 4DCT-ventilation experience.
 Our project will generate both the tools and data needed to provide guidance on how to properly
incorporate 4DCT-ventilation into clinical care. The methods and data will culminate in a commercial-grade
platform suitable for busy clinics. 4DCT-ventilation has great potential to improve outcomes for lung cancer
patients and our project will enable the integration of this novel imaging modality into clinical care.

with radiation can experience serious and sometimes life threatening thoracic side effects from treatment. There
is emerging data demonstrating that a novel lung function imaging modality can reduce side-effects and improve
quality of life for lung cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. The novel lung function imaging modality,
referred to as ‘4DCT-ventilation,’ uses 4DCT data along with image processing techniques to innovatively
calculate lung ventilation maps. 4DCT-ventilation can improve outcomes for lung cancer patients by enabling
the generation of functional avoidance radiotherapy plans. Functional avoidance uses 4DCT-ventilation to avoid
functional portions of the lung, with the hypothesis that reducing dose to functional lung will reduce thoracic side-
effects. Our 4DCT-ventilation research has progressed from retrospective studies to an early-phase trial using
4DCT-ventilation for functional avoidance radiotherapy. The early promising toxicity results from 4DCT-
ventilation clinical trials is providing a strong rationale for national trials and expanded clinical integration across
individual clinics. The problem is that expanded clinical integration of 4DCT-ventilation is currently not possible
due to a lack of consistent, efficient, and clinically validated methods. We propose an academic-industry
partnership with MIM Software to address these challenges precluding clinical integration of 4DCT-ventilation.
 The purpose of our study is to develop methods that enable safe, efficient, and clinically validated
methods for clinical integration of 4DCT-ventilation functional avoidance. Our overarching hypothesis is that the
4DCT-ventilation functional avoidance innovations we develop will be demonstrated to reduce lung toxicity in
clinics with no prior 4DCT-ventilation experience. The project will be carried out in 3 aims. Aim 1 will develop
methods that enable automated 4DCT-ventilation calculations including auto-segmentation, statistically-robust
calculation methods, and clinically-efficient quality assurance tools. Aim 2 will develop methods for 4DCT-
ventilation functional avoidance radiotherapy including image heterogeneity assessment, development of
knowledge-based functional planning methods, and evaluation of metrics most critical in reducing toxicity. In
conjunction with our industry partner, the developed methods from Aims 1 and 2 will be integrated in a
commercial-grade software tool. Aim 3 will evaluate feasibility by assessing whether 4DCT-ventilation functional
avoidance can be demonstrated to reduce toxicity in clinics with no prior 4DCT-ventilation experience.
 Our project will generate both the tools and data needed to provide guidance on how to properly
incorporate 4DCT-ventilation into clinical care. The methods and data will culminate in a commercial-grade
platform suitable for busy clinics. 4DCT-ventilation has great potential to improve outcomes for lung cancer
patients and our project will enable the integration of this novel imaging modality into clinical care.",10066325,R01CA236857,['R01CA236857'],CA,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10066325,R01,2021,75749
"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal for a K08 Award is motivated by two overarching goals: 1) to support the scientific and professional
development of the candidate, Dr. Paul Reyfman, towards achieving his career goal of succeeding as a physician
scientist and independent investigator with expertise in systems biology approaches applied to the study of
chronic lung disease, and 2) to investigate whether single-cell transcriptomic profiling can provide novel insights
into the pathobiology of pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is a deadly and progressive condition for which
diagnostic approaches remain imprecise and effective therapies are lacking. Together with his mentors, Drs.
Scott Budinger and Luís Amaral, the candidate has developed a comprehensive training plan that will ensure Dr.
Reyfman acquires new knowledge and proficiencies in developing hypotheses, designing and completing
experiments, analyzing data, and communicating findings to the scientific community. As an essential component
of this training plan, the candidate will employ systems biology approaches to developing tools for analysis of
single-cell transcriptomic datasets generated from patients with pulmonary fibrosis.
Single-cell transcriptomic profiling is increasingly used to investigate the pathobiology of disease in humans and
as a basis for developing novel biomarkers of disease. Developing and validating tools for analyzing the rapidly
growing quantity of single-cell transcriptomic data is as much of a challenge as refining techniques for generating
data from healthy and diseased tissues. In particular, it is not known whether analysis of single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq) data can be used to quantify
accurately the cellular composition of the lung and to identify gene expression differences between health and
pulmonary fibrosis. Our preliminary data suggest that scRNA-Seq of lung identifies profibrotic gene expression
in patients with pulmonary fibrosis that is heterogeneous between individuals. We also found that scRNA-Seq
undersampled certain constituent lung cellular populations. Accordingly, we designed this proposal to test the
hypothesis that single-cell transcriptomic analysis of lung samples from patients with pulmonary fibrosis can be
used to identify disease endotypes. In Specific Aim 1, the candidate will determine whether snRNA-Seq enables
quantification of the cellular composition of the lung during pulmonary fibrosis. In Specific Aim 2, the candidate
will develop tools for using scRNA-Seq performed on specimens obtained from patients with SSc-ILD and normal
controls to gain novel insights into disease pathobiology. Over the course of this award, the candidate will gain
new skills including in generating snRNA-Seq from cryopreserved lung tissue, in lung stereology, in RNA in situ
hybridization, in analysis of complementary genomic datasets, and in incorporation of clinical phenotypic
information into genomic analyses. Accomplishing the proposed work will provide a rigorous training program for
Dr. Reyfman and will provide insights that could lead to improved therapies for patients with pulmonary fibrosis.

"The molecular epidemiology of lung cancer in Africa is almost completely unknown, yet molecular profiling and
institution of targeted therapy is now standardly used to influence care in patients with actionable mutations. HIV-
infection is associated with a markedly increased risk of lung cancer, but its association with lung cancer and
how it influences disease outcomes is not well studied. The capacity to correctly diagnose lung cancer on
radiological images, tissue specimen acquisition, and subsequent histologic confirmation compounds the
problem of under and misdiagnosis of lung cancer in Africa, especially with the prevalence and often presumptive
clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis infection. In this consortium proposal, we therefore seek to address the above
stated problems by 1) establishing national lung cancer diagnostic referral networks in Uganda and Tanzania,
which will allow for improved detection of lung cancer and, hence decrease the lung cancer burden; 2)
investigating the role of HIV-1 infection on the incidence and outcomes of lung cancer in the region; 3)
determining the molecular profile of lung cancer in East African countries in order to facilitate advocacy for scale-
up of targeted therapies (including immune-based therapies); 4) building capacity for lung cancer diagnosis and

5) creating a lung cancer research collaboration that will build capacity through mentoring of junior researchers
for future leadership in the field. At the end of this project, we envision an African-led lung cancer research

"Lung cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States. The National Lung Screening Trial
(NLST) showed that more lung cancers can be detected at an early stage with low dose CT screening.
However, over-diagnosis of indolent lung cancer and benign nodules is one of the major limitations of
screening, resulting in unnecessary treatment, biopsy, follow-up, increased radiation exposure, patient anxiety,
and cost. Due to a lack of in-depth knowledge of the correlation of structural image features and histologic
findings of lung nodules and the absence of validated diagnostic biomarkers for accurate disease
categorization, the current diagnosis and management of the screen-detected nodules remains challenging.
 The goal of this proposed project is to develop a decision support system (DSS) based on quantitative
histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) of pulmonary nodules using advanced computer vision and
machine learning techniques to characterize the histopathologic features of nodules and analyze their
correlations with CT image features for improvement of early detection of lung cancer. We hypothesize that
the proposed q-PCD analysis will have strong association with histopathologic characterization, and therefore
will be a more effective biomarker for differentiation of invasive, pre-invasive, and benign nodules than
conventional image-based features or radiologists' visual judgement. Accurate characterization of the nodule
types will assist radiologists in making decision for management of the detected nodules; e.g., enabling early
detection and treatment of invasive lung cancer, safe surveillance or replacing lobectomy with limited sublobar
resection for pre-invasive lung cancer, and sparing biopsy of benign nodules, thereby reducing morbidity and
costs in lung cancer screening programs. Our major specific aims are to 1) collect a large database of LDCT
screening cases from NLST project and our institute to develop automated image analysis methods, 2) to
develop a new DSS based on quantitative pathologic correlated CT descriptors (q-PCD) of lung nodules, 3)
validate the effectiveness of DSS in lung cancer diagnosis. To achieve these aims, we will collect a large data
set from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and our institute. The collected database will include the
baseline and follow up scans, pathology data, demographic information and other information provided by
NLST. We will develop automated segmentation methods to extract the volumes of the solid and sub-solid
components of detected lung nodules, develop quantitative methods to characterize the radiologic and
pathologic features of lung nodules as well as the surrounding lung parenchyma, develop a novel
radiopathomics strategy to correlate pathomics with radiomics, and to identify new imaging biomarkers. We will
develop a clinically-translatable DSS with a joint biomarker combining both image and patient information, and
evaluate its performance in lung cancer diagnosis, including its effectiveness in baseline screening CT exams
