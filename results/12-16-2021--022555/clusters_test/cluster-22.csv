"Abstract:
 The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate
to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical
experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical
research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and
Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The
short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk
factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and
gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and
cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine
the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and
severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term
scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and
neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the
earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and
neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K
development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced
biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design,
implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation
intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological
mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes
measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the
first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus
paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This
proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the
following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its
progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of
FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in
FXTAS.

"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Early diagnosis and identification of predictors for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is crucial as it allows intervention
with prevention and treatment strategies when neuronal loss is at its minimum. Spatial navigation is a complex
and multi-component skill that gets impaired early in the course of brain diseases and may be considered a
relevant, sensitive and specific marker for future clinical progress of AD, even in its preclinical stage. Active
spatial navigation assessments allow to identify modifications of gait associated with cognitive decline, and to
amplify the difficulty of the test through a dual task effect created by the increased postural demands of walking.
This study will validate the first motor-cognitive screening instrument able to extract digital markers in the form
of navigational and gait performances in people at risk of developing AD. We propose that a fully immersive
Virtual Reality (VR) navigational test has numerous advantages with respect to classical tests because it allows
the manipulation of environmental features based on specific needs. We will use a VR version of the Floor Maze
Test (VR-FMT) to create virtual mazes with preferred complexity and display them within a commercial VR
headset. Cognitively normal adults at low risk and higher risk of developing AD and subjects with amnesic mild
cognitive impairment will complete two visits. In the first visit, a battery of neuropsychological tests will be taken.
In the second, participants will perform multiple navigations inside the VR-FMT. Two visuals representations
(vista and environmental), and two explorations types (real walking and with a joystick) will be tested. Gait will
be recorded using VR trackers and a motion capture system. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) will
be used to measure resting-state brain connectivity. In Aim 1 we will validate the gait measures and the
manipulations operated by the VR-FMT. We hypothesize that the portable trackers will show comparable validity
in measuring gait compared to the optical motion capture system and that participants will show different
navigation performance in the walking and the in-place versions and in the environmental and vista spaces
versions of the VR-FMT. In Aim 2 we will investigate the ability of the VR-FMT as a test to differentiate the various
levels of cognitive impairment. We hypothesize that navigation performance while performing the active version
of the VR-FMT in the environmental space would show superior ability to distinguish the groups. Then, a machine
learning algorithm will be used to extract the most significant features and classify participants. We hypothesize
that both gait and navigation performances would increase the sensitivity of the classifier. In Aim 3 we will explore
associations between performance in the VR-FMT, neuropsychological tests, and brain connectivity. We
hypothesize that lower navigation performance will be associated with altered brain connectivity and lower
psychomotor speed, memory and executive function scores. Findings from this research will set the stage for
further longitudinal studies which will be aimed at predicting accumulating AD biomarkers. The long-term goal is
to develop an accurate, low-cost, user-friendly, and portable system that can be used to predict cognitive decline.

"Osteoarthritis (OA), a multifactorial disease that causes joint degeneration, affects 27 million U.S.
adults, and often leads to severe disability. The prevalence of OA is 33.6% in adults older than 65 years.
Despite the fact that OA is a widespread and debilitating disease, treatment options are currently extremely
limited, and established disease-modifying therapies do not exist. The solution generally offered to treat late
stage, symptomatic knee OA is joint replacement (total knee/hip arthroplasty, TKA/THA), and while this
surgically invasive and expensive remedy offers temporary relief, replacements often fail after 10-15 years,
with shorter life spans in obese individuals. In order to reduce the number of TKA/THA procedures, preventive
efforts and interventions targeting early stage OA are essential – the first step would be identifying subjects at
high risk for disease development, at a stage when tissue is not yet lost, and cartilage matrix abnormalities are
potentially reversible. Understanding the complex pathophysiology of joint degeneration, knee and hip joint
interactions, impact of gait biomechanics, are all critical to determine the mechanistic basis of hip OA.
 Hip OA progression marked by changes in cartilage biochemistry has complex multi-joint interactions
with several mechanistic factors, including morphological features, gait biomechanics and demographics.
However, studies to date have mostly focused on the relationship between single mechanistic factors and
semi-quantitative/ quantitative imaging measures, gait biomechanics, or non-objective symptomatic evidence
of hip OA. The overall goal of this competitive renewal is to extend our longitudinal work to determine the
structure-function-connectivity and mechanistic factors that mediate biochemical degeneration of hip cartilage
associated with OA progression over the mid-term (6-8-year) period.
 In this proposal, subjects will be recruited for a longitudinal study (covering 5-8 year follow up) from our
existing cohort (n=184 hips, 92 subjects), with the availability of existing 3-year follow-up data including bi-
lateral hip radiographs and MR images, gait biomechanics and patient reported outcomes. We will use novel,
fully automated and translational methods to measure MRI-based T1ρ and T2 relaxation time on a voxel basis,
which will provide precise and localized information on cartilage proteoglycan and collagen integrity and water
content. Automatic segmentation techniques combined with machine learning algorithms will be used to
analyze cartilage T1ρ/T2 in a well-characterized dataset with quantifiable T1ρ/T2 values on a voxel-level, and to
automatically detect the patterns of focal T1ρ/T2 elevations that lead to later stage OA and drive progression of
degenerative disease (over 8 years). Detailed analysis of gait biomechanics using functional principal
component analysis will utilize the rich skeletal biomechanics data and imaging (over 8 years). Imaging the
knee and hip longitudinally will provide a multi-joint analysis of OA progression (over 4 years) not done
previously and will provide unique insights in the mechanisms in hip OA, connections with knee changes. 3-Dimensional;Adult;Affect;Age;American;Biochemical;Biochemistry;Biomechanics;Cartilage;Cartilage Matrix;Collagen;Complex;Contralateral;Data;Data Analyses;Data Set;Degenerative Disorder;Degenerative polyarthritis;Development;Disease;Disease Progression;Early Diagnosis;Elderly;Etiology;Exhibits;Financial Hardship;Functional disorder;Gait;Goals;Head;Health;Hip Joint;Hip Osteoarthritis;Hip region structure;Image;Individual;Injury;Intervention;Ipsilateral;Joints;Kinetics;Knee;Knee Osteoarthritis;Knee joint;Lateral;Lead;Lesion;Limb structure;Link;Longevity;Longitudinal Studies;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Maps;Measures;Mediating;Mediation;Mediator of activation protein;Methods;Modeling;Morphology;Motivation;Multivariate Analysis;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome Measure;Pain;Patient Outcomes Assessments;Patients;Pattern;Phenotype;Prevalence;Preventive;Preventive treatment;Principal Component Analysis;Procedures;Progress Reports;Proteoglycan;Relaxation;Replacement Arthroplasty;Reporting;Role;Rotation;Severities;Shapes;Structure;Subgroup;Techniques;Time;Tissues;Water;Work;automated segmentation;base;bone;cartilage degradation;cohort;demographics;disability;disorder risk;follow-up;functional outcomes;gait examination;high risk;hip replacement arthroplasty;innovation;insight;joint destruction;kinematics;knee replacement arthroplasty;machine learning algorithm;multidimensional data;novel;obese person;quantitative imaging;rate of change;recruit;skeletal Structural, Biochemical and Functional Connectivity in Osteoarthritis using Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Skeletal Biomechanics","Osteoarthritis (OA), a multifactorial disease that causes joint degeneration, affects 27 million U.S.

"The United States population is growing older. There is an urgent need for tools to better connect health professionals with their patients and perform at-home assessments in an automated fashion. The long-term goal of this proposal is to discover the knowledge necessary to enable an always-on, non-intrusive, non-wearable smart system for automated at-home gait parameter estimation using floor vibrations. To achieve this vision, the proposal has the objective of connecting health professionals with older adults living independently through a smart system that estimates gait parameters using floor vibration. The aims to achieve this goal are to 1) determine at-home gait parameters as a function of time and space; 2) establish a digital identifier of the older adult based on gait parameters; and 3) correlate changes in at-home gait parameters, after considering spatial-temporal correlations, with changes in the well-being of the resident. The proposed research will advance the state-of-the-art in engineering, physical therapy and public health by testing the following hypotheses: 1) Floor vibration is a viable means to automatically and continuously determine gait parameters; 2) For healthy individuals living in an independent at-home setting, gait parameters will be consistent based on location in the home, time of the day and day of the week; and 3) For patients recently discharged from the hospital, recovery will correlate with improvements in their gait parameters. The testing of the hypotheses will be performed through five tasks: 1) Develop an automated system to capture floor vibration and extract gait parameters; 2) Validate the system in laboratory setting; 3) Collect data at participant’s homes; 4) Test the hypothesis that at-home gait parameters are consistent with time and space; 5) Test the hypothesis that improvement in gait parameters correlates improvement in health status of recently discharged patients. This research will be pursued by a group of interdisciplinary researchers in engineering and physical therapy with the support of an experienced geriatric physician and will advance the knowledge in signal processing techniques, estimation and validation of at-home gait parameters and their uncertainty, and relationship between changes at-home gait parameters and changes in health status. The proposed activities will have a significant impact on older adult care, the research community and the next generation of researchers and engineers stemming from: 1) improved health of older adults and reduced health care cost by early intervening and thus decreasing the readmission rate; 2) increased scientific literacy and public engagement through benchmark problems, interdisciplinary seminars, new courses and outreach activities; 3) the training of diverse convergence researchers competent in solving interdisciplinary problems, including underrepresented groups in STEM fields.

"Early detection of pre-clinical Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) during the long latent period prior to
manifest dementia offers significant opportunities to advance the development of disease
modifying interventions and effectively slow the disease’s progression. To achieve this objective,
there is a critical need for new technologies that accelerate the development of biomarkers with
high sensitivity for underlying AD pathology. A highly promising biomarker for preclinical AD
is gait, as subtle gait changes have been correlated with elevated amyloid burden and
cortical atrophy. While even simple measures of gait speed predict incident dementia in older
adults, current research indicates that preclinical AD pathology is more precisely captured
by a combination of 3D kinematic and spatio-temporal measures. A cost-effective mobile
application that can be used in clinical trials and by healthcare personnel to capture these
parameters efficiently, combined with a validated system to translate the measures to quantifiable
AD risk in minutes, would result in a paradigm shift in availability of AD screening for at-risk
individuals.

product that employs computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) to compute clinically accurate
spatio-temporal and 3D kinematic data, from a simple video of a person walking. GaitIQTM

The expected outcome is that advanced kinematic/spatio-temporal measures of gait
captured by the GaitIQTM system will reveal a sensitive and specific gait signature with high
