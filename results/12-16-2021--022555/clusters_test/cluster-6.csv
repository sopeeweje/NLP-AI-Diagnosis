"Project Summary
Wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to huge clinical databases, which enable the rapid
growth of healthcare analytics market. One particular challenge for analyzing EHRs data is that much detailed
patient information is embedded in clinical documents and not directly available for downstream analysis.
Therefore, clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information embedded in
clinical narratives, have received great attention, with an estimated global market of $2.65 billion by 2021 . In our
previous work, we have developed CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing), a clinical
NLP tool with demonstrated superior performance through multiple international NLP challenges and a large
user community (over 1,500 downloads by users from over 700 organizations). Commercialization of CLAMP by
Melax Technologies Inc. has been successful (i.e., with a dozen licensed customers now); but it also reveals its
limitations as a desktop application in the Cloud era. Therefore, we propose to extend CLAMP to a new Cloud-
based, Service-oriented platform (called CLAMP-CS), which will address the identified challenges by: 1)
improving clinical NLP performance and reducing annotation cost by leveraging the state-of-the-art algorithms
such as deep learning, active learning and transfer learning and making them accessible to less experienced
users; 2) following new service-oriented architectures to make CLAMP-CS available via SaaS and PaaS, ready
for Cloud-based development and deployment; and 3) improving CLAMP-CS interoperability with downstream
applications following two widely used standard representations: HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability
Resources) and OMOP CMD (Common Data Model), to support the use cases in clinical operations and research
respectively. With these advanced features, we believe CLAMP-CS will be a leading clinical NLP system in the
market and it will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and
clinical/translational research.

"Project Summary
The proposed project details an innovative line of research that draws on advanced tools from the field of network
science to elucidate typical and atypical language learning mechanisms in adults. Network analysis of natural
language has revealed a number of global structural patterns emerging from relationships (used to construct
network edges) between words (used as network nodes). Informed by the naturally-occurring network
architecture of real-world languages, we will construct miniature artificial languages that display emergent
properties of existing language systems and measure the extent to which these languages are learned by adults
with typical development (TD) and those with developmental language disorder (DLD) (Aim 1). Given that DLD
is often associated with deficits in processing and producing complex morphosyntax, we will concentrate on
networks in which edges between words represent either their co-occurrence in a sentence or overlap in
morphological family (e.g., eater, eating). In Aim 2, we will examine whether language learning deficits in adults
with DLD might be recast as a hyperfocus on local-level information (i.e., “oddball” structures or individual word
frequency) at the expense of the broader architecture of the language learning environment. To strengthen links
between deficits in language learning and expressive language, Aim 3 calls for the network analysis of elicited
speech samples to reveal whether individuals less sensitive to complexity in learning might also display reduced
complexity in their language output. Of individuals diagnosed with receptive and expressive language disorder
in childhood, the vast majority continue to struggle with language impairment in adulthood. Despite a pressing
need for expansion of adult-oriented language interventions, characterization of the full scope of deficits in
individuals with DLD, in addition to their language learning mechanisms beyond childhood, is an understudied
area. 2 year old;Address;Adult;Architecture;Area;Blueberries;Child;Child Language;Childhood;Complex;Dependence;Development;Diagnosis;Eating;Employment;Environment;Exhibits;Exposure to;Family;Frequencies;Human;Impairment;Individual;Instinct;Intervention;Knowledge;Language;Language Development;Language Development Disorders;Language Disorders;Lead;Learning;Linguistics;Link;Measures;Methods;Morphology;Natural Language Processing;Output;Participant;Pathway Analysis;Pattern;Population;Prevalence;Process;Production;Property;Raspberries;Records;Research;Role;Sampling;Science;Semantics;Series;Signal Transduction;Speech;Strawberries;Structure;System;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Toddler;Work;aged;classical conditioning;design;early childhood;educational atmosphere;experimental study;flexibility;indexing;innovation;kindergarten;language impairment;natural language;network architecture;phrases;statistics;syntax;therapeutic development;tool;young adult The Influence of Morphosyntactic Network Complexity on Typical and Atypical Language Learning","Project Summary

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with motor difficulties in speech
production and fine-motor tasks. Assessments of motor impairments, however, can be subjective and miss subtle
and specific abnormalities. Therefore, there is a need to develop objective measures for clinicians to assess and
understand speech- and fine-motor impairments in individuals with ASD. In addition, recent research suggests
that difficulties with speech production, fine-motor, and oculo-motor tasks may contribute to language difficulties
in ASD. The purpose of this project is to develop objective measures of speech- and fine-motor coordination in
children with ASD, and to characterize the relationship between motor modalities and expressive language in
ASD using these measures. We will focus on three speech subsystems: articulatory, laryngeal, and respiratory,
as well as handwriting and eye movement. In a pilot study we conducted at the Lurie Center for Autism, we
utilized novel coordination features developed in our lab to highlight lower complexity of coordination, or higher
coupling, between and within speech subsystems in highly verbal children with ASD as compared to neurotypical
controls. The analyses also indicated lower complexity of coordination during handwriting in children with ASD,
suggesting there may be similar underlying mechanisms across these motor systems. In the proposed project,
we will extend upon these promising results, evaluating measures of motor coordination using low-level features
derived from speech, handwriting, and eye movement tasks completed by children with ASD and neurotypical
controls. We will employ acoustic-to-articulatory inversion techniques to extract more physiologically accurate
vocal tract articulator movements and coordination. Aim 1 uses measures of coordination to characterize the
complexity of speech- and fine-motor coordination in children with ASD. We will also determine the features
which provide the highest discriminatory ability between children with ASD and neurotypical controls using
machine learning models. We expect that identification of patterns of complexity and important discriminatory
features will provide a better understanding of the dependencies across and within motor subsystems, which
could be used for objective assessment and tracking of motor difficulties in ASD. Aim 2 characterizes the
relationship between speech- and fine-motor skills and expressive language ability. We will evaluate correlations
and regressions between measures of motor coordination and scores on assessments of expressive language.
We believe that motor tasks and features which show high correlations with evaluations of language ability will
provide further insight into how motor modalities are associated with language difficulties in ASD. In summary,
this proposal aims to quantify and understand speech- and fine-motor coordination challenges in ASD using
objective measures of motor coordination, and aims to characterize the relationship between speech- and fine-
motor subsystems and expressive language in ASD. This project works towards our long-term goal of developing
a platform to assess, understand, and track motor and communication challenges in children with ASD.

"Project Summary Abstract
The American Academy of Pediatrics has mandated identification of autism (ASD) beginning at the
routine 18-month visit, based on evidence that early intervention for children with autism improves
outcomes. However, the US Preventive Task Force has not endorsed that recommendation, in part
because of limited validity data. This study builds on a series of studies by our group aimed at
improving early autism identification. We have developed a promising novel and efficient screener for
primary care called Toddler Autism and Development Adaptive Screen (TADAS). The TADAS was
developed using machine learning to automatically determine which items to collect from the parent in
each case based on data from a community sample in a previous project. Currently used autism
screeners have high rates of missing children who have signs of ASD or Developmental Delay (DD) and
also problematic and costly rates of over-referral. Data from our prior studies showed that TADAS had
nearly three times the sensitivity (.94 vs .32) and similar specificity (.87 vs .90) to the currently
recommended and most popular screen for autism (M-CHAT-R/F) and more than twice the sensitivity
(.94 vs .39) and similar specificity (.79 vs .85) for developmental delay of the current standard Age &
Stages Questionnaire-3tm. The TADAS also provides greater efficiencies since a difficult-to-implement
recommended follow-up interview is not required and there is less parent burden in overall number of
items. This proposal is to program TADAS for online delivery then validate it against diagnostic testing
for ASD and DD in a new community sample of children coming for their 18-month well child visit that
better reflects the U.S. population in racial, ethnic and socioeconomic status than our original study
population. If our initial results are further validated in this study, screening for early ASD and DD
could be much more effective with corresponding improvements in child outcomes through earlier
intervention. A side benefit of the project will be an efficient Computer Adaptive Testing language
screen based on existing national language abilities data that could be used independently to both track
language impaired toddlers who are at risk for later development of autism as well as for general
language screening in primary care. These innovative new tools are being created within an online
clinical support system, called CHADIS that has additional features to assist in the entire process of
early identification, referral, and tracking. CHADIS provides individualized patient education for the
parent; clinician use of care coordination software connecting primary care with early intervention
services with options to share data and track outcomes; as well as options for doctors to receive
required Board re-certification credits for participating in autism screening quality improvement
efforts. The final product and “system of care” of value to clinicians, insurers, municipalities and states.

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background: Depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period affects up to 15% of US mothers, imposing costs on
mother, child, and society. Early detection can significantly reduce the incidence of depression, yet depressive symptoms
are often missed during prenatal visits, which tend to focus on maternal and fetal physical health, leaving less time for
maternal mental health. Even if mental health is addressed during prenatal care, women may not feel comfortable answering
questions that are perceived to be embarrassing or invasive. Failing to detect depression is even more likely during the
postpartum period due to infrequent physician visits once the baby has been born. Measurement in the form of daily journals,
which can be analyzed using natural language processing, can promote early and more frequent detection of depression
during pregnancy and the postpartum period.
Study Aims: 1) Model which dynamic features of language used over time best predict changes in depression status in the
pregnancy and postpartum periods, creating phenotypes of depression risk; 2) examine how the language patterns that
predict depression differ for African-American and Caucasian women; and 3) identify the relationship between the
characteristics of what depressed peripartum women say and their treatment-seeking behavior.
Innovation: The proposed research is innovative in its use of high frequency natural language measurements, captured in
daily journals using a smartphone app, combined with advances in natural language processing models, to assess the onset
and trajectory of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This is the first prospective longitudinal study
using natural language collection for risk prediction in a clinical population and the first to: 1) characterize the critical topics
women discuss during the peripartum period over time using open-ended journals; 2) evaluate multiple facets of language
to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between language and depression; 3) use a longitudinal
design approach allowing for optimal modeling of language changes associated with depression onset.
Methodology and Expected Results: Monthly depression risk identified from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale.
will be collected through the MyHealthyPregnancy smartphone app, a mobile health application developed through close
collaboration between decision scientists, clinicians, statisticians, and local peripartum women. A daily journal embedded
in the MyHealthyPregnancy app will collect natural language text from the participants for 10 months (from their first
prenatal visit through two months postpartum). Using three distinct natural language processing algorithmic approaches,
this study will characterize how the natural language used by peripartum women in their daily journal entries is connected
to the onset and experience of peripartum depression, as measured through monthly-administered depression scales. Group-
based trajectory modeling will then classify women according to the patterns in their depression scores over time.
Potential Impact: This work lays the foundation for developing and evaluating real-time interventions that could be
deployed at scale to women who are using language that signals high depression risk.

"Abstract
 Children with poor early language skills are at risk for academic, social, vocational, and health challenges
across the lifespan (Botting & Conti-Ramsden, 2008; Conti-Ramsden, Durkin, Toseeb, Botting, & Pickles,
2017; Norbury & Sonuga-Barke, 2017; Pace, Alper, Burchinal, Golinkoff, & Hirsh-Pasek, 2019). This at-risk
group includes approximately 1.6 million children under five with primary developmental language disorder
(DLD) and 300,500 children with DLD and an autism spectrum disorder (ASD+DLD; Bishop, 2010; Norbury &
Sonuga-Barke, 2017; U.S. Census Bureau, 2017b; Xu, Strathearn, Liu, & Bao, 2018). Parent-implemented
early language intervention is a cost-effective option to address this public health issue. However, these
interventions yield large individual differences in outcomes and limited scalability (Roberts & Kaiser, 2011).
Variable intervention effectiveness could result from many factors including parent-level differences in
language skills and behavioral awareness. Despite differences in interaction quality across parents (Hirsh-
Pasek et al., 2015), and potential heritable components of language disorder (Bishop, 2009), there has been
little to no exploration of the role of these parent-level factors in early language interaction and intervention.
 This project will address this critical gap in the evidence. Parents' language skills will be examined in
relationship to the quality of parent–child language interactions (Aim1). Furthermore, this research will explore
whether parents' behavioral awareness predicts their modifiability after brief training (Aim 2). Finally, predictors
of early language interaction quality and modifiability will be compared in dyads with typically developing
children, children with primary DLD, and with ASD+DLD (Aim 3). The long-term goal of this research program
is to increase intervention effectiveness and improve child outcomes by extending the social-interactionist
framework to scaffold parents. Differences between the DLD and ASD+DLD groups could inform disorder-
specific intervention recommendations. Behavioral data will be collected from three groups of parent-child
dyads—children with primary DLD (Aim 1,2,&3), children with ASD+DLD (Aim 3), and age-matched controls
(Aim 1,2,&3). Inter- and intra-group analyses will be conducted to explore the relationships between parent-
level factors, the quality of parent–child interaction, and parent modifiability following parent training.
 These aims will support the long-term career development goal of improving the language, academic, and
health outcomes of at-risk children through family-centered early language intervention research. Three
specific areas of career development have also been identified: 1) examining individual-level factors that
impact early language interaction and intervention outcomes, 2) applying family-centered intervention to
specific disorder groups, and 3) analyzing multi-level and longitudinal data. The career development will take
place at an R1 university with support from an accomplished, inter-disciplinary mentorship team.

Sonuga-Barke, 2017; U.S. Census Bureau, 2017b; Xu, Strathearn, Liu, & Bao, 2018). Parent-implemented
early language intervention is a cost-effective option to address this public health issue. However, these
interventions yield large individual differences in outcomes and limited scalability (Roberts & Kaiser, 2011).
Variable intervention effectiveness could result from many factors including parent-level differences in
language skills and behavioral awareness. Despite differences in interaction quality across parents (Hirsh-
Pasek et al., 2015), and potential heritable components of language disorder (Bishop, 2009), there has been
little to no exploration of the role of these parent-level factors in early language interaction and intervention.
 This project will address this critical gap in the evidence. Parents' language skills will be examined in
relationship to the quality of parent–child language interactions (Aim1). Furthermore, this research will explore
whether parents' behavioral awareness predicts their modifiability after brief training (Aim 2). Finally, predictors
of early language interaction quality and modifiability will be compared in dyads with typically developing
children, children with primary DLD, and with ASD+DLD (Aim 3). The long-term goal of this research program
is to increase intervention effectiveness and improve child outcomes by extending the social-interactionist
framework to scaffold parents. Differences between the DLD and ASD+DLD groups could inform disorder-
specific intervention recommendations. Behavioral data will be collected from three groups of parent-child
dyads—children with primary DLD (Aim 1,2,&3), children with ASD+DLD (Aim 3), and age-matched controls
(Aim 1,2,&3). Inter- and intra-group analyses will be conducted to explore the relationships between parent-
level factors, the quality of parent–child interaction, and parent modifiability following parent training.
 These aims will support the long-term career development goal of improving the language, academic, and
health outcomes of at-risk children through family-centered early language intervention research. Three
specific areas of career development have also been identified: 1) examining individual-level factors that
impact early language interaction and intervention outcomes, 2) applying family-centered intervention to
specific disorder groups, and 3) analyzing multi-level and longitudinal data. The career development will take
place at an R1 university with support from an accomplished, inter-disciplinary mentorship team.",10061590,K23DC017763,['K23DC017763'],DC,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10061590,K23,2021,162602
"A critical characteristic of human language is our ability to understand multi-word sequences whose
meaning is greater than the sum of their parts. Recent work from the PIs of this proposal (Toneva and Wehbe,
2019; Jain and Huth, 2018) and others (Schrimpf et al., 2020a; Caucheteux & King, 2020) has shown that
cortical representations of multi-word sequences can be modeled much more accurately than before by
using neural network language models, a machine learning technique that has revolutionized the natural
language processing (NLP) field (Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019). However, under the current
paradigm these models must first be trained on separate NLP tasks and only then used to model the brain,
creating a guess-and-check cycle that is not guaranteed to converge on the actual computations that
humans perform. Here we propose to break this cycle by directly training neural network models to
estimate the functions that the brain uses to combine words. To be able to optimally predict fMRI and MEG
responses, these models will need to capture the composition principles governing which words the brain
attends to, and how information is combined across words. These models will help uncover specific
computations underlying language processing in the brain, enable computational testing of neurolinguistic
theories, and inspire or directly improve models used in NLP.
 Accomplishing these goals, however, will require overcoming one major obstacle. Training neural net-
work language models typically requires orders of magnitude more data than existing neuroimaging
datasets. To address this issue, one central goal of this proposed project is to collect a very large fMRI and
MEG dataset comprising roughly one million words of natural language stimuli. We plan to use the unique
dataset and computational modeling framework to address three scientific aims.
Aim 1: Create brain activity prediction benchmarks to foster interaction between neuroscience and NLP.
Aim 2: Use data-driven models to test existing neurolinguistic theories & develop new accounts of the
computations underlying word composition in the brain. Aim 3: Leverage information in different brain
areas to help solve computationally defined language tasks.
 Successful completion of the proposed work will provide mechanistic insight into language processing,
with a computational architecture tracing information flow among brain areas and describing the tasks they
perform. Beyond its basic cognitive neuroscience implications, we expect this work will enable better
understanding of language impairments and help identify targeted therapies.

"Project Summary
This Administrative Supplement proposes implementation of a multimodal data pipeline to support
machine learning of child language production in complex naturalistic environments. The Supplement
builds on the parent R01 (DC018542) that gathers objective, longitudinal data to capture the vocal
interactions of children with hearing loss (HL). Even with cochlear implantation, HL is a life-altering
condition with high social costs. Inclusion of children with HL and typically hearing (TH) peers in
preschool classrooms is a national standard, but it is not clear how early vocal interaction contributes to
the language development of children with HL and their TH peers. The parent R01 employs
computational models of child location and orientation to indicate when children are in social contact
with their peers and teachers. An additional strategy for pursuing the broad goals of the R01—
identifying interactive contexts in which children produce phonemically complex vocalizations and
interactive speech—is machine learning. Machine learning algorithms can determine the contextual,
individual, and interactive factors that predict children’s vocalizations and vocal interactions. However,
the parent R01 does not propose machine learning, nor are data disseminated in a format designed to
facilitate machine learning. To facilitate machine learning in the classroom, a rigorous diarization
process is required to determine speaker identity, which is operationalized as the likelihood that each
vocalization was spoken by a given child or teacher. We will integrate audio processing of each target
child and teacher’s first-person audio recording with processing of their interactive partners’ recordings.
The influence of partner recordings will be determined by their physical distance and orientation relative
to the target. This will yield a weighted speaker identification score for each vocalization. For 25% of the
sample, the algorithmic score will be compared to speaker identification provided by trained coders to
quantify intersystem reliability. Processed datasets will include 7,160 hours of multimodal recordings of
child and teacher movement in classrooms synchronized with continuously recorded, child- and
teacher-specific (first-person) audio recordings. De-identified output data will characterize vocalizations
with respect to algorithmically computed speaker identification probabilities, coder-identified speaker
identity (25% of sample), phonemic complexity and audio characteristics (e.g., fundamental frequency),
as well as the position and relative orientation of all individuals in the classroom, and child
demographics (including characterizations of HL). Over the course of the supplement, output data,
Python processing code, and metadata descriptions of the processing pipeline will be disseminated in
dedicated distribution portals including Github, Kaggle, and the UCI repository. Recordings will be
released to certified investigators via NIH-funded repositories such as Databrary and Homebank.

"Abstract
Language delay and impairments are common in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), as are sensory (including
auditory) anomalies. Since acquisition of spoken language relies on the integrity of the auditory system,
language delay and impairments may be related to sound processing abnormalities that are frequently
observed in children with ASDs (despite normal peripheral hearing). However, it is not understood if and how
early auditory brain anomalies may developmentally contribute to impaired language development.
 This project will examine the maturation of auditory and language systems in the brain across early
childhood, during the critical period for language acquisition. We will employ a longitudinal design and
multimodal neuroimaging, including high-resolution anatomical, diffusion, and functional magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), with added frequent and extensive behavioral and neuropsychological assessments. Our
central hypothesis is that early disruptions to cortical sound processing precede and predict language
impairments in ASDs and may thus be considered causal contributors – a hypothesis that has been frequently
considered in the literature, but never tested at the neural level.
 Our aims are to thoroughly characterize the structural integrity and functional differentiation of the
cortical auditory and language systems (Aim 1) and their maturational trajectories (Aim 2) in toddlers with
ASDs and age-matched typically developing peers. This will allow us to establish whether neural abnormalities
in cortical processing of complex sounds in toddlers are predictive of language development and social
behavior at the pre-school age (Aim 3). The rationale and translational significance of this project are that
identification of alterations in brain development linked to language delay and impairment in the first years of
life will allow for more targeted interventions in the auditory domain at a time when they are most effective.

"Improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and
treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, progress in testing these treatments is
limited by the lack of informative outcome measures to indicate whether or not an intervention or treatment is
having the desired effect on a child's conversational use of language (i.e., discourse skills). The long-term
goal of the proposed renewal project is to harness the benefits of NLP to impact functional spoken language
outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The goal of the parent R01 (R01DC012033) is to
develop and validate new Natural Language Processing (NLP) based methods that automatically measure
discourse-related skills, including language productivity (talkativeness), grammar and vocabulary, and
discourse, based on raw (i.e., not coded or annotated) transcripts of natural language samples. Our objective
in this proposal is to take the next step to evaluate the suitability of these NLP-based measures as outcomes for
children with a range of intellectual abilities, language levels, and diagnoses. NLP algorithms require choices of
pivotal parameter settings, such as word frequency dependent weights. While our previous results, involving
between-group contrasts, were insensitive to these settings, our proposed project, involving psychometric
quantities such as validity, may be sensitive to them. Building on our progress from the parent R01, we propose
to pursue three specific aims: (1) Identify pivotal parameter settings that optimize stability of NLP discourse
measures, and examine responsiveness to real change; (2) Evaluate consistency of NLP discourse measures,
and identify key measurement factors that impact consistency; and (3) Evaluate validity of NLP discourse
measures, and differences in validity as a function of diagnostic group, age, IQ, and language ability. Our
approach will focus on optimizing stability of such measures, and assessing responsiveness to change over
time, consistency across sampling contexts and different sample lengths, and validity of each measure. The
contribution of the proposed project will be to systematically assess the psychometric properties of NLP
discourse measures. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantial departure from
the status quo by taking the crucial next step: the development of scalable, psychometrically sound measures of
discourse skills that can be used to assess between-group differences as well as within-individual change over
time. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to result in viable spoken language outcome
measures for children with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, making it possible to target and

completion of this study will provide the immediate ability to scale up treatment evaluations involving
measurement of spoken language use, allowing flexible data collection across sites and studies, and in the

"PROJECT SUMMARY
Asthma, the most common chronic disease among children, is one of the five most burdensome diseases in the
US. While current care and research efforts focus on symptom control and exacerbation risk, children with asthma
may suffer from infectious and inflammatory diseases, ie, asthma-associated infectious and inflammatory disease
comorbidities (AIICs) (eg, pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster, appendicitis, and celiac disease). Although AIICs
pose serious threats to children with asthma, they are largely under-recognized, as evidenced by diabetes mellitus
being widely recognized but a less common chronic illness with a magnitude similar to that for asthma. Presently,
the mechanisms underlying AIICs are unknown. We postulate immunosenescence might be related, as AIICs
coincide with cardinal immunosenescence features. AIICs are not clinically defined and a suitable tool has not been
developed to identify children with AIICs. Thus, no strategies mitigating AIICs risks and outcomes exist.
Addressing these knowledge gaps depends upon two key questions: (1) “How can asthmatic children subgroups
with increased AIICs risk be identified at a population level using electronic medical records?” and (2) “What
immune parameters characterize such children?” Answering these is this proposal's primary goal. To this end, our
current R01 study successfully developed, validated, and implemented natural language processing (NLP)-
empowered computational phenotyping algorithms for two existing criteria for childhood asthma (Predetermined
Asthma Criteria, PAC and Asthma Predictive Index, API). NLP-empowered algorithm application to the 1997-2007
Olmsted County Birth Cohort (OCBC) enabled us to profile a subgroup of children with asthma at increased AIICs
risk, disproportionately represented by children who met both NLP-PAC and NLP-API.
Our new pilot data suggest
asthma potentially accelerates immunosenescence leading to AIICs in a subgroup of asthmatic children.
In this renewal proposal, we target this subgroup who meet both NLP-PAC and NLP-API. We will develop and
apply NLP-empowered computational phenotyping algorithms for AIICs to identify such children at a population
level, then characterize their immune parameters measuring immunosenescence. In Aim 1, we will develop new
NLP-empowered computational phenotyping algorithms for recognized and unrecognized AIICs (NLP-AIIC) for
children enrolled in Mayo Clinic `s 1997-2016 OCBC,
then assess portability of NLP-AIIC at Sanford Children's
Hospital, Sioux Falls, SD
. In Aim 2, we will identify and characterize children with AIICs through new NLP-AIIC and
NLP algorithms for asthma status, by utilizing clinical and immune parameters to measure immunosenescence. In
Aim 3, we will assess changes (eg, waning adaptive immunity) over time in immune parameters measuring
immunosenescence for 300 children in our R01 study, re-enrolling them for further characterization.
This proposed study is indispensable to understanding why some children with asthma develop AIICs, while others
do not. This knowledge will allow us to identify, manage, mitigate, and improve outcomes for AIICs among children.

immunosenescence for 300 children in our R01 study, re-enrolling them for further characterization.
This proposed study is indispensable to understanding why some children with asthma develop AIICs, while others
do not. This knowledge will allow us to identify, manage, mitigate, and improve outcomes for AIICs among children.",10106650,R01HL126667,['R01HL126667'],HL,https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10106650,R01,2021,793451
"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention
is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across
toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification
of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded,
neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI
risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a
developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth
patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP
neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering
emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a
developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common
correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the
team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag,
PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and
diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The
key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing,
and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at
preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal
features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.
 SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and
their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will
each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction.
Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that
provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor
parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural
synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language
environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these
reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual
influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use
machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3.
