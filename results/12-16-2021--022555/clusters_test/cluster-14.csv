"PROJECT SUMMARY
NIEHS has established Predictive Toxicology as a strategic goal for advancing environmental health sciences.
The overarching goal of this RIVER proposal is to predict animal toxicity of chemicals based on their structure.
My team and I will expose millions of zebrafish embryos to a library of 10,000 synthetic chemicals across wide
concentration ranges. If a chemical shows signs of bioactivity, we will systematically analyze whole animal gene
expression changes before the phenotype appears. We will formulate hypotheses about which biomolecular
targets the chemicals attacked initially and which pathways led to the observed endpoint. To test those
hypotheses, we will edit the zebrafish genome via CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out or over-express critical genes, to
discover the ones causally related to the chemical phenotypes.
These studies will be highly relevant to human health. Zebrafish possess fully integrated vertebrate organ
systems that perform the same functions as their human counterparts and demonstrate well-conserved
physiology. Eighty-four percent of the genes that participate in human disease also exist in zebrafish. Zebrafish
studies provide a fast, inexpensive way to screen a large volume of chemicals, generate rich hypotheses for drug
development, and prioritize candidates for toxicity studies with mammals and human cell cultures. We will
compare our results with those of human cell culture studies to clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each
method and to reduce the uncertainty associated with applying zebrafish results to human biology.
We will post our experimental results in a public database that explains which of the 10,000 Tox21 chemicals
are bioactive, which initial targets they strike, and which pathways lead to which endpoints in embryonic and
juvenile zebrafish. This information will enable green chemists to detoxify products by substituting a
biologically inactive molecule. It will help toxicologists and risk assessors to prioritize chemicals for expensive
experiments with rodents and human cell cultures. It will give pharmaceutical scientists thousands of new data
points upon which to develop hypotheses about how to modulate a given gene target or activate a given
pathway.
We will use machine-learning-based chemoinformatic approaches to analyze our zebrafish data and infer the
relationship between the structure of a chemical and its biological activity. Our rich data about chemical
activity networks will advance the scientific community’s understanding of linkages between chemical exposure
and phenotypes. Our work will enable scientists to predict whether a chemical will be biologically active, what
target it will act upon, and what networks it will perturb, solely on the basis of its structure. It will enable
scientists to reduce, refine, and replace experiments with animals, including zebrafish, and to predict chemical
activity networks with computers.

"ABSTRACT
Identification of high-quality chemical probes, molecules with high specificity and selectivity against
macromolecules, is of critical interest to drug discovery. Although millions of compounds have been screened
against thousands of protein targets, small-molecule probes are currently available for only 4% of the human
proteome. Thus, more efficient approaches are required to accelerate the development of novel, target-specific
probes. In 2019, a new bold initiative called “Target 2035” was launched with the goal of “creating […] chemical
probes, and/or functional antibodies for the entire proteome” by 2035. In support of this ambitious initiative, we
propose to develop and test a novel integrative AI-driven methodology for rapid chemical probe discovery against
any target protein. Here, we will build an integrative workflow where the unique XChem database of experimental
crystallographic information describing the pose and nature of chemical fragments binding to the target protein
will be used in several innovative computational approaches to predict the structure of organic molecules with
high affinity towards specific targets. The candidate molecules will be experimentally validated and then
optimized, using computational algorithms, into lead molecules to seed chemical probe development. The
proposed project is structured around three following interrelated keystones: (i) Develop a novel method for
ligand-binding hot-spot identification and discovery of novel chemical probe candidates; (ii) Develop novel
fragment-based integrative computational approach for accelerated de novo design of chemical probes; (iii)
Consensus prediction of target-specific ligands, synthesis, and experimental validation of computational hits.
 More specifically, we will develop a hybrid method to predict structures of high-affinity ligands for proteins for
which XChem fragment screens have been completed. These approaches will be used for screening of ultra-
large (>10 billion) chemical libraries to identify putative high affinity ligands within crystallographically determined
pockets. Then, we will develop and employ an approach using graph convolutional neural networks for de novo
design of a library of strong binders that will be evaluated to select the best candidates for chemical optimization.
Finally, we will combine traditional structure-based and novel approaches, developed in this project to select
consensus hit compounds against three target proteins: transcription factor brachyury, hydrolase NUDT5, and
bromodomain BAZ2B. Iterative design guided by the computational algorithms, synthesis, and testing will
progressively optimize molecules to micromolar leads to chemical probes for the target proteins.
 Completion of the proposed aims will deliver a robust integrative workflow to identify leads for chemical
probes against diverse target proteins. We expect that our AI-based computational approach to convert
crystallographically-determined chemical fragments into lead compounds coupled with the experimental
validation of computational algorithms will accelerate the discovery of new chemical probes, expand the
druggable proteome, and support future drug discovery studies Affinity;Algorithms;Antibodies;Artificial Intelligence;Binding;Binding Sites;Biological Assay;Biophysics;Brachyury protein;Bromodomain;Chemicals;Computational algorithm;Computer software;Computing Methodologies;Consensus;Coupled;Databases;Development;Docking;Future;Goals;Graph;Hot Spot;Human;Hybrids;Hydrolase;Laboratories;Lead;Learning;Libraries;Ligand Binding;Ligands;Methodology;Methods;Mining;Modeling;Modernization;Nature;Phosphotransferases;Procedures;Proteins;Proteome;Psychological reinforcement;Resources;Roentgen Rays;Screening procedure;Seeds;Specificity;Structure;Synthesis Chemistry;Testing;Validation;X-Ray Crystallography;base;chemical synthesis;computational chemistry;convolutional neural network;cost;design;drug candidate;drug discovery;innovation;interest;iterative design;macromolecule;novel;novel strategies;protein structure prediction;scaffold;screening;small molecule;small molecule libraries;structural genomics;success;transcription factor Enabling the Accelerated Discovery of Novel Chemical Probes by Integration of Crystallographic, Computational, and Synthetic Chemistry Approaches","ABSTRACT
