"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mechanical ventilation (MV), which is used to assist or replace spontaneous breathing in critically ill patients, led
to $27 billion in expenditures in the US in 2010, accounting for 12% of all hospital costs. In that same year there
were 2.7 episodes of MV per 1000 population, highlighting the enormous importance of this procedure. The
COVID-19 pandemic has substantially increased these numbers, although precise rates are not yet available.
MV is used, in part, to “unload”, or reduce the metabolic effort of respiratory muscles in order to redirect oxygen
delivery to vital organs. As the patients’ conditions improve, key inspiratory muscles (e.g. diaphragm, scalenes,
sternomastoid, etc.) need to take over spontaneous breathing independent of the ventilator. This “reloading” is
precarious due to muscle disuse atrophy, induced by unloading. This is further complicated by other common
conditions such as septic or cardiogenic shock, which can severely limit oxygen delivery independent of muscle
status. What’s needed is a methodology that can continuously monitor blood flow and oxygen utilization of
inspiratory muscles so that respiratory effort can be continuously optimized during MV. This project aims to
develop a comprehensive blood flow index, oxygenation, and metabolic measurement platform for inspiratory
muscle physiology by integrating wideband frequency-domain diffuse optical spectroscopy (wbDOS) and diffuse
correlation spectroscopy (DCS) to tackle this unmet need. wbDOS is a new all-digital frequency-domain DOS
technique that captures amplitude and phase measurements over a wide bandwidth of modulation frequencies
(50-500 MHz) at high speeds (>100 Hz). wbDOS and DCS will combine synergistically to provide pathlength-
corrected estimates of absolute Hb/Mb concentrations and blood flow index (BFi), allowing for the extraction of
tissue regional oxygen metabolic rate (MRO2i), a parameter directly linked to oxygen utilization. We hypothesize
that wbDOS and DCS measurements can be acquired simultaneously at high speed (>10 Hz) with parallel
detection and integrated electronics. This speed is needed to capture inspiratory/expiratory dynamics at the
respiratory rate. Additionally, we hypothesize wideband frequency-domain DOS measurements will provide
improved quantification of optical properties, BFi and MRO2i when optically integrated with DCS as compared to
single frequency FD-DOS or CW-NIRS. We will validate this through rigorous system testing using flow-channel
tissue-mimicking optical phantoms. A multi-layer inverse model will be developed to better capture inspiratory
muscle metabolism by accounting for subcutaneous lipid thickness and skin tones. We will also expand on our
recent work in Deep Neural Network (DNN) processing to develop high-speed algorithms for calculating Hb/Mb
concentrations, StO2 (%), BFi (mm2/s), and MRO2i at 10 Hz. We will conduct a feasibility study (n=10) of healthy
volunteers during respiratory muscle loading and unloading to evaluate performance compared to expected
trends. It is anticipated that completion of these aims will yield a novel and comprehensive blood flow index,
oxygenation, and metabolic measurement platform (wbDOS-DCS) and lead to subsequent R01-scale funding.

"Project Summary
Sarcopenia, a condition characterized by loss of muscle mass and function in the elderly, is of increasing
relevance in the United States due to its aging population. It is generally agreed that the weakening of the muscle
in sarcopenia cannot be explained by loss of muscle mass alone, but the mechanisms behind this remain poorly
understood. This is partly due to the lack of non-invasive techniques for observing muscle structure and
composition in high detail. We propose to develop MRI techniques to measure muscle morphology,
microstructure, and fat content to get a detailed view of the changes in muscle quantity and quality in patients
with sarcopenia and how they relate to more easily attainable measurements of muscle function such as grip
strength and gait speed. This would provide an important contribution to the ongoing debate about how such
measurements could be used to define sarcopenia, which would pave the way for treatment development.
We aim to develop novel methods to investigate the structure and composition of muscle using ultra-high-field
MRI. Specifically, we aim to (1) obtain water-based images of skeletal muscle macro- and microstructure with
unparalleled efficiency, image quality, and resolution; (2) obtain images of the spatial distribution of
intramyocellular lipids in skeletal muscle, measuring both methyl and methylene to estimate saturation; and (3)
to conduct a study comparing skeletal muscle structure and quality by looking at MR measurements of T2
relaxation rates, diffusivity (as proxies for inflammation and fiber size, respectively), fat fraction, and lipid
composition, in subjects with sarcopenia and healthy controls and see how these quantities correlate to muscle
function.
This project has several innovative aspects. First, we will develop a method to estimate muscle morphology, T2
relaxation rates, and diffusivity with a single MRI sequence. Importantly, this will make the developed method
easy to run at other MRI sites. Second, we will devise methods to perform robust, efficient imaging of
intramyocellular lipid droplet distribution and saturation in human skeletal muscle in vivo at high field. Both of
these methods will have unparalleled signal-to-noise ratio and robustness against image artifacts. The
significance of this work is the investigation of the role of inflammation, fiber size, and lipid distribution in the
weakening of muscle in sarcopenia and how these measurements are related to muscle function. The resulting
conclusions and techniques may help establish a common standard for the definition of sarcopenia and aid in
the development of future treatments for this condition. 3-Dimensional;Affect;Age;Awareness;Biological Markers;Clinical;Communities;Consensus;Data;Development;Diagnostic;Diffuse;Diffusion;Elderly;Evaluation;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Fiber;Fracture;Frequencies;Future;Gait speed;Geriatrics;Goals;Hand Strength;Health;Health Personnel;Hospitalization;Human;Image;Imaging Techniques;Inflammation;Investigation;Life Expectancy;Lipids;Machine Learning;Magnetic Resonance;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measurement;Measures;Medical Imaging;Metabolic;Metabolic Marker;Methods;Morphologic artifacts;Morphology;Muscle;Muscle function;Muscular Atrophy;Noise;Patients;Phase;Physiologic pulse;Predisposition;Prevalence;Protons;Proxy;Relaxation;Research;Resolution;Role;Running;Signal Transduction;Site;Skeletal Muscle;Soleus Muscle;Spatial Distribution;Spectrum Analysis;Structure;Techniques;Testing;Time;Tissues;Treatment Effectiveness;United States;Water;Work;aging population;base;bone imaging;carbene;clinical biomarkers;design;falls;imaging biomarker;imaging modality;improved;in vivo;innovation;muscle form;muscle strength;muscular structure;novel;potential biomarker;quantitative imaging;radio frequency;recruit;sarcopenia;spectroscopic imaging;therapy development Quantitative and Spectroscopic Imaging of Skeletal Muscle Changes in Sarcopenia at High Field","Project Summary

"Project Summary
After nearly five decades of human voice research, much remains unknown regarding muscle control mechanism
of voice production. Studies confirmed that vocal fold pre-phonatory posture (geometry, position, tension and
stiffness) is among the primary factors controlling vocal fold vibratory dynamics and voice type. However, very
limited data is available on muscle control of these properties, primarily due to experimental difficulties. Muscle
control of glottic geometry and dynamics has been studied in in vivo human and animal models, but these studies
were limited to an endoscopic superior view, thus cannot to provide 3D deformation/movement of the vocal folds.
Moreover, tension and stiffness of the vocal fold tissues are very difficult to obtain in vivo due to a lack of reliable
techniques. A significant knowledge gap remains regarding how intrinsic laryngeal muscles (ILMs) control voice
production through vocal fold posturing as well as how ILM dysfunctions, such as vocal fold paralysis/paresis
(VFP), affect voice production by altering vocal fold posturing.
In this project, we propose to use an innovative approach that integrates experimental data and state-of-the-art
computer modeling techniques to produce a complete dataset of 3D vocal fold postures (geometry, position,
tension, stiffness), 3D vocal fold vibratory dynamics, and voice outcomes in the full muscle control space
including symmetric, asymmetric and compensative muscle activations. The PI’s group recently developed a
state-of-the-art, physics based, 3D computer model that integrates realistic laryngeal anatomy, physiologically
quantifiable inputs, inverse material parameterization and machine learning for simulating vocal fold posturing
and flow-structure-acoustics interaction (FSAI) during voice production. For this project, we propose to combine
this embodied model with experimental data to generate a holistic view of vocal fold posturing and FSAI with
great temporal and spatial details in the full muscle control space. In particular, the model will reveal the 3D
complexity of vocal fold postures and vibrations and provide measures of tension and stiffness with muscle
activations, which have not been available.
We propose to use the dataset to elucidate causal links among muscle activity, vocal fold posturing, vocal fold
vibration and voice outcome. Muscle combinations with distinct posturing, vibration and acoustic patterns will be
identified. The new knowledge is expected to elucidate the muscle control mechanism of voice production
through vocal fold posturing. The proposed work has the potential to improve insight into the function and
dysfunction of the ILMs and to serve as a foundation for novel, targeted therapeutic approaches. We hope to
develop possible biomechanical metrics for the diagnosis and optimal methodology for treatment of VFP. 3-Dimensional;Acoustics;Affect;Anatomy;Animal Model;Biomechanics;Canis familiaris;Computer Models;Consultations;Data;Data Set;Development;Diagnosis;Dimensions;Doctor of Medicine;Etiology;Financial compensation;Foundations;Functional disorder;Geometry;Human;Knowledge;Laryngeal muscle structure;Larynx;Link;MRI Scans;Machine Learning;Measures;Methodology;Modeling;Movement;Muscle;Otolaryngology;Outcome;Paralysed;Paresis;Pattern;Physics;Physiological;Population;Positioning Attribute;Posture;Production;Property;Research;Structure;Students;Techniques;Testing;Tissues;Universities;Voice;Voice Disorders;Work;base;clinically relevant;experimental study;human model;improved;in vivo;innovation;insight;novel;optimal treatments;professor;simulation;targeted treatment;vibration;vocal cord Muscle Control Mechanism of Voice Production in Vocal Fold Paralysis","Project Summary

"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The capacity for muscle regeneration decreases markedly with aging. While regeneration is led by muscle
stem cells (MuSC), complex age-related changes in the skeletal muscle extracellular matrix (ECM) provide
potent signals that drive aberrant lineage specification. The complexity of the interactions between aging
MuSC and their environmental niche defined by biomechanical, architectural, and dynamic changes in the
ECM suggests a data-driven analysis can elucidate underlying mechanisms, increase our fundamental
understanding of aging and stem cell biology, and point to novel therapeutic strategies. In this research, -omics
data (i.e., single cell RNA-seq and imaging flow cytometry assessments of myogenic markers) obtained from
cells cultured onto substrates of varying elasticity and cell-adhesion will be used to probe signaling pathways
including mitochondrial/metabolic signaling pathways in cultured MuSCs. We propose that the implementation
of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) paradigms represents a critical next step for integrating multi-
layer -omics datasets and building predictive models that will more comprehensively elucidate stem cell
responses to the extrinsic biophysical environment.
 The overarching goal of this Supplement is to test the central hypothesis that Biological data and domain
knowledge relating to muscle aging can be embedded in a framework of Bayesian optimization will allow for
elucidating mechanisms and accurately predicting regenerative responses. This central hypothesis will be
tested by conducting three specific aims: Specific Aim 1. To prepare -omics data for ML models: Curate
datasets, identify and impute missing data, compile metadata, and pre-process data to quantify descriptors
used in model building. Adopt data management protocols associated with best practices. Specific Aim 2. To
perform benchmark ML modeling with Bayesian optimization: Identify environmental variables (ECM stiffness
and composition, signaling molecules) and cellular characteristics (age, expression markers) that correlate with
epigenetic signatures and myogenicity, then develop mechanistic ML models and estimate posterior
distributions. Specific Aim 3. To broaden approaches to ML modeling and broaden researcher engagement in
the biology of aging: CMU will host a hackathon with teams that combine students and researchers from
regional universities and HBCU partners.

"Skeletal muscles are responsible for movement, breathing, posture and metabolism. Loss of muscle function via acute injury or chronic neuromuscular disease (NMD) is debilitating to quality of life and is associated with high healthcare burden. In the US, there are over 12 million cases of sprains and strains injuries each year, an estimated 50 million people living with age-related sarcopenia, and another 250,000 with NMDs. My long-term goal is to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms which underlie the muscle repair and develop therapies for chronic muscle disorders. A major barrier in this endeavor is our limited of understanding of the multiplicity of cell types involved during muscle regeneration. Little is known regarding functions of each cell type and how they interact with tissue-resident stem cells to regulate the restoration of muscle function. Thus, tissue cytometry, the mapping of single cells within tissues, is necessary to gain novel insights into cellular interactions during muscle regeneration and in dysregulated disease states. My central hypothesis is that local signaling in the cellular microenvironment regulate the behavior of critical cell types to remodel or repair the tissue. To this, I have optimized a novel multiplexed imaging technology (CODEX) that enables visualizes 40+ antibodies on a single muscle section. In the proposed research, I aim to (i) develop technologies to study cellular interactions using high dimensional imaging data and build a single cell resolution spatial map of the localization, abundance, dynamics, and interactions of 25 cell type within normal muscle regeneration and disease states; (ii) elucidate critical cell types and spatially-localized signaling that determine the proper expansion and differentiation of muscle stem cells; (iii) deep profile the function of M2 macrophages and fibroadipogenic precursors in process of motor neuron and neuromuscular junction remodeling. The training I will receive during the mentored phase of this proposal will be critical for the success of this project. Moreover, application of this systematic approach to study inter-cellular signaling will allow me to achieve academic independence. The proposed experiments in the K99 phase will provide novel insights into the coordinated process of tissue regeneration and will yield candidate signaling molecules with the potential to modulate the function of muscle stem cells.
