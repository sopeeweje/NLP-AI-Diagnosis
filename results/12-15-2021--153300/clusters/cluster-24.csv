"DEVELOPMENT PSYCHOBIOLOGY OF SLEEP AND DEPRESSION DESCRIPTION (Adapted from applicant's abstract):  This K02 application           out-lines research and career development plans to investigate the role of       sleep regulation in the developmental psychobiology of affective disorders.      The first goal is to extend a well-established line of research based on         measures of EEG sleep and cortisol in child and adolescent depression by         investigating:  (1) abnormalities in sleep and cortisol regulation focusing      on the sleep-onset transition; (2) normal maturational changes in sleep and      cortisol regulation relevant to these abnormalities; and (3) the predictive      validity of sleep and cortisol abnormalities in longitudinal clinical            follow-up.                                                                                                                                                        The second goal is to further develop and investigate a larger developmental     model of sleep regulation.  The model emphasizes close links between sleep       regulation and neurobehavioral systems involved in the regulation of affect      and arousal which are modulated in regions of prefrontal cortex (PFC).           Matur-ational changes in PFC-subcortical circuits influencing sleep,             arousal, and affect are hypothesized to contribute to sleep changes              associated with depression, particularly near the transition from                wakefulness into sleep.  Based on this model, predictions are made regarding     sleep changes in the development of affective disorders and effects of sleep     deprivation of affective regulation.  The long-term goal of this work is to      understand mechanisms of dysregulation which may lead to more effective          treatment of early onset affective disorders.                                                                                                                     Career development activities to support these goals are described.  Further     advancing this line of investigation will require increased knowledge and        skills in four areas:  the development of affect regulation; the relevant        neurocircuitry and its development; more direct measures of the neural           systems of interest; and statistics.

"Automated (AI) Analysis of Sleep Disordered Breathing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This training grant is designed to advance the academic career of Dr. Indu Ayappa by building on the applicant?s strong biomedical engineering and computer background and providing comprehensive multi-disciplinary training which will allow her to become an independent investigator. The applicant?s career goals are to enter full time academic research in sleep physiology. Training activities proposed will include academic course work designed to support the research program and expose her to aspects of clinical research in sleep, neural science and artificial intelligence techniques. She will be mentored by David Rapoport, M.D., Joyce Walsleben, Ph.D., and Maurice Ohayon, M.D., Ph.D., as well as faculty in computer science and neurophysiology. The aims of the planned research are to develop an artificial intelligence system for the identification and quantification of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) based solely on non-invasive cardiopulmonary signals collected during routine polysomnography. This will simplify, standardize and improve the diagnosis of SDB and facilitate research in this area. With the long term goal of physiologic characterization of the spectrum of SDB in order to clinically diagnose upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), the aims of this project are to: 1. Extract features from the nasal cannula airflow signal to characterize the state of resistance/collapsibility of individual breaths. These include amplitude, inspiratory flow contour, Ti/Ttot and presence of vibration which will be used as inputs to a neural network that will be trained and evaluated against breaths that have been classified by reference measurement of upper airway resistance (pressure/flow). 2A.

"Machine Learned Breath Sound Signatures for Obstructive Sleep Apnea Abstract  Sleep disordered breathing and in particular obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a major cause of workplace accidents, liability and days lost from work. Prevalence is rising with 30 million American sufferers alone. Despite this epidemic – or perhaps because of it – up to 40% of sufferers are undiagnosed and untreated. Lack of screening tools is a major bottleneck, since validated diagnostic tests of polysomnography (PSG) or home sleep testing (HST) have limited availability and are expensive and cumbersome. Simpler, widely applicable screening should be developed to identify individuals in the workplace at high-risk for SDB, for rapid triage to diagnostic testing and therapy.  Our central scientific hypothesis is that OSA produces characteristic acoustic signatures, determined algorithmically in time- and frequency- domain analyses of ambient sound and by machine-learned networks, which can be used to screen for OSA. Our central business hypothesis is that such analysis should be possible using a consumer smartphone with no additional equipment. This work uses data available from our completed, IRB-approved study of 223 individuals at risk for OSA who underwent gold-standard sleep tests (PSG), providing multi-channel physiologic data on breathing health, and in parallel whole-night breath sound recordings from a smartphone. Aim 1 is a big-data approach to create an acoustic taxonomy, i.e. classification of breath sounds recorded by a smartphone, calibrated as normal, shallow, obstructed and absent using multichannel physiological data on the time-matched clinical PSG. Our team comprises trained sleep medicine physicians, occupational health providers, translational scientists and software developers. We will develop a library of acoustic signatures for loud gasping/choking/absent sounds characteristic of OSA and separate them from normal breath sounds. Aim 2 will develop a machine-learned respiratory index, using these acoustic signatures to track severity of OSA from concurrent all-night PSG, which predicts OSA severity in a separate validation cohort from our IRB-approved study. Supervised learning using convolutional neural networks will be used to derive the respiratory index.  The significance of this proposal, scientifically, is that it will define digital acoustic signatures of disturbed from normal breaths and breathing patterns and, from an occupational health and business perspective, will use these tools to develop a widely accessible, rapid and efficient screening tool for sleep disordered breathing. Successful completion of this project may reduce the burden of workplace accidents from sleep disordered breathing. This project may shift the paradigm towards crowd-based screening and novel management strategies for this public health epidemic. Machine Learned Breath Sound Signatures for Obstructive Sleep Apnea Narrative Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a major cause of daytime somnolence, work-related injury and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The condition has few widely applicable screening tools, yet may affect over 30 million Americans and in the workforce may cause catastrophic injury and liability from operating heavy industry or truck driving. This project will use machine learning and signal-processing to analyze breathing sound and separate patients without SDB from those with normal, mild and severe SDB, which may ultimately be applied on wearable devices for screening.",Machine Learned Breath Sound Signatures for Obstructive Sleep Apnea,9678943,R43DP006418,[' '],NCCDPHP,"RESONEA, INC.",R43,2018,224926,0.333713705267231
"CRCNS: Integrated Empirical and Multi-scale Modeling of Human Sleep Spindles DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neural oscillations organize cortico-thalamic activity, and their role in memory, attention and sleep are a central focus of systems neuroscience. Sleep spindles are among the most prominent oscillations, and have been studied at many levels of investigation, from the biophysical level, where the low threshold calcium currents are implicated in the waxing-and-waning 11-15 Hz bursts of spikes that originate in the thalamus and recruit cortical circuits, to the systems level where the electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) measured outside the skull register largescale spatial and temporal coherence in the bursting pattern across the cortex (Destexhe and Sejnowski, 2001). Despite the wealth of physiological, anatomical and computational studies, major questions remain to be resolved: How do nearby parts of the cortex become synchronized during spindles? How are spindles propagated across the cortex? Why is there a discrepancy between the temporal patterns of spindles simultaneously observed in EEG and MEG measurements? What are the consequences of spindle activity in thalamocortical systems for cortical reorganization and memory consolidation during sleep?

"CRCNS: Integrated Empirical and Multi-scale Modeling of Human Sleep Spindles DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neural oscillations organize cortico-thalamic activity, and their role in memory, attention and sleep are a central focus of systems neuroscience. Sleep spindles are among the most prominent oscillations, and have been studied at many levels of investigation, from the biophysical level, where the low threshold calcium currents are implicated in the waxing-and-waning 11-15 Hz bursts of spikes that originate in the thalamus and recruit cortical circuits, to the systems level where the electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) measured outside the skull register largescale spatial and temporal coherence in the bursting pattern across the cortex (Destexhe and Sejnowski, 2001). Despite the wealth of physiological, anatomical and computational studies, major questions remain to be resolved: How do nearby parts of the cortex become synchronized during spindles? How are spindles propagated across the cortex? Why is there a discrepancy between the temporal patterns of spindles simultaneously observed in EEG and MEG measurements? What are the consequences of spindle activity in thalamocortical systems for cortical reorganization and memory consolidation during sleep?

"CRCNS: Integrated Empirical and Multiscale Modeling of Human Sleep Spindles    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to determine how brain events at the biophysical level in the human brain influence the macroscopic recordings outside the skull. The specific focus is on sleep spindles, the best studied sleep rhythm, for which we will obtain simultaneous EEG, MEG and depth electrode recordings. These empirical data will be analyzed to determine the laminar sources of the currents within the cortex associated with spindles and these results will be matched to predictions from computational models. We will develop three types of related network models to cover a wide range of spatial scales. The working hypotheses are, first, that spindles are generated by multiple loosely-coupled cortical regions through rhythmic activation of thalamocortical afferents, onto superficial cortical layers from the matrix system, and onto middle layers from the core system, and second, that spindle oscillations in restricted thalamocortical domains in the core system are spread via the matrix system. Empirical Specific Aims and Hypotheses 1) Record MEG and EEG simultaneously during sleep spindles. Hypothesis: MEG and EEG will record very different activity patterns at the sensor level and in their inferred sources. Poor correlation will be apparent as inconstant phase and amplitude relations within spindle discharges, as well as only loose correlations as to when spindles occur. 2) Record from intracranial EEG macro-electrodes during sleep spindles, with simultaneous scalp EEG and MEG recordings. Hypothesis: Recordings from different cortical generators will be only loosely coupled with each other, or with scalp EEG, thus supporting the general view suggested by MEG. 3) Record from intracranial microelectrode arrays during sleep spindles. Hypothesis: Neuronal generator currents vary during each spindle between superficial and middle layers. 4) Reconstruct supragranular and infragranular pyramidal cells from association cortex in humans, determine their laminar distribution, and estimate the likely termination zones of core and matrix thalamocortical projections. Hypothesis: Significant anatomical differences will be found between human association cortex and the rodent sensory cortex. Modeling Specific Aims and Hypotheses 1) Construct accurate, realistic EEG/MEG forward solutions based on cortical reconstruction from structural MRI. Hypothesis: Basic parameters of extracranial EEG/MEG can be replicated by modeling multiple thalamocortical domains with varying synchrony between domains. The values of the fit parameters to EEG/MEG will match those inferred from intracranial macroelectrode recordings. 2) Analyze the recorded cortical Current Source Density (CSD) using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Model the CSD patterns expected from the matrix and core thalamocortical afferents using reconstructions of supragranular and infragranular pyramidal cells, their population distribution, and terminations of matrix and core afferents. Hypothesis: The main spatiotemporal CSD components contributing to the spindle identified with PCA will correspond to the CSD components modeled to result from activation of matrix and core thalamocortical afferents. 3) Construct neuronal models based on Hodgkin-Huxley ionic currents that include cortical cells, thalamic reticular nuclear cells, matrix and core thalamic relay cells, and their interconnections in a minicolumn. Hypothesis: The spatiotemporal patterns of currents predicted in different cortical layers will match those obtained using the methods described in modeling aim 2. 4) Scale up the cortical minicolumn network model using simplified neural models to a spatially accurate cortical model that can generate EEG/MEG patterns. Hypothesis: The predicted EEG and MEG from the model will match those observed in recordings, with the involvement of matrix vs core thalamocortical systems corresponding to the parameters derived in modeling aim 1. 5) Develop a statistical model that matches the properties of the scaled up model and analyze it with methods from statistical physics. Hypothesis: The matrix system controls the effective cortical connectivity and the core system controls the local correlation length. Collaborative research Recordings from humans will be performed at MGH (Cash), with analysis and modeling at UCSD (Halgren and Sejnowski).

"CRCNS: Integrated Empirical and Multiscale Modeling of Human Sleep Spindles    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to determine how brain events at the biophysical level in the human brain influence the macroscopic recordings outside the skull. The specific focus is on sleep spindles, the best studied sleep rhythm, for which we will obtain simultaneous EEG, MEG and depth electrode recordings. These empirical data will be analyzed to determine the laminar sources of the currents within the cortex associated with spindles and these results will be matched to predictions from computational models. We will develop three types of related network models to cover a wide range of spatial scales. The working hypotheses are, first, that spindles are generated by multiple loosely-coupled cortical regions through rhythmic activation of thalamocortical afferents, onto superficial cortical layers from the matrix system, and onto middle layers from the core system, and second, that spindle oscillations in restricted thalamocortical domains in the core system are spread via the matrix system. Empirical Specific Aims and Hypotheses 1) Record MEG and EEG simultaneously during sleep spindles. Hypothesis: MEG and EEG will record very different activity patterns at the sensor level and in their inferred sources. Poor correlation will be apparent as inconstant phase and amplitude relations within spindle discharges, as well as only loose correlations as to when spindles occur. 2) Record from intracranial EEG macro-electrodes during sleep spindles, with simultaneous scalp EEG and MEG recordings. Hypothesis: Recordings from different cortical generators will be only loosely coupled with each other, or with scalp EEG, thus supporting the general view suggested by MEG. 3) Record from intracranial microelectrode arrays during sleep spindles. Hypothesis: Neuronal generator currents vary during each spindle between superficial and middle layers. 4) Reconstruct supragranular and infragranular pyramidal cells from association cortex in humans, determine their laminar distribution, and estimate the likely termination zones of core and matrix thalamocortical projections. Hypothesis: Significant anatomical differences will be found between human association cortex and the rodent sensory cortex. Modeling Specific Aims and Hypotheses 1) Construct accurate, realistic EEG/MEG forward solutions based on cortical reconstruction from structural MRI. Hypothesis: Basic parameters of extracranial EEG/MEG can be replicated by modeling multiple thalamocortical domains with varying synchrony between domains. The values of the fit parameters to EEG/MEG will match those inferred from intracranial macroelectrode recordings. 2) Analyze the recorded cortical Current Source Density (CSD) using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Model the CSD patterns expected from the matrix and core thalamocortical afferents using reconstructions of supragranular and infragranular pyramidal cells, their population distribution, and terminations of matrix and core afferents. Hypothesis: The main spatiotemporal CSD components contributing to the spindle identified with PCA will correspond to the CSD components modeled to result from activation of matrix and core thalamocortical afferents. 3) Construct neuronal models based on Hodgkin-Huxley ionic currents that include cortical cells, thalamic reticular nuclear cells, matrix and core thalamic relay cells, and their interconnections in a minicolumn. Hypothesis: The spatiotemporal patterns of currents predicted in different cortical layers will match those obtained using the methods described in modeling aim 2. 4) Scale up the cortical minicolumn network model using simplified neural models to a spatially accurate cortical model that can generate EEG/MEG patterns. Hypothesis: The predicted EEG and MEG from the model will match those observed in recordings, with the involvement of matrix vs core thalamocortical systems corresponding to the parameters derived in modeling aim 1. 5) Develop a statistical model that matches the properties of the scaled up model and analyze it with methods from statistical physics. Hypothesis: The matrix system controls the effective cortical connectivity and the core system controls the local correlation length. Collaborative research Recordings from humans will be performed at MGH (Cash), with analysis and modeling at UCSD (Halgren and Sejnowski).

"Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study ABSTRACT Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are all highly prevalent in the US population and are associated with significant morbidity, including poor mental health, impaired neurocognitive function, metabolic dysregulation, and cardiovascular disease. In the context of the high prevalence of pernicious sleep disturbances, there is evidence that sleep disparities exist in the population, such that racial/ethnic minorities – including Mexican-Americans – are at increased risk of sleep disturbances. This is alarming, since this group is also at increased risk for many of the adverse cardiometabolic and functional outcomes linked to sleep disturbances. These associations may be influenced by economic hardship, psychosocial stress, unhealthy behaviors (diet, exercise, alcohol, and smoking), and acculturation – the degree to which an individual adopts (in this case) traditional Mexican versus American culture. The first goal of this project is to examine sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and sleep apnea severity among Mexican-Americans and examine the role of these social-behavioral factors in this relationship. Second, this study aims to examine the role of sleep and cardiometabolic disease risk in this population and explore the role of acculturation, psychosocial stress, economic hardship, and/or unhealthy behaviors in these associations. To accomplish this, this project will partner with the Mariposa Community Health Center, the federally qualified clinic in the Nogales, AZ area. Nogales is a small city on the US/Mexico border that is an ideal location for studying non-urban Mexican- Americans, as it is made up of 83% Hispanics/Latinos, 33% immigrants, and 77% who primarily speak Spanish at home. This community-engaged project will partner with Mariposa and their Platicamos Salud program that uses experienced Community Health Workers (promotoras de salud) to collect data and perform home visits. The study will recruit N=900 Mexican-Americans and N=200 Non-Hispanic Whites to complete a battery of assessments from a clinic visit (questionnaires, interviews, exam for anthropometry and arterial stiffness, and collection of biomarkers), a 1-night home sleep apnea assessment, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording, and a 2-week home monitoring period with sleep diary and actigraphy. This will result in a rich dataset that can help to identify and reduce sleep disparities in the population and point to potential intervention approaches to reducing cardiometabolic disease disparities. The analytic plan will take advantage of a machine-learning analytic approach, which will be used to evaluate the complex relationships among all of these variables. This project will address many relevant issues in sleep medicine, health disparities research, and border health. The partnership with Mariposa will enhance recruitment, promote research integrity (or ensure appropriateness of research methods), and facilitate dissemination of the study results into the community through education programs associated with Platicamos Salud and other community outreach efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE The primary goal of this study is to assess sleep health among Mexican-Americans at the US/Mexico border, characterize relationships with cardiometabolic disease risk, and investigate the role of social-environmental factors including acculturation, stress, socioeconomics, and health behaviors. Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are highly prevalent in the population. These conditions are associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, daytime functioning problems, and poor mental health. Disparities in sleep health in racial/ethnic minorities exist, including Mexican-Americans. In particular, social-environmental factors at the US-Mexico border may play an important role in sleep health disparities. This project will not only allow for increased understanding of the complex relationship among sleep, health, and social-environmental pressures, but through a community partnership it can maximize our ability to reduce these disparities.

"Administrative Supplement for Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study ABSTRACT This application is in response to NOT-MD-19-023, which calls for proposals for expanding recruitment of projects to include Native Hawaiians / Other Pacific Islanders (NH/OPIs). Sleep disturbances, including short sleep duration, sleep apnea, and insomnia disorder, are highly prevalent among adults in the US and are associated with an increased risk for mental and physical health consequences including cardiometabolic disease. Comparative research studies indicate that sleep disparities are present in some minority populations; however, the extent to which sleep disparities exist across different racial/ethnic groups is not well known. Both Mexican-Americans and individuals from Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (NH/OPI) populations are at an increased risk for adverse sleep and corresponding cardiometabolic health outcomes, yet the role of potential mechanisms linking such deficiencies in these comparative minority groups is understudied. Factors that impact sleep functioning in one population may differentially impact another population. The overall goal of this project is to support and strengthen two aims of the parent grant by specifically including NH/OPI into the Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep study to further evaluate how acculturation, psychosocial stressors, and other social, environmental, and behavioral factors impact relationships between sleep disturbances and cardiometabolic disease risk similarly and uniquely, as compared to Mexican-Americans at the US/Mexico border. This project aims to determine how acculturation, economic hardship, psychosocial stress, and unhealthy behaviors (diet, exercise, alcohol, and smoking) are related to sleep disturbance by type in NH/OPI and in comparison to these relationships in Mexican-Americans. The second goal of this project is to determine how sleep and/or social-behavioral factors predict cardiometabolic disease risk among NH/OPI, as well as determine how these same factors are different in NH/OPI when compared to Mexican-Americans at the US/Mexico border. To accomplish these goals, this project will partner with researchers at the University of Hawaii to recruit and enroll N=100 NH/OPI to complete a battery of assessments from a clinic visit (questionnaires, interviews, exam for anthropometry, collection of biomarkers), a 1-night home sleep apnea assessment, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording, and a 2-week home monitoring period with sleep diary and actigraphy. Inclusion of NH/OPI into the larger dataset will facilitate a better understanding of sleep disturbances and the impact of factors that regulate sleep, including duration, insomnia symptoms, and obstructive sleep apnea, in relation to cardiometabolic disease risk within this population and in comparison to Mexican-Americans. The analytic plan will utilize a machine-learning analytic approach, which will be used to evaluate the complex relationships among all of these variables. This project will further address efforts at reducing sleep-cardiometabolic health disparities in minority populations by identifying potentially modifiable areas associated with community-based intervention programs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sleep disturbances are common and related to important health outcomes. This project expands the parent project by adding additional information regarding how sleep plays an important role in linking social/ environmental factors such as acculturation, stress, and health behaviors to cardiometabolic risk factors. Specifically, by expanding this project to include Native Hawaiians / Other Pacific Islanders, we can obtain new information about these relationships.",Administrative Supplement for Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study,9978525,R01MD011600,"['Acculturation', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Anthropometry', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinic Visits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Exclusion', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Hawaii', 'Hawaiian population', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mexican', 'Mexican Americans', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Native Hawaiian', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Participant', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Smoking', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'base', 'cardiometabolic risk', 'cardiometabolism', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'comparative', 'design', 'diaries', 'diet and exercise', 'disorder risk', 'environmental stressor', 'ethnic identity', 'experience', 'food security', 'functional disability', 'health assessment', 'health disparity', 'intervention program', 'low density lipoprotein triglyceride', 'mortality', 'parent grant', 'parent project', 'perceived stress', 'physical conditioning', 'psychosocial', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'research study', 'response', 'sleep health', 'social', 'stressor']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2019,124869,0.48003095459603484
"Enhanced Measurement and Modeling of Sleep Electrophysiology to Better Understand Sleep Disparities Project Summary Health disparities associated with race and ethnicity are a major public health issue in the United States. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that differences in people's quality and quantity of sleep may account for part of this problem. Here we wish to study patterns of sleep, using full polysomnography data in a large and diverse cohort, to better understand what causes some individuals and groups to differ in their typical sleep, and to link this variation in sleep to relevant health outcomes. In order to study sleep as a mediator of health disparities associated with race/ethnicity, we propose to first unpack the “sleep” term into profiles of quantitative traits (Aim 1). Second, we will test for demographic moderators of the associations between race/ethnicity and sleep traits, which can point to likely socioeconomic and social/environmental contextual mediators (Aim 2). Finally, we will demonstrate the relevance of these findings by testing for association with health outcomes – primarily cardiovascular disease risk and measures of allostatic load – and estimating the extent to which sleep accounts for racial/ethnic health disparities (Aim 3). We will apply a targeted array of data-driven analytic methods, from data science, machine learning, computational neuroscience and causal modeling, to characterize individual differences in patterns of sleep. A more nuanced understanding of what constitutes “poor sleep” is important because different aspects of sleep are likely to have qualitatively different links to demographic and biomedical factors, including age, sex, lifestyle factors, inherited genetic makeup, circadian rhythms, medication effects and current state of physical and mental health. By disentangling this network of inter-related variables, we will be better positioned to understand – and ameliorate – the effects of the numerous factors that can induce racial/ethnic disparities in sleep, and consequently, in health too.

"PORTABLE DROWSINESS MONITORING DEVICE DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's abstract) The feasibility of a Drowsiness              Monitoring Device (DMD) to detect EEG indices of drowsiness in real-             time, was demonstrated during Phase I with an analytical model correctly         classifying 97.1 percent of sleep episodes and 94.3 percent of awake             epochs in 20 sleep-deprived subjects. The model employs discriminant             function analysis (DFA) to characterize and classify one-sec epochs,             validated against a combination of visual scoring by polysomnographers           and/or a behavioral measure. Algorithms to detect artifacts in real-time         (EMG, 60-Hz and gross body/eye movements) were developed. This                   classification accuracy represents a significant advancement over                previously reported models and confirms the feasibility of                       distinguishing EEG characteristics of sleep and waking on a second-by-           second basis. Phase II will implement a three-level DFA classification           system to further refine the model, adding sub-class states for                  vigilance and drowsiness/sleep to improve system accuracy. The multi-            dimensional time-series DFA analyses will correlate EEG parameters with          behavioral measures of driving performance to provide quantitative               predictions of performance decrements associate with sleep onset.                The model will be validated using a population with demographics                 consistent with the target market for the DMD (e.g., truck drivers)              during Phase II. In addition, the system will be evaluated with the              introduction of commonly used legal drugs (caffeine, nicotine, and cold          medications) to determine the robustness of the model.                                                                                                            PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:                                                 The DMD provides three levels of user safety.

"PORTABLE DROWSINESS MONITORING DEVICE DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's abstract) The feasibility of a Drowsiness              Monitoring Device (DMD) to detect EEG indices of drowsiness in real-             time, was demonstrated during Phase I with an analytical model correctly         classifying 97.1 percent of sleep episodes and 94.3 percent of awake             epochs in 20 sleep-deprived subjects. The model employs discriminant             function analysis (DFA) to characterize and classify one-sec epochs,             validated against a combination of visual scoring by polysomnographers           and/or a behavioral measure.

"EXPERT SYSTEM FOR AROUSAL SCORING DURING SLEEP DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An expert software system is proposed that will analyze digital polysomnographic data and identify EEG arousals based on standard criteria (ASDA report: EEG Arousals: Scoring Rules and Examples, Sleep, 1992). The algorithm logic closely follows the scoring rules so that information from intermediate steps leading up to the fmal decision will be made available to the operator. Phase I research will test three innovative techniques for marking abrupt changes of EEG frequency corresponding to arousal: techniques based on spectrogram, ""Time Frequency Distribution"", and ""Instantaneous frequency"". Optimal criteria will be established for discrimination of polysomnogram sections with and without arousal. A database of sixteen manually scored full night sleep records will be established with at least 1200 arousal events.

"Application of Machine Vision to Determine the Influence of Sleep States and Social Interactions on Vulnerability to Drug Addiction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The long-term goal of this project is to develop a technology that will allow addiction researchers to measure the influence of social and sleep behaviors on drug intake behavior in large-scale genomic experiments to discover genes that regulate vulnerability to addiction. To accomplish this we will develop and make publicly available a highly innovative technology that, for the first time, will allow researchers to continuously monitor complex sleep and social behaviors in groups of mice, using low-cost and easily scaled video equipment. While drug-addiction behaviors have well-established bidirectional relationships with these behaviors, the genetic etiologies have not been fully elucidated. This critical gap is primarily due to technological barriers that prevent reliable phenotyping of large numbers of animals for specific sleep states and social behaviors. Currently available methods for assessing different sleep states are designed to be used with isolated animals and do not measure multiple individuals in a group. Although social context is known to be an influence on addiction vulnerability, it has been largely studied by changing the housing environment and testing isolated animals. We will exploit techniques of artificial intelligence to develop a neural network-based machine-vision method of video analysis of these behaviors, designed to be used in an ethologically-relevant group setting, over long periods of time. This non-invasive method will be a significant advance in behavioral phenotyping, fulfilling the demands of the high-throughput genetic studies necessary for optimizing the mouse as model of addiction. Our first specific aim is to develop a machine-vision method to measure rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, nonREM (NREM) sleep and waking behaviors of all individuals, for use in either single or group housed conditions. We will train and validate our machine-vision networks using EEG and EMG recordings. To demonstrate the utility and assess the performance of our method we will compare two different mouse lines (the control mouse C57Bl/6J and a genetically altered strain, B6.129P2-Nos2 tm1Lau/J) that are known to differ in these sleep parameters. We will compare the sleep of these two mouse strains in both group and single housing. Our second specific aim is to extend our method to enable assessment of group social dynamics and to record all social and active behaviors over multiple days. This will allow us to test the bidirectional effects of social and sleep behaviors with the consumption of self-administered methamphetamine. We will assess the effect of initial social status and sleep quality on drug consumption and also measure how the social interactions and sleep patterns are changed after the drug is available. Successful completion of these aims will yield a validated technology with the capacity to provide detailed measurements of sleep and social behaviors in mice for use in large scale genetic studies, thereby significantly enhancing researchers' ability to identify genes associated with addiction susceptibility. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Despite the urgency to find better treatments for substance abuse disorders, it has been difficult to map the complex interactions between factors contributing to the differences among individuals in vulnerability to addiction. A key issue underlying this knowledge gap is the lack of a technology that can be used to analyze the behaviors of mice—which are the preeminent animal model of addiction—in groups and over long periods of time in experiments testing responses to drug consumption. In the proposed project we will develop and make publicly available an innovative, non-invasive technology incorporating advanced computational and image- analysis approaches that will enable assessment of detailed behavioral activities of genetically diverse, group- housed mice in long-term addiction-susceptibility experiments, laying the groundwork for future studies to identify genes underlying differences among individuals in susceptibility.",Application of Machine Vision to Determine the Influence of Sleep States and Social Interactions on Vulnerability to Drug Addiction,9880430,R21DA048634,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Breathing', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Heritability', 'House mice', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Inbred C57BL Mice', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Knockout Mice', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methamphetamine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Polysomnography', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'REM Sleep', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Self Administration', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Environment', 'Social Hierarchy', 'Social Interaction', 'Social status', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vertebral column', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene discovery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'limb movement', 'machine vision', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neural network', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rapid eye movement', 'response', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep pattern', 'sleep quality', 'social', 'social group', 'substance abuse treatment', 'tool']",NIDA,JACKSON LABORATORY,R21,2020,212500,0.3297385147826028

"Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year 2040. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, followed by synucleinopathies, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, biomarkers, and treatment options for these neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) proposes to leverage two previously developed technologies to create an Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS). The core components of the INSPECDS platform will be a previously developed Alertness and Memory Profiler (AMP), a recently developed Sleep Profiler, and integrated machine-learning, classification algorithms, hosted on a secure, cloud-based, infrastructure for automated data processing, analysis, and reporting. The AMP was developed and validated during a previous NIH-funded SBIR Phase I/II project for the purpose of detecting the neurocognitive effects of sleep deprivation in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. The AMP is truly unique among neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one which integrates advanced, electrophysiological measures (e.g., 24-channel, wireless EEG and ECG) during the performance of computerized neurocognitive tasks. This advanced capability permits researchers to explore real-time relations between fluctuations in alertness, discrete cognitive functions, and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits. The Sleep Profiler is an FDA-cleared, easily applied, wireless-EEG device that was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in-home sleep studies. With integrated measures of submental (chin) EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements, the Sleep Profiler is an ideal device for quantifying the characteristics of REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), which is considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy. Furthermore, the application of sophisticated, machine-learning, classification algorithms will streamline the processing and analyses of these data to derive statistical probabilities of various dementia subtypes. The overarching goal of the current, Direct-to-Phase II, SBIR project is to develop a secure, cloud-based infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and Sleep Profiler, train classification algorithms to discriminate among dementia subtypes, validate diagnostic accuracy, and integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud-based architecture.

"Molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms of the mammalian circadian clock DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The circadian clock regulates physiology and behavior and impinges on many aspects of our daily life. Nowhere is this more obvious than control of the sleep wake cycle, where clock genes have been shown to play a role in both the timing of sleep and its quality. For example, mutations in PER2 cause familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS), while mutations in  CSNK1E and CSNK1D cause FASPS and delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS),  respectively. However, while we have learned much about the clock and how it regulates sleep, the picture is incomplete. Behavioral studies in mice and studies in human cells show that dozens to hundreds of loci impact circadian clock function. However, only a dozen genes have been investigated for their roles in regulating behavior. Testing dozens to hundreds of mice isn't practical, so a new approach is needed. Here we seek to address this gap with a novel strategy that uses, i) integrative bioinformatics to prioritize putative core clock factors, ii) new experimental methods to determine whether they interact with known clock genes and regulate clock function in several cellular or tissue slice models, and, finally, iii) for a subset of promising candidates, generate mouse models and test them for their roles in regulating circadian behavior and sleep. Completion of this research will improve our understanding of circadian rhythms and sleep and may point the way to new therapeutic targets for related disorders in humans. Our internal biological clocks control many important aspects of our physiology and behavior such as the sleep-wake cycle. Genetics and large-scale genomic studies have implicated the role of a dozen canonical and hundreds of additional new genes in the circadian clock.  However, almost none of the new genes have been studied in animal models for their ability to regulate sleep onset or quality.

"Molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms of the mammalian circadian clock     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The circadian clock regulates physiology and behavior and impinges on many aspects of our daily life. Nowhere is this more obvious than control of the sleep wake cycle, where clock genes have been shown to play a role in both the timing of sleep and its quality. For example, mutations in PER2 cause familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS), while mutations in  CSNK1E and CSNK1D cause FASPS and delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS),  respectively. However, while we have learned much about the clock and how it regulates sleep, the picture is incomplete. Behavioral studies in mice and studies in human cells show that dozens to hundreds of loci impact circadian clock function. However, only a dozen genes have been investigated for their roles in regulating behavior. Testing dozens to hundreds of mice isn't practical, so a new approach is needed. Here we seek to address this gap with a novel strategy that uses, i) integrative bioinformatics to prioritize putative core clock factors, ii) new experimental methods to determine whether they interact with known clock genes and regulate clock function in several cellular or tissue slice models, and, finally, iii) for a subset of promising candidates, generate mouse models and test them for their roles in regulating circadian behavior and sleep. Completion of this research will improve our understanding of circadian rhythms and sleep and may point the way to new therapeutic targets for related disorders in humans.

"The Health and Behavioral Effects of Sleep Deprivation Among the Urban Poor in India Project Summary/Abstract Evidence demonstrates that sleep deprivation causes impaired cognitive function and is associated with impaired health (e.g. altered immune and cardiovascular function). Yet these conclusions largely derive from correlational relationships or studies of acute sleep deprivation lasting only a few days in sleep labs. Further, research on sleep in disadvantaged populations and sleep disparities is limited, despite severe environmental challenges to sleep among the poor. Moreover, the potentially bi-directional relationship between poor sleep and poor decision-making, a possible mediator of the income-health gradient, remains largely unexplored.

"A non-pharmacological multi-modal therapy to improve sleep and cognition and reduce mild cognitive impairment risk Summary Our long-term goal is to improve healthcare with non-pharmacological interventions that use the science of behavior change and new Internet of Things (IoT) devices to augment clinical treatment. When you go to the doctor of the future, instead of prescribing a drug, in many cases the doctor may prescribe a software intervention guiding the patient through a process of facilitated behavior change and environmental optimization. This software approach to healthcare addresses the high-priority of providing services to individuals with limited/no access to care and for addressing the public health issues of insomnia and conversion to Mild Cognitive Impairments (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). These diseases are thought to cost the US Healthcare system more than $400 billion/year, with another $400 billion/year cost to U.S. businesses in lost productivity, sick days, and accidents. In our Phase I, we were the first research group to show that non-phase locked auditory stimulation can improve next day performance on attention measures without adversely impacting sleep organization, quality, or total sleep time. Our acoustic intervention increased the percentage and intensity of slow-wave sleep (SWS), the stage of sleep with many regenerative properties and which typically decreases with age. We have additional preliminary evidence that this sound-based intervention, played at the right time and volume during sleep, can enhance next day memory performance. Due to the accumulating support demonstrating the role that sleep quality and SWS play in conversion to MCI and AD from imaging studies, longitudinal studies, and cognitive assessments, our intervention may address both the public health issue of poor sleep quality and AD. In our Phase II, we propose to further address insomnia and AD risk by integrating our deep sleep enhancement intervention and sound masking intervetinos with additional IoT devices, such as the FitBit, Apple Watch, and Oura Ring for more accurately measuring sleep and delivering sleep improvement enhancements, such as smart light bulbs to entrain and strengthen circadian rhythms, and Amazon's Alexa to deliver relaxation interventions and reminders to address compliance. The developed software will include a sleep diary with all relevant sleep statistics viewable by a trained therapist in the gold standard treatment for insomnia, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi). Displaying this data to the clinician can be used to deliver more personalized interventions and increase compliance with the treatment. We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial on 65+ aged healthy individuals in an independent living facility that have symptoms for insomnia and compare our enhanced type of CBTi integrated with new IoT technology to typical CBTi and a passive control of sleep hygiene therapy. We hypothesize that our intervention is just as effective as the gold standard treatment for insomnia of CBTi as measured by sleep efficiency on a sleep diary (primary outcome). The system may also have the additional benefit of improving next day cognitive performance (secondary outcome), a meaningful indicator of cognitive decline and AD risk. Exploratory analyses further test the effects of the intervention on a neurodegeneration biomarker panel and additional cognitive performance measures. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop an improved multi-modal and non-pharmacological intervention to reduce conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and reduce Alzheimer's Disease (AD) risk in a 65+ population with symptoms of insomnia. We improve sleep, a known risk factor for cognitive decline, AD, and neurodegeneration biomarkers by combining acoustic deep sleep stimulation with Internet of Things device to augment the sleep environment and a system for improving cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) that leverages big-data. We will run a randomized clinical trial on 100 people over an 8- week period to validate this technology. The primary outcome is sleep efficiency measured on a sleep diary, the typical measure of insomnia in clinical settings.

"Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Individual sleep disorders and characteristics are known to be associated with adverse health outcomes. However, few studies consider sleep in a multivariate context. Therefore, we propose a paradigmatic shift in sleep research towards sleep health. Conducting research through a sleep health lens can change health practice by clarifying which sleep characteristics are most important to treat, enhancing screening efforts, and facilitating the generalization of findings to all individuals, not just those with specific sleep disorders or complaints. Before achieving these long-term goals, however, the crucial first steps in the study of sleep health are to determine which sleep profiles predict health outcomes (Aim 1), and develop predictive algorithms that can identify individuals at risk of adverse health outcomes based on their sleep and other risk factors (Aim 2). These aims can only be achieved with an awareness of the statistical challenges related to the inherent multidimensionality of sleep health (e.g. multiple domains of sleep, multiple characteristics to represent each domain, multiple data sources, etc.). This multidimensionality generates substantial methodological barriers regarding variable and model selection and threatens researchers' abilities to develop transparent and reproducible models. In this R01, investigators will apply rigorous, sophisticated statistical methods to a large aggregated sample of adults aged >60 with self-report and polysomnographic characterization and over 10 years of longitudinal follow-up from three parent studies: Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Sleep Study (MrOS), Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). In Aim 1, investigators will determine which multidimensional sleep profiles predict time to mortality in older adults using Cox-proportional hazards models, tree-structured survival analysis, and clustering. In Aim 2, investigators will develop powerful machine learning algorithms that incorporate sleep and other risk factors to identify which older adults have the greatest risk for early mortality. Within each aim, the impact of sex and race will be rigorously investigated, and models will be internally validated in independent samples to ensure reproducibility. The Secondary Aim is to investigate generalizability to studies with different demographic profiles and sleep protocols (Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, Honolulu Asia Aging Study of Sleep America) and different data types (sleep diary, actigraphy). All models will be developed in the context of other important known risk factors, including but not limited to age, gender, race, sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, smoking, and BMI. Findings from Aim 1 will jumpstart subsequent mechanistic research focused on sleep-related causal factors of mortality, leading to identification of targeted treatments for sleep problems that could reduce risk of mortality and morbidity. Findings from Aim 2 will provide important preliminary evidence for enhanced screening tools that can more accurately identify which individuals are at risk for adverse health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project initiates a paradigmatic research shift by studying multivariate sleep health in older adults.

"Genetic Analysis of Sleep Disorders in Zebrafish Greater thari 10% of hurhahs suffer chronic sleep disorders, hut the genetic m¿:hanisims that regulate sleep are largely unknown. The identification of defective Hypocretin/Orexin i[Hcrt) signaling as a cause of narcolepsy provided ia genetic enUry point into sleepresearch.but an effective treatment for this disorder has not yet been found. Moreover, only a sniall fraction of sleep disorders are associated with narcolepsy, indicating that additional genes that control sleep and wakefulness remain to be identified. The objective of this proposal is to use zebrafish as a simpile and cost-effective vertebrate rnodel system to study the genetics of Hcrt Jsighaling andsleep. Zebrafish are an excellent model for these studies because they are amenable to high-throughput genetic screens and, unlike invertebra:tes, have a Hcrt ortholog and the basic brain stl-iictures that regulate sleepin mammals. I have shown that Hcrt overexpression causes an insomhia-like phenotype in zebrafish larvae. In Specific Aim 1,1 will use pharmacological agents to determine the genetic and neurologic mechanisms by which Hcrt dverexpress;ion induces this phenotype^ These experiments vvill use reagents identified in a small molecule screen that I performed during the K99 phase of this grant. The results of these experiments will improve understanding Of Hcrt function and may provide cIue:S to the basis of chronic insomnia. In Specific Aim 2,1 will study secreted peptides that caused specific sleep phenotypes in the genetic overexpression screen that I performed during the K99 phase of this grant. These experiments vyill confirm results frorh the screen and characterize potentially novel genetic mechanisms that regulate sleep.   My long-term career goalis to elucidate: the genetic and neurologic mechanisms that regulate sleep/wake states,  with the hope that this knowledge will lead to treatments for sleep disorders. Caltech is an excellent environnient to pursue this goal since there are several labs performing outstanding research in the genetics of behavior arid behavioral neuroscience, as well as labs studying the regulation of sleep in other model systems. Relevance: Over 10% of humans suffer from sleep disorders, yet little is known about the causes of sleep disorders or how sleep is regulated. This prpposal will use zebrafish as a modiel system to study how sleep is regulated by studying a gene whose loss causes the human sleep disorder narcolepsy.

"Sleep Health Profiles in Middle-aged Workers in Relation to Cardiovascular and Cognitive Health Middle-aged workers are vulnerable to having poor sleep, which is a public concern as it may lead to decreased productivity at work and increased risks of health problems over time. Most studies have associated one aspect of sleep (often focusing on sleep duration) with work or health-related variables, lacking a comprehensive understanding of how the combinations of multiple dimensions of sleep within individuals are associated with work-related stress and health outcomes. For example, a combination of sufficient sleep duration, regular sleep/wake, efficient sleep, and no insomnia symptom may be more predictive of concurrent and later cardiovascular and cognitive health than sleep duration alone. We propose to use multidimensional sleep health profiles that measure “which” and “how many” sleep problems co-occur within individuals. Harmonizing two independent project data sets from the Midlife in the United States Study (MIDUS) and Work, Family & Health Study (WFHS), the proposed study aims at examining the relationships between work-to-nonwork conflict (work stress carried over to and interfering with family and personal activities including sleep), sleep health profiles, and cardiovascular and cognitive health. Aim 1 will identify sleep health profiles in middle-aged workers and examine the associations of work-to-nonwork conflict with the sleep health profiles. Using extensive measures of self- reported and actigraphy-measured sleep, we will identify a priori-defined and empirically-derived sleep health profiles in diverse forms and will evaluate reproducibility of sleep health profiles across MIDUS and WFHS samples. Aim 2 will examine the associations of the sleep health profiles with cardiovascular health outcomes. Taking advantage of two cohorts in MIDUS that were sampled before and after the U.S. Great Recession period (2007-2009), we will also examine the health impacts of a macro- level stressor, whether those who were exposed to the economic recession exhibit a stronger link between sleep health profiles and cardiovascular outcomes than a propensity-matched sample who were not exposed to the recession but otherwise equal on all observables. Aim 3 will further examine the associations of the sleep health profiles with cognitive outcomes, leveraging MIDUS longitudinal cognitive data that include objectively measured episodic memory and executive functioning. We will also explore (1) whether sleep health profiles mediate the relationships between work-related stress (work-to-nonwork conflict) and cardiovascular and cognitive health, (2) potential moderation by sex and race, and (3) daily characteristics that predict optimal sleep health nights (using machine-learning). The proposed sleep health profiles can be broadly used to improve prediction accuracy in health screening tools. Focusing on middle-aged workers will contribute to decreasing health disparities in the workforce and promoting work productivity and healthy aging. Findings will inform the development of sleep-focused interventions to improve sleep and health among middle-aged workers who are in greater need. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of sleep health profiles among U.S. middle-aged workers is expected to increase understanding of how the combinations of multiple sleep characteristics relate to work-related stress and cardiovascular and cognitive health. The identified sleep health profile can be broadly used to improve prediction accuracy in health screening tools and can provide a basis for developing population-level sleep health interventions.

"NOVEL SYSTEMS TO EVALUATE SLEEP APNEA AND VIGILANCE The proposed research demonstrates the feasibility for two innovative evaluation procedures for diagnostic screening and treatment outcome assessment for sleep apnea (SA). The Alertness for diagnostic screening and treatment outcome assessment for sleep apnea (SA). The Alertness Profiler (AP) combines an easy-to-apply electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring system and PC-based vigilance, attention and memory tests in a 90-minute protocol designed to quantify levels of daytime drowsiness and their effects on performance. The AP will be evaluated with 20 SA patients and 20 health subjects and referenced to a previously collected normative database. The Apnea Risk Evaluation System (ARES) is an integrated system including: a physiological data acquisition device for monitoring SpO2, pulse, snoring and head position, easily self-applied and comfortably worn overnight to screen for SA; software to identify respiratory events and artifacts; a validated questionnaire to assess risk factors commonly associated with SA; and an expert system to classify individuals into five risk levels for SA. During Phase I, the prototype ARES device will be designed and tested on five health subjects. Software development will begin using data from 30 SA patients. The AP and the ARES can be used together or independently to offer accurate, inexpensive and easy to administer tests for the assessment and monitoring of SA. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: An estimated 20 million people in the U.S. suffer from sleep apnea (SA), the majority undiagnosed. The Alertness Profiler and the Apnea Risk Evaluation System (ARES) offer accurate, inexpensive and easily administered procedures for the assessment and monitoring of SA and the measurement of daytime drowsiness. Both products will be marketed to industry, healthcare and epidemiologists. The ARES will also be sold directly to consumers.

"Mechanisms of sleep deficiency and effects on brain injury and neurocognitive functions among older blacks Project Summary Translational studies showing a mechanistic interplay between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis and sleep/circadian disruption has renewed interest in the maxim ‘sleep is of the brain, by the brain, and for the brain’. Relative to adults sleeping well, those exhibiting sleep deficiency (SD), defined as poor sleep, sleep apnea, and/or circadian misalignment, have greater AD risk (OR=1.55), cognitive decline (OR=1.68), or preclinical AD (OR=3.78). Since SD is observed early in the course of AD, it constitutes a prime target for prevention. Notwithstanding successes in delineating the mechanisms and functions of sleep, a critical gap remains in elucidating factors undergirding sleep disparities among blacks, marked by a greater AD risk burden. Blacks also shoulder a greater sleep burden as evidenced by a higher prevalence of the main SD indices, which are linked to increased vascular risks, inflammation, brain injury, and cognitive impairment. The multi-disciplinary team will utilize innovative dynamic and geospatial modeling in a multi-level framework to delineate the psychosocial and environmental determinants of SD and its putative effects on the brain health of older blacks. We will leverage the success of the NYU Sleep Disparity Workgroup, comprising investigators with expertise in aging research, translational sleep and circadian sciences, brain health, health disparities, and geospatial and multi-level dynamic modeling. We will leverage the social capital and assets of our Community Steering Committee to enroll 504 blacks (60-75 years) from traditional and non-traditional venues to capture study endpoints. We will investigative the following aims: 1) To ascertain the psychosocial (social/emotional support, mood, discrimination, attitudes) and environmental (household [density, noise, air quality, light, and temperature], socioeconomic position, social capital, neighborhood [built environment]) factors that are associated with SD; 2) To assess effects of SD on markers of brain injury (Hcy, NFL, GFAP, Tau & Amyloid-β peptides) and on neurocognitive functions (attention, language, memory, and executive function using the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite and Trail Making Test). The contributions of vascular risk (obesity, BP, lipid, and glucose/HbA1C) and inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) will be weighted; 3) To characterize blacks who are at increased risk of SD using Bayesian machine-learning modeling and forecast through Agent-Based modeling which amalgamation of psychosocial and environmental changes will lead to a reduced SD burden and related brain health profile among older blacks over time (5, 10, & 20 yrs.). The investigative team will use novel home-based digital recorders, innovative brain health biomarkers, geospatial analytics and dynamic systems modeling to describe the mechanisms of SD and delineate their potential role in explaining observed disparities in markers of brain health of older blacks. Project Narrative Despite the high risk for sleep-related morbidity, there is a paucity of data on sleep-disrupting psychosocial and environmental stressors associated with sleep deficiency (poor sleep, sleep apnea, and/or circadian misalignment) among older blacks. Our multi-disciplinary team will use novel mHealth devices recording sleep/activity cycles, light, noise, air quality, temperature, and greenspace exposure; novel brain biomarkers; and geospatial analytics to assess effects on sleep deficiency and delineate their role in explaining disparities in the brain and cognitive health of older blacks.",Mechanisms of sleep deficiency and effects on brain injury and neurocognitive functions among older blacks,9976783,R01AG067523,"['Activity Cycles', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Air', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Aphorisms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attitude', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Circadian desynchrony', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Green space', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Leadership', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shoulder', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Strategic Planning', 'TNF gene', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Trail Making Test', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'age related', 'base', 'brain health', 'built environment', 'career', 'circadian', 'cognitive function', 'density', 'digital', 'disparity reduction', 'dynamic system', 'environmental change', 'environmental stressor', 'ethnic minority population', 'executive function', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'mHealth', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'pre-clinical', 'psychosocial', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'social capital', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'translational study', 'vascular contributions']",NIA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,833876,0.3120314286484702
"In-Home Sleep Apnea Risk Evaluation System Sleep Apnea (SA) is the most common disorder observed in the practice of sleep medicine and is responsible for more mortality and morbidity than any other sleep disorder. Although more than 4% of the population is estimated to suffer from SA, the majority are undiagnosed and untreated. This proposal furthers the development of the Apnea Risk Evaluation System (ARES), an integrated system that includes: a) an acquisition device that can be easily self-applied to the forehead and comfortably worn throughout the night to collect high-quality physiological data to screen for SA (SpO2, pulse, snoring and head position), b) software designed to identify respiratory events and movement artifacts, c) a questionnaire to assess risk factors commonly associated with SA, and d) expert system logic to classify an individual's level of risk for SA. The proposed study is a continuation of a previous Phase I ARES study. These goals include: furthering the validation and testing of the ARES Profile Analysis and completing design and. calibration of the ARES Device in preparation for testing on human subjection. The ARES is designed to be an inexpensive, self- applied, in-home method for assessment of risk for SA. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Sleep Apnea is a serious, prevalent, under-diagnosed, but treatable disorder, creating a significant market demand for accurate, inexpensive and easy-to-administer assessment methods.

"Sleep metrics from machine learning for Alzheimer's disease diagnostics PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is responsive to NIH solicitation PA-17-089 for projects involving secondary analysis of pre-existing geriatric datasets. While presently there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, existing literature indicates that early diagnosis in the preclinical stage, i.e., before the onset of clinical symptoms, will be key to treatments. There is a pressing need for noninvasive predictors of cognitive decline that can enable early identification of individuals at Alzheimer’s disease risk. A mounting body of scientific evidence suggests that sleep disturbances (including microarchitectural disruptions to non-rapid-eye-motion sleep and decline in sleep quality) might be the earliest observable symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. On-the-go sleep and activity monitoring could address the need for noninvasive indicators of cognitive decline in subjects who are in the (asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic) preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we will build on preliminary results that reveal a set of sleep features derived from polysomnography (PSG) that are predictive of cognitive performance. We are proposing to perform secondary analysis of sleep and cognition data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort using state-of-the-art deep learning tools to enable sleep-based prediction of cognitive impairment for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease. While PSG is the gold standard for sleep measurement, it is not well- suited for routine, day-to-day use. In comparison, wrist-based measurements (e.g. actigraphy, heart rate, ECG, and pulse oximetry) obtained from wearable devices allow “on-the-go” sleep monitoring. The combination of these on-the-go measures with the latest artificial intelligence tools is a feasible route to early Alzheimer’s diagnostics. We will use attention-guided long short-term memory autoencoders to identify overt and latent characteristics of the raw time-series datasets, which will allow us to more effectively mine the rich MESA data resource. Our deep learning framework will also take into account sociodemographic variables, indicators of health status, and medications. To ensure scientific rigor, secondary validation of the MESA-trained deep learning models will be performed on PSG and actigraphy data from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, which is a longitudinal study designed to further our understanding of what differentiates normal aging from preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. To address any concern about the “black-box” nature of deep learning models, we will compare the learned feature set with sleep microarchitectural features previously computed using classical statistical techniques. Previous data suggests that a subject’s apolipoprotein ε4 (ApoE4) allele carrier status influences the degree to which their sleep patterns impact their cognitive abilities. We will verify this by incorporating ApoE4 status as an additional input to the deep learning model. Literature shows that over 60% of patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease have at least one clinical sleep disorder. The on-the-go prediction paradigm using noninvasive sleep measurements to be validated in this project will have a significant impact on early Alzheimer’s diagnostics and facilitate ongoing clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sleep disturbances are a common feature of dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease before the onset of symptoms would be critically important for disease management and therapeutics. In this R21 Exploratory Analyses Grant, we propose to develop and validate state-of-the-art deep learning tools to discover novel sleep-based predictors for Alzheimer’s disease through secondary analysis of sleep, activity, and cognitive data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort of human subjects.",Sleep metrics from machine learning for Alzheimer's disease diagnostics,10042952,R21AG068890,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Apolipoproteins', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Heart Rate', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Polysomnography', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Research Design', 'Route', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'aging brain', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'carrier status', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'long short term memory', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sleep pattern', 'sleep quality', 'sociodemographic variables', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R21,2020,256922,0.20796352785879343
"Phylogeny of Sleep DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): About 70 million Americans suffer from a sleep problem; among them, nearly 60 percent have a chronic sleep disorder. Sleep disorders account for approximately $16 Billion of the annual US health care bill, yet basic questions about the functions and evolution of sleep remain unanswered and understudied. The purpose of this proposal is to investigate the distinct evolutionary histories and physiological functions of the two major mammalian sleep states REM (rapid eye movement or active sleep) and NREM (non-REM or quiet sleep) using state of the art analytic procedures for assessment of phylogenetic change. Such an investigation would clarify the role of each of the sleep states in the restorative capacities of sleep and would illuminate the ways in which breakdowns in the separate functions of each sleep state could lead to clinical disorders of sleep. Our approach is to use phylogeny-based comparative analysis to examine how, and in association with which other traits, REM and NREM evolved. Research during the past two decades has produced major advances in understanding sleep within particular species. Simultaneously, molecular advances have made it possible to generate phylogenetic trees, while new analytical methods provide the tools to examine macroevolutionary change on these trees. Thus, comparative methodology has entered a new ""Golden Age"" - but these methods have yet to be applied to questions concerning the evolution of distinctive sleep state functions. Our specific aims are to 1) Develop a Web-accessible comparative database on mammalian sleep patterns. Exhaustive literature searches have shown that quality data on sleep quotas is now available for approximately 150 species. We present analyses in this re-submittal that show that data on sleep quotas that were obtained over the past few decades in the laboratory are generally reliable and valid indices of sleep processes as they occur in the wild. Investigators who collected these data made strenuous efforts when recording sleep values to approximate natural conditions for the animals under study. Our other aims involve analyses of the data set constructed under Aim 1. These aims include 2) Investigate allometric trends, quantify phylogenetic signal and identify confounding variables. 3) Test a priori hypotheses for the evolution of and functions of active/REM versus quiet non-REM Sleep: 4) Develop a cost-benefit model of sleep states: Development of a cost-benefit model of sleep will allow us to further explore independent functions of REM/NREM and to derive clinical implications of perturbations in sleep durations of the two sleep states that typically occur in major human sleep disorders. n/a",Phylogeny of Sleep,7209005,R01MH070415,"['Accidents', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Arts', 'Basal metabolic rate', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Sciences', 'Body Size', 'Body Temperature', 'Brain', 'Budgets', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Condition', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evolution', 'Excessive Daytime Sleepiness', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modems', 'Molecular', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Neurobiology', 'Occupations', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Parasitic infection', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Phylogeny', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predatory Behavior', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Purpose', 'REM Sleep', 'Race', 'Rate', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain size', 'cluster computing', 'comparative', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'fitness', 'grasp', 'indexing', 'life history', 'mathematical model', 'men', 'neglect', 'non rapid eye movement', 'parasitism', 'programs', 'rapid eye movement', 'research study', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trait', 'trend', 'vehicular accident', 'web-accessible']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2007,320183,0.4927653959305546

"Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep Project Summary Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in the aging population and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, including cerebrovascular injury. Repetitive exposure to acute CV response, such as sympathetic surge and blood pressure (BP) rise following obstructive respiratory events, is an important mediating mechanism linking OSA to CV disease and cerebrovascular injury. However, such acute CV responses are not effectively captured by conventional polysomnography metrics, such as the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) commonly used in OSA evaluation. This results in imprecise classification of patients in terms of their CV risk and may be responsible for inconsistent results in epidemiologic and clinical studies. More importantly, the uncertainty of the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in reducing the CV risk poses a significant challenge in therapeutic decision-making in older individuals. Therefore, the identification of additional phenotypic markers that better quantify the unfavorable CV effects of OSA and provide improved prediction of CV outcomes is crucial to improving risk stratification and clinical therapeutic decision-making. Herein, we propose to study novel physiologic measurements that can readily be retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether PPG features are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CV disease, and cerebrovascular injury. We will extract PPG features from polysomnography obtained in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study and examine whether PPG features are associated with CV outcomes, including left ventricular mass, aortic stiffness, and incident cardiovascular events, as well as markers of cerebrovascular injury, including brain structural abnormalities by MRI and cognitive impairment by Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument in the older men and women. We will compare the association of PPG features with these outcomes with that of conventional OSA assessment metrics (such as apnea hypopnea index). The main PPG feature of interest is slope transit time. To assess the utility of the various PPG features for use in estimating and classifying outcomes, we will use novel machine learning methods, such as are based on the GNOSIS (Generalized Networks for the Optimal Synthesis of Information Systems) information-theory-based modeling tool. Subsequently, we will determine how PPG features predict BP treatment response to CPAP and O2 therapy using data from the HeartBEAT randomized controlled trial. This study attempts to identify novel PSG metrics that are cardiovascular-centric and to assess their clinical utility in the older adults. The findings of the study will provide a basis for further development of a simpler method by which to assess and monitor OSA. Considering the high prevalence of OSA in older populations, coupled with its impact on adverse health outcomes, the proposal has significant public health implications. Project Narrative Currently used conventional metrics for sleep apnea assessment has many limitations including insufficient consideration of acute cardiovascular response to sleep apnea event. We propose to study a novel physiologic measurements that can be readily retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether they are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CVD and neurocognitive outcomes. We will use data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study to evaluate PPG features in their associations with outcomes and examine whether these features help identify people who respond better to CPAP therapy in terms of blood pressure in the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) randomized controlled trial data.",Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep,10107688,R21AG070576,"['Acute', 'Apnea', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Heart', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Information Theory', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Left Ventricular Mass', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Older Population', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Polysomnography', 'Public Health', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'aging population', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'older men', 'older women', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predicting response', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2020,256550,0.16698233571174556
"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation.

"Novel Real-Time Algorithms:Quantifying Wake-Sleep States The overall goal of this project is to develop and clinically validate a novel class of computerized EEG-based algorithms and sophisticated signal processing methods designed for high temporal resolution characterization of the wake-sleep transition and fluctuations within sleep stages. In addition to their capability of profiling wakefulness and various sleep stages as a continuous process, these algorithms will be developed in a format such that they can be eventually implemented for real-time detection of wake-to sleep transitions. The new approach of this proposal is based on an innovative interaction of classically independent signal processing methods for quantifying EEG, including traditional Short-Term Fourier Transform, Recursive Auto-regressive Parameter Estimation, and Wavelet analysis. This new approach takes advantage of each method's relative strength and ""fuses"" the information obtained from each technique to provide a means of quantifying the entire wake-sleep transition with high temporal resolution (e.g., early detection of sleep onset) while being robust to factors that normally degrade EEG processing. The developed algorithms will be validated with an extensive set of clinical data including nocturnal polysomnography, and day-time tests of Sleepiness, MSLT (Multiple Sleep Latency Test) and MWT (Maintenance of Wakefulness Test). The dynamic events detected by these algorithms (e.g., micro-arousals and micro-sleeps) will be evaluated against standard R&K scoring of the same EEG data. Furthermore, the profile and characteristics of the events detected in PSG will be correlated with the daytime objective and subjective tests of sleepiness. n/a",Novel Real-Time Algorithms:Quantifying Wake-Sleep States,6838292,R43HL078442,"['arousal', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'electroencephalography', 'human subject', 'mathematics', 'polysomnography', 'sleep', 'wakefulness']",NHLBI,"CLEVELAND MEDICAL DEVICES, INC.",R43,2004,176785,0.32465223498185114
"Instrument to Co-register EEG and NIRS for Accurate Sleep Sorting DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     PROJECT SUMMARY Sleep disorders are highly prevalent and are associated with substantial adverse consequences including motor vehicle and other accidents, impaired cognition, impaired immune function, altered mood, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. The gold standard test for assessing the physiology of sleep is the polysomnogram suffers from a number of well-recognized limitations. These limitations decrease the capacity of sleep researchers to make advances in understanding sleep and diminish the capacity of clinicians to detect and treat patients suffering from sleep disorders. (PSG). Currently employed PSG technology Our long-term goal is to address the shortcomings of current PSG methodology by developing a low cost, low for automated assessment of sleep physiology. We hypothesize that this would be possible by expanding the types of brain assessments carried out to include near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) where recent evidence suggests that the low frequency hemodynamic oscillation reflect sleep stage-related changes in brain function. NIRS also simultaneously provides cerebral oxygen saturation, heart rate and breathing rate estimates. In this application, we propose to design, build, and test power, low noise, ultra-miniaturized, wireless system a proof-of-principle prototype system combining diffuse optical spectroscopic, electrophysiological, and inertial . This system will have the form factor of an adhesive bandage which will disturb and limit subjects to a far lesser degree than traditional PSG systems. We will use supervised machine learning-based methods to explore NIRS features specific to sleep stages and clinically relevant events. Other innovations include recording inertial signals and incorporating adaptive signal processing in order to remove artifacts and improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR), and using commercial-off-the-shelf proximity sensor circuitry to support the NIRS front-end. measurement capabilities If successful, this project will lead to improved capacity to carry out sleep research and to detect and treat sleep disorders. The proposed methodology would test whether novel clinically relevant NIRS parameters can be explored enabling further understanding of sleep physiology. The miniaturization, low cost, and low power consumption of our new NIRS-based wireless system would pave the way for rapid adoption and deployment of these bandages for home-use in real-world settings. Given the high prevalence and substantial impairments associated with sleep disorders, this project has the potential to have a major positive impact on public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative A review carried out by the Institute of Medicine concluded that 50-70 million people in the United States suffer from a chronic disorder of sleep and wakefulness which diminishes their ability to function, adversely impacts their health, and decreases longevity. Current systems for objectively monitoring sleep physiology and diagnosing sleep disorders suffer from a number of widely-recognized shortcomings that limit the capacity of researchers to make advances in understanding sleep and sleep disorders and diminish the capacity of clinicians to detect and treat patients suffering from these conditions. Our long term goal is to develop a low cost, low power, low noise, ultra-miniaturized, wireless system for automated assessment of sleep physiology which addresses these shortcomings. The specific objective of this proposal is to investigate the capability of a miniaturized, wireless near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) system to achieve this.

In this application, we propose to design, build, and test power, low noise, ultra-miniaturized, wireless system a proof-of-principle prototype system combining diffuse optical spectroscopic, electrophysiological, and inertial . This system will have the form factor of an adhesive bandage which will disturb and limit subjects to a far lesser degree than traditional PSG systems. We will use supervised machine learning-based methods to explore NIRS features specific to sleep stages and clinically relevant events. Other innovations include recording inertial signals and incorporating adaptive signal processing in order to remove artifacts and improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR), and using commercial-off-the-shelf proximity sensor circuitry to support the NIRS front-end. measurement capabilities If successful, this project will lead to improved capacity to carry out sleep research and to detect and treat sleep disorders. The proposed methodology would test whether novel clinically relevant NIRS parameters can be explored enabling further understanding of sleep physiology. The miniaturization, low cost, and low power consumption of our new NIRS-based wireless system would pave the way for rapid adoption and deployment of these bandages for home-use in real-world settings. Given the high prevalence and substantial impairments associated with sleep disorders, this project has the potential to have a major positive impact on public health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative A review carried out by the Institute of Medicine concluded that 50-70 million people in the United States suffer from a chronic disorder of sleep and wakefulness which diminishes their ability to function, adversely impacts their health, and decreases longevity. Current systems for objectively monitoring sleep physiology and diagnosing sleep disorders suffer from a number of widely-recognized shortcomings that limit the capacity of researchers to make advances in understanding sleep and sleep disorders and diminish the capacity of clinicians to detect and treat patients suffering from these conditions. Our long term goal is to develop a low cost, low power, low noise, ultra-miniaturized, wireless system for automated assessment of sleep physiology which addresses these shortcomings. The specific objective of this proposal is to investigate the capability of a miniaturized, wireless near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) system to achieve this. As such, the proposed project has the potential to improve the lives of the millions of people suffering from sleep disorders.            ",Instrument to Co-register EEG and NIRS for Accurate Sleep Sorting,8771722,R21NS085818,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adhesives', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Apnea', 'Bandage', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Breathing', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lithium', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Movement', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Noise', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plethysmography', 'Polymers', 'Polysomnography', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleeplessness', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Wakefulness', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'immune function', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'meetings', 'miniaturize', 'mortality', 'novel', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'sleep onset']",NINDS,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R21,2014,265759,0.44704697397034365
"CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Intellectual Merit: There is compelling evidence that the distinct stages of sleep play an essential role in the long-term consolidation of memories (Marshall & Born 2007). Specifically, slow-wave sleep (SWS), which is hallmarked by slow oscillatory activity (< 1 Hz) in the human electro-encephalogram (EEG), has been implicated in memory consolidation. We demonstrated that weak electric currents (<1mA, <1Hz and DC) applied to the scalp during SWS modulate these endogenous EEG rhythms and can improve human memory performance (Marshall 2006a). Moreover, application of the same weak currents during learning modulates ongoing EEG rhythms that are typical for the awake state in humans and boosts immediate performance in some learning tasks (Kirov 2009). Yet, despite these remarkable phenomenological findings, the question of how weak currents can modulate brain oscillations and induce plastic changes in brain function remains fundamentally unaddressed. Here we propose to quantitatively address this question through the development of computational models that are tightly constrained by specialized brain-slice experiments and validated through targeted human subject experiments. A central question is: how can weak electric currents, that appear insufficient to modulate excitability or plasticity in quiescent neurons, exert such a powerful effect on oscillations and learning? Our central hypothesis is that weak currents couple into ongoing slow oscillatory activity that then boost their modulatory effect on synaptic plasticity. Preliminary data from our group and others already provides strong evidence for modulation of endogenous rhythmic network activity by applied currents - at intensities considered too weak to affect single neuron function. Concurrently, we and other groups have investigated links between slow wave activity and memory consolidation, including by application of weak currents in human. But a specific connection between the effects of applied weak currents on slow-wave rhythms and plasticity has so far not been explored. Guided by computational models, the crucial empirical link between the two will be sought by probing lasting changes resulting from weak-current stimulation of an in vitro cortical preparation that exhibits SWA. Targeted human experiments will directly test if applied currents also enhance the consolidation of other SWS-mediated learning as the hypothesis would suggest, or rather, if the effect is limited to hippocampus-related learning, thus providing significant constraints to the computational models.    Broader Impacts: Weak applied currents are being explored in a number of empirical studies for their potential benefits to treat depression and neuropathic pain, to assist motor learning after stroke, or more generally, to enhance cognitive performance and to improve learning. The promise of this technique is that weak currents can be applied non-invasively with a potentially broad range of applications and minimal side effects. The enigma in this potentially transformative clinical tool, however, is that the electric field strengths generated by these currents in most studies are two orders of magnitude below what is required to activate an otherwise silent neuron. Currently, research in this area is almost entirely phenomenological and the few mechanistic explanations for the promising phenomenological observations are superficial (e.g. describing all brain function as a ""sliding scale of excitability"") and do not address plasticity - as such, there is no rational basis for improving and targeting stimulation protocols. This work is the first attempt at establishing the mechanistic link between applied currents on endogenous rhythms and the associated SWS-related learning enhancements. Evidently, such an analysis will address basic science questions about the link between endogenous SWS and learning, add to the set of experimental tools which can be used to study cognition, and, shed light on the functional and causal role of the ubiquitous endogenous rhythms generated by the brain.    Consistent with present call for US/German Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience this project will combined the expertise of international researchers in the areas of: (1) effects of noninvasive electrical stimulation on nervous tissue (Bikson, US), EEG signal analysis and computational network models (Parra, US), human sleep and learning with applied currents (Marshall, Germany), and dynamical systems and machine learning (Claussen/Martinetz, Germany; Parra, US).           n/a",CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep,8662794,R01MH092926,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Chemosensitization', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Models', 'Frequencies', 'German population', 'Germany', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'International', 'Ion Channel', 'Kale - dietary', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Marshal', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Neocortex', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual learning', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Slice', 'Slide', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'density', 'electric field', 'human subject', 'imprint', 'improved', 'memory trace reactivation', 'motor learning', 'neocortical', 'painful neuropathy', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIMH,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R01,2014,124361,0.17983574513281786

"Prediction of Physiological Events in People with Sleep Disordered Breathing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) refers to a spectrum of disorders characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns or levels of ventilation during sleep. The most common is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). People with OSA experience repetitive apnea (cessation of breathing) and hypopnea (marked decrease in tidal volume) during sleep in association with airway compromise and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). An arousal, or brief, often unnoticed, disruption of sleep is commonly associated with apnea. People with OSA also exhibit cognitive dysfunction, including impairment to memory, attention, and executive function. OSA- associated EDS and cognitive dysfunction are thought to significantly contribute to automobile accidents and workplace injuries. The first aim of this research is to predict the onset of nocturnal apnea, hypopnea, and arousal. Our proposal to accomplish this aim represents an entirely new approach to improving the effectiveness and tolerability of SBD therapy. The most common therapy is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which is difficult for many patients to tolerate. Existing auto-adjusting PAP may be more tolerable but relies on detection of disordered breathing events and does not appear to improve quality of life compared with conventional CPAP. Predicting these events could lead to more effective titration of PAP levels and improved outcomes. Other therapies, such as the electrical stimulation of various cranial nerves or pharyngeal muscles, could also be improved by predicting disordered breathing. The second aim is to predict the onset of unintended daytime sleep while subjects undergo maintenance of wakefulness tests, which assess one's ability to resist sleep in a soporific condition. The third aim is to predict performance lapses during driving simulations. Accomplishing aims two and three could lead to the development of warning devices for at-risk individuals. Our novel prediction algorithms track the interactions between several physiological systems and reveal the most important predictors. The fourth aim is to contrast the key predictors between OSA, acutely sleep-deprived, and control subjects, and between men and women. By doing so, we expect to gain insight into the underlying pathophysiology of SDB and EDS, and will investigate sex differences in OSA and sleep deprivation. OSA is a major public health problem whose effects on society are comparable to those of smoking. The capability to predict its adverse consequences will be an invaluable tool to improve the quality of life of people with SDB, reduce the associated costs, and improve public health          n/a",Prediction of Physiological Events in People with Sleep Disordered Breathing,8133670,F30HL097403,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Apnea', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breathing', 'Characteristics', 'Chicago', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronics', 'Environmental air flow', 'Event', 'Excessive Daytime Sleepiness', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Illinois', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Smoking', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Societies', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Titrations', 'Universities', 'Wakefulness', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'Zebra', 'adverse outcome', 'automobile accident', 'cost', 'design', 'executive function', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'men', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pharynx muscle', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'sleep onset', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,F30,2011,42919,0.36965763980475463
"Prediction of Physiological Events in People with Sleep Disordered Breathing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) refers to a spectrum of disorders characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns or levels of ventilation during sleep.

"EEG Signatures of Offline Memory Reactivation and Consolidation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): States of rest and sleep are critical for optimal human cognitive function. Even during sleep, when sensory input and conscious awareness are minimal, the brain continues to process information from the previous day. Research in animals demonstrates that patterns of neural activity first seen during waking exploration of an environment are later ""reactivated"" during quiet rest and sleep. In humans, sleep consolidates and enhances previously formed memories. In parallel with this sleep-dependent memory processing, memories of recent experiences contribute to the images, thoughts, and narratives that we commonly call ""dreams"". Thought to be a critical component of long-term memory formation, post-learning reactivation of memories in humans has not been adequately studied, and is still poorly understood. The research proposed here would provide the first EEG-based characterization of offline memory reactivation in humans, analyzing global spatial patterns of the EEG signal recorded during encoding of a virtual navigation task, and during post-training rest and sleep. In parallel, the sampling of ongoing subjective experience provides a measure of memory reactivation at the cognitive level. Using the technique of ""microstate analysis"", our preliminary findings suggest that learning- related EEG patterns reappear during subsequent sleep, and that the extent of this ""reactivation"" predicts post- sleep task improvement.

"Pre-clinic model for sleep deprivation-induced obesity and hedonic intake due to noise exposure Easy access to calories and poor sleep independently increase eating and weight gain. Sleep deprivation (SD) increases hedonic intake (eating palatable food for pleasure) and in humans environmental noise exposure causes SD, is detrimental to health and increases obesity risk. We have shown that noise (pre-recorded random city sounds) causes SD, hyperphagia and weight gain in male rats, which is novel and replicates human data. Yet this methodology must be established in female rodents as sex is a critical biological variable. The overall goal is to establish the method of SD by noise to induce obesity in female rodents, use the model to define the contribution of hedonic intake to SD-induced obesity and use these data to develop a non- invasive method to distinguish types of sleep (REM vs. non-REM). Aim 1 will use statistical learning methods and data mining to quantify REM and non-REM based on data collected from studies in this proposal (food intake, physical activity energy expenditure, EEG, EMG) and will establish SD by noise in females as a pre- clinical model for obesity due to SD. We will compare sleep disruption caused by noise exposure and the gentle handling technique; test whether sex moderates the effect of noise exposure on sleep, weight gain and food intake and whether Suvorexant (used clinically for insomnia) normalizes sleep in noise-exposed rats. Finally, data mining will be completed to address a critical need in the sleep field: to develop a high-throughput, non-invasive technique to distinguish REM vs. non-REM in rats. In humans, SD increases hedonic intake, which promotes obesity. Taste preference is highly variable and may modulate hedonic intake caused by SD. We show clear individual taste preferences for snacks using a cafeteria (CAF) diet protocol (i.e. rotating selection of palatable human snacks plus rodent chow ad lib). We also show SD by noise increases chocolate intake in sated rats with low initial preference for chocolate and maintains intake in rats with high preference. Thus, SD by noise may increase intake of palatable foods that would normally be avoided during adequate sleep. Aim 2 will test if the effects of SD by noise on hedonic intake and obesity are dependent upon sex and individual taste preferences in rats. We will test whether SD increases binge chocolate intake and intake of CAF diet snacks. The scientific premise is: SD in increases hedonic intake and promotes obesity in humans; environmental noise promotes SD in humans; and our pre-clinical model mirrors the human response to SD. We hypothesize that like male rats, SD due to noise will cause obesity in females and increase hedonic intake despite individual preference to in turn worsen obesity. The innovation lies in establishing a simple method of SD that replicates human SD-induced obesity; developing a non-surgical method to measure sleep types; and identifying how individual preferences affects hedonic intake and obesity caused by SD. Its significance lies in establishing a translational model of SD independent of sex to identify mechanisms underlying reward behavior and obesity propensity due to SD, with the ultimate goal of developing novel anti-obesity therapies. The goal of these studies is to establish our method of sleep deprivation by environmental noise to induce obesity, and use this model to define the contribution of hedonic intake to obesity due to sleep deprivation in humans. Studies will employ a novel method of partial sleep deprivation by noise, which mimics weight gain in sleep deprived humans. We propose to establish sleep deprivation by noise in females rats, as we have shown in males, as a pre-clinical model for obesity due to sleep deprivation, develop a non-invasive method to distinguish REM from non-REM sleep based on food intake, physical activity, energy expenditure, EEG and EMG data, in lieu of EEG/EMG recordings, and define the effects of sleep deprivation by noise on hedonic intake and its influence on obesity in males and female rats.

"Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system Abstract Numerous small vessels making up the central nervous system blood and lymphatic vascular networks are heterogeneous and region-specific dynamic structures, whose segments, position, shape and function can change in response to physiological and pathophysiological conditions. To date it has not been possible to integrate blood and lymphatic vascular elements and their microenvironment to achieve a holistic quantitative characterization of the combined brain and meningeal tissue-scale vascular networks, its structure and function in normal and disease states. This application proposes to develop microscopy- based high-throughput image analysis techniques for automated extraction of blood and lymphatic vascular networks enabling quantitative morphodynamic characterization of cerebrovascular microenvironment changes in two intracranial compartments – the brain and dura mater. The study will focus on new algorithms for precise region-specific microvessel registration, mosaicing, segmentation, fusion and colocalization for constructing large tissue scale spatially aligned dual blood/lymphatic vascular network structural maps in the animals of both sexes, as well as characterization of heterogeneities of microvascular networks, including blood and lymphatic vasculature, under estrogen and sleep deprivation (the conditions relevant to multiple cerebrovascular disorders) compared to physiological settings. In other words, advanced microscopy-based techniques will be used to image blood and lymphatic vessels at sub-micron resolution in dura mater and the brain, and then cutting-edge deep machine learning imaging analysis methods will be employed to segment and quantify these vessels, their geometry, vessel wall structure, functionality, and interrelationship. Detailed structural analysis of microvascular networks is essential for accurate evaluation of the distribution of physical forces, substrate delivery and tissue clearance of waste, as well as sex differences and consequences of intracranial networks remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions. This will create knowledge enabling a better understanding of the pathogenesis of vascular impairments under estrogen and sleep deprivation, identify common molecular mechanisms and the efficacy and effectiveness of different therapeutic treatments. Without the ability to construct total structural and functional blood/lymphatic vascular network maps from studies limited to individual tissue component parts, it is little wonder that translation from the molecular and cellular levels to the whole organ and system levels is deficient and hinders translational progress towards a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology associated with a range of neurological disorders.

"Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system Abstract Numerous small vessels making up the central nervous system blood and lymphatic vascular networks are heterogeneous and region-specific dynamic structures, whose segments, position, shape and function can change in response to physiological and pathophysiological conditions. To date it has not been possible to integrate blood and lymphatic vascular elements and their microenvironment to achieve a holistic quantitative characterization of the combined brain and meningeal tissue-scale vascular networks, its structure and function in normal and disease states. This application proposes to develop microscopy- based high-throughput image analysis techniques for automated extraction of blood and lymphatic vascular networks enabling quantitative morphodynamic characterization of cerebrovascular microenvironment changes in two intracranial compartments – the brain and dura mater. The study will focus on new algorithms for precise region-specific microvessel registration, mosaicing, segmentation, fusion and colocalization for constructing large tissue scale spatially aligned dual blood/lymphatic vascular network structural maps in the animals of both sexes, as well as characterization of heterogeneities of microvascular networks, including blood and lymphatic vasculature, under estrogen and sleep deprivation (the conditions relevant to multiple cerebrovascular disorders) compared to physiological settings. In other words, advanced microscopy-based techniques will be used to image blood and lymphatic vessels at sub-micron resolution in dura mater and the brain, and then cutting-edge deep machine learning imaging analysis methods will be employed to segment and quantify these vessels, their geometry, vessel wall structure, functionality, and interrelationship. Detailed structural analysis of microvascular networks is essential for accurate evaluation of the distribution of physical forces, substrate delivery and tissue clearance of waste, as well as sex differences and consequences of intracranial networks remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions. This will create knowledge enabling a better understanding of the pathogenesis of vascular impairments under estrogen and sleep deprivation, identify common molecular mechanisms and the efficacy and effectiveness of different therapeutic treatments. Without the ability to construct total structural and functional blood/lymphatic vascular network maps from studies limited to individual tissue component parts, it is little wonder that translation from the molecular and cellular levels to the whole organ and system levels is deficient and hinders translational progress towards a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology associated with a range of neurological disorders.

"Adaptive Neurostimulation to Restore Sleep in Parkinson's Disease: An Investigation of STN LFP Biomarkers In Sleep Dysregulation and Repair Project Summary Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to both motor and non-motor symptoms. While there is as yet no cure for PD, medical and surgical therapies have been developed that effectively target the motor symptoms of PD. Non-motor symptoms are far more disabling for patients, precede the onset of motor symptoms by a decade, are more insidious in onset, have been less apparent to clinicians, and are less effectively treated. Sleep dysfunction is oftentimes the most burdensome of the non-motor symptoms—both to patients and to their caregivers—is pervasive in patients with PD, and includes sleep fragmentation, insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, REM behavioral disorder, and restless leg syndrome. There are limited options for treating sleep dysfunction in PD, and the mainstay of therapy is the use of agents that mask the sleep disturbance—such as the sedative-hypnotic drugs—without addressing the underlying mechanisms. Although much attention has been devoted to PD motor symptoms, sleep dysfunction in PD has largely been ignored. Sleep is vital to homeostasis, cognition, and nervous system repair, and the dysfunctional sleep accompanying PD adversely affects both motor and non-motor symptoms, resulting in diminished quality of life, impairments in mood and behavior, and increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with PD who demonstrate significant motor fluctuations and dyskinesia are considered for subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. Although STN-DBS is routinely used to treat PD motor symptoms, several studies have reported that STN-DBS also provides benefit for sleep dysregulation through normalization of sleep architecture. Additionally, local field potentials recorded from STN DBS electrodes implanted for the treatment of PD, have led to the identification of unique spectral patterns in STN oscillatory activity that correlate with distinct sleep cycles, offering insight into sleep dysregulation. Building on this work, and in response to RFA-NS- 18-023, this proposal will leverage novel investigational DBS battery technology (RC+S Summit System; Medtronic) that allows the exploration of sleep biomarkers and prototyping of closed-loop stimulation algorithms, to test the hypothesis that STN—a highly interconnected node within the basal ganglia—contributes to the regulation and disruption of human sleep behavior and can be manipulated for therapeutic advantage. Specifically, in PD patients undergoing STN-DBS, we will determine whether STN oscillations correlate with sleep stage transitions, then construct and evaluate sensing and adaptive stimulation paradigms that allow ongoing sleep-stage identification, and induce through adaptive stimulation an increase in duration of sleep stages associated with restorative sleep. This work will lead to findings that address a currently unmet clinical need, and relevant to the mission of NINDS and the BRAIN Initiative, will evaluate the use of adaptive stimulation of the STN in PD patients for the treatment of sleep dysfunction. Project Narrative With this study, we will gain a better understanding of how the basal ganglia contribute to pathological sleep behavior in humans. This information will be used to understand better how the brain regulates sleep and how we can intervene therapeutically in sleep regulation in order to develop new therapies for sleep disorders both for patients with Parkinson’s disease and for other populations suffering from dysfunctional sleep. In addition, we will use these results to improve the accuracy of sleep dysfunction diagnoses, enabling the application of existing therapies more appropriately, and the development of novel therapies.",Adaptive Neurostimulation to Restore Sleep in Parkinson's Disease: An Investigation of STN LFP Biomarkers In Sleep Dysregulation and Repair,9960743,UH3NS113769,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Bradykinesia', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Control Groups', 'Crossover Design', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Excessive Daytime Sleepiness', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Home environment', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Maintenance', 'Masks', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Moods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'REM Sleep Behavior Disorder', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Restless Legs Syndrome', 'STN stimulation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep Disorders Therapy', 'Sleep Fragmentations', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tremor', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'artificial neural network', 'clinical research site', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'experimental group', 'hypnotic', 'implantation', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'motor symptom', 'neural stimulation', 'non-motor symptom', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'potential biomarker', 'prototype', 'repaired', 'response', 'sedative', 'side effect', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep quality', 'sleep regulation', 'specific biomarkers', 'symposium']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER,UH3,2020,1129485,0.4301080804971241
"Novel fMRI Strategy to Assess Consciousness in Brain-Injured Patients Multiple studies have shown that some patients who remain behaviorally unresponsive after severe brain damage can modulate their brain activity in response to command. A lack of response to the command- following paradigm in other patients, however, cannot be taken as evidence that consciousness is absent. There is thus an urgent need for neuroimaging tools that are able to diagnose covert consciousness in behaviorally unresponsive subjects without relying on a task. Previous neuroimaging studies of the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) have mostly utilized between-state paradigms (e.g., wakefulness vs. sleep) or report-based contrasts, which conflate differences in brain activity supporting consciousness with differences in brain activity supporting behavior or task response. To address these limitations, my sponsor (Dr. Giulio Tononi) has developed a within-state, no-report paradigm that uses serial awakenings to contrast states of consciousness versus unconsciousness during sleep, a physiological unresponsive state. Using high density electroencephalography (EEG), his group has shown that the occurrence of dreaming consciousness during sleep is associated with a reduction of delta activity (sleep slow waves) in a posterior cortical ‘hot zone’ encompassing occipital, parietal and temporal cortices. To proceed towards clinical applications, it is now essential to confirm and extend these findings using combined EEG-fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). To this effect, in an important new development, Dr. Tononi and collaborators have recently shown that it is possible to faithfully track EEG slow wave activity during sleep by means of a high-frequency (~0.17 Hz) blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) oscillation evident in fMRI. This finding provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the NCCs during sleep with high spatial resolution, avoiding potential pitfalls of EEG source modeling, and with unrestricted access to subcortical structures. Taking advantage of these new findings, in this project, I propose to combine the novel fMRI signature of sleep slow waves with a serial awakenings paradigm to locate the NCCs during sleep. Specifically, I will acquire fMRI-EEG data during ~1,080 awakenings from sleep across 40 healthy subjects and investigate the neural correlates of the presence versus absence of dreaming consciousness (Aim 1). I hypothesize that high-frequency BOLD oscillation—which tracks sleep slow-waves—will show regional decreases in specific posterior cortical areas during dreaming compared to dreamless sleep. In Aim 2, I will use univariate and multivariate modeling approaches based on high-frequency BOLD power and conventional BOLD amplitude to identify the NCCs of specific dream contents (e.g., presence of faces) and complexity. If successful, the proposed experiments will constitute an important step forward in identifying brain regions that sustain consciousness and its contents during behaviorally unresponsive states. These results can open new avenues to improve clinical care in patients with a DOC and inform the assessment of intraoperative awareness in anesthetized subjects. Due to previous methodological oversights that confounded consciousness and behavior, the neural substrates of covert consciousness in unresponsive states are poorly understood. The current project will use serial awakenings with dream reports combined with a novel functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signature of sleep slow waves to identify the neural correlates of both the presence of consciousness and its contents during sleep, a physiological unresponsive state. The goal is to help clarify a scientific controversy surrounding the neural basis of consciousness at an unprecedented spatial resolution and with an access to subcortical structures, which could ultimately to improve diagnosis through neuroimaging and clinical care for patients with disorders of consciousness.",Novel fMRI Strategy to Assess Consciousness in Brain-Injured Patients,10053237,F32NS114034,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Board Certification', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Conscious', 'Consciousness Disorders', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dreams', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Occipital lobe', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Training', 'Traumatic injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vegetative States', 'Wakefulness', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain research', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cognitive control', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'fusiform face area', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lens', 'life-sustaining therapy', 'machine learning method', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'stimulus processing', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F32,2020,67626,0.37717225936352916
"CRCNS: Unsupervised Learning of Hippocampal Sequence Dynamic in Sleep   In unit recordings from large populations of neurons, fast compressed sequential firing of neurons during rest and early sleep have been found to replay patterns first observed in active awake experience. These remarkable patterns have sparked widespread interest in the scientific community and beyond. Sequence  replay is now considered to play a critical role in the long-term stabilization and storage of mnemonically  important information. However, despite the general acknowledgement of the importance of the sequential structure, very little is known about the null background against which replay is compared. Specifically, are apparently 'non-replaying' spike patterns, as seen in late sleep, just simply noise? Because replay is typically assessed by comparison against a fixed known template, most methods can only determine whether the resemblance to the template is more than what might be expected from  random spike trains. But these methods cannot appraise whether other patterns remain in the nonsignificant events. Recently, the Diba and Kemere labs successfully collaborated to address precisely  this issue. We developed methods based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) to uncover temporal structure in spike trains of neurons in an unsupervised template-free manner. In this proposal, we aim to further improve these methods and to evaluate the hidden structure of spike trains in hippocampal  neuronal populations during sleep. In our second specific aim, we will use HMMs to determine both co-active ensemble (""contextual"") and temporal patterns (""sequential"") structure in hippocampal spike trains in both pre- and post-task sleep.

"Robust circuit computation in freely behaving animals. Project Summary/Abstract Sleep is necessary for all brain function and ultimately life. The core function by which sleep contributes to healthy cognition remains one of the great questions facing neuroscience. Recent theories point to powerful cellular rules, but these are controversial and have difficulty accounting for the effects of sleep in ethologically and developmentally diverse circumstances. We recently showed that cortical circuit dynamics are actively tuned to criticality, a computational regime that maximizes information processing. This regime is disrupted by changes in synaptic strength, such as those believed to typify waking experience. This raises the intriguing possibility that the core mechanism by which sleep benefits neural function is by restoring criticality. Our preliminary experiments support this hypothesis. The overall goal of this project is to develop a new framework for understanding the neural impact of sleep and experience at the level of network dynamics. We will continuously track 500-1000 single neurons in the brains of freely behaving animals for up to six months. We will track sleep, wake, behavior, and neural dynamics across the entire distribution of naturally occurring behavior. We will take advantage of this methodologically integrated approach to understand how circuits in the brain maintain the stable computation necessary for cognition and natural behavior on long time-scales. In Aim 1, we will test the relationship between specific classes of behavior and criticality in underlying networks. In Aim 2, we will test the impact of wake and sleep on criticality across the brain for the majority of an animal's lifetime. In Aim 3, we will use a modelling-based approach to establish the mechanisms of criticality in the intact brain. The results of this work will shed light on a long-standing gap in our knowledge of fundamental neurobiology. Given the increasingly recognized role of sleep in a vast number of brain-related disorders, an understanding of how sleep works will open the door to significant health-related progress in the future. This work directly advances the mission of the BRAIN Initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Sleep is vitally important for brain function and survival, yet its core process remains one of the most poorly understood features of life. We will apply novel methods to reveal generalizable principles about the role of sleep/experience in shaping neural circuits in the brain. In the long term, our results will enhance an understanding of the contribution of sleep to healthy cognition and the mechanisms by which disrupted sleep worsens neurodegenerative and mental health disorders.",Robust circuit computation in freely behaving animals.,10053390,R01NS118442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Darkness', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Institutes', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Process', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Wake Cycle', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive benefits', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'new technology', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'restoration', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,165708,0.3980342409595923
"Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Project Summary of Work The purpose of this administrative supplement application is to provide support for Dr. Alexandra Bey, a psychiatry resident and neuroscience researcher, to expand her opportunities to carry out translational neuroscience research during her clinical training. By conducting the project outlined in this grant, Dr. Bey will gain invaluable experience in new scientific techniques, will study a behavior and its underlying neural dynamics extremely important to neuropsychiatric illnesses, and obtain personalized mentorship that will prepare her for an independent scientific career. To her accomplished skillset in molecular genetics and mouse behavior, she will develop electrophysiology and machine learning techniques in order to advance her ability to study neuronal circuits relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders. Through supervision by Dr. Kafui Dzirasa, Dr. Bey will receive intensive mentorship on experimental design, data analysis, manuscript publication, and grant-writing in order to prepare her to run a research group and compete for independent funding. Additionally, through regular counsel from a committee of preeminent clinician-scientists, Dr. Bey will obtain guidance and support for developing as a psychiatrist-neuroscientist as well as obtain relevant clinical exposure to patients with autism. Dr. Bey and Dr. Dzirasa have developed the following research project to investigate the neural dynamics of sleep. Furthermore, sleep as a behavior is quantifiable, translational, and frequently disrupted in many psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. At present, there is very limited understanding of neural networks underlying sleep architecture. Dr. Bey’s experience with generating and characterizing different genetic mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders uniquely poise her to advance her skillset to include techniques to truly dissect neural circuits, networks, and their dynamics. Utilizing Dr. Dzirasa’s expertise in in vivo electrophysiology, our collaborator Dr. David Carlson’s expertise in machine learning, we will support Dr. Bey in her efforts to: 1) obtain multisite in vivo electrophysiological recordings in mouse models of neuropsychiatric disease during sleep and wake states, 2) utilize machine-learning algorithms to identify altered neural circuit oscillations contributing to sleep architecture, and 3) extend this work to include a clinically relevant genetic manipulation to examine gene x stress interaction on the dynamics of sleep. Dr. Bey will be a key contributor to the development of each of these experiments and through their conduct, will develop expertise in measuring and understanding neural circuit function which will allow her to advance her career in studying the neurobiological basis of autism. Project Narrative Many cortical and limbic brain regions including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus work together to coordinate emotional, social and cognitive function in health and disease. In this study, we will discover the network-level mechanisms whereby fast interactions between these brain regions become altered in major depressive disorder. The discovery and validation of this ‘depression brain-state’ may facilitate the development of new therapeutics that ameliorate depression by directly modulating altered neural dynamics in the brain.",Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder,10085101,R01MH120158,"['129 Mouse', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuscripts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Polysomnography', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Sleep Wake Cycle', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Sucrose', 'Supervision', 'Tail Suspension', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'common symptom', 'depression model', 'disabling symptom', 'emotional functioning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic manipulation', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'network architecture', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'parent grant', 'preference', 'rapid eye movement', 'relating to nervous system', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard measure', 'stress tolerance', 'translational neuroscience']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,24205,0.2621989453236462
"An automated and massively scalable platform for organismal and developmental genetics Project Summary Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper neurological development. During sleep, there is enhanced synaptic plasticity in the nervous system in addition to often extensive neural remodeling. Although we know that sleep regulation is important to neurological development, many aspects of sleep regulation are poorly understood. In particular, the mechanisms of how we compensate for missed sleep in future sleep cycles are mysterious, despite general knowledge of how circadian rhythms are established. It is likely that these mechanisms involve neuropeptide signaling in the brain. However, current tools to study the roles these peptides play in sleep homeostasis, even with the use of simple model organisms like C. elegans, are low- throughput, qualitative, and subjective. In order to study sleep-like behavior in C. elegans, there is an unmet need for a tool for continuously monitoring and perturbing long-term behavior of the worm, as well as an automated and un-biased method for quantifying behavioral data. In this proposal, we will first develop the enabling technology, and use it to identify the roles of neuropeptides in homeostasis of the nematode’s sleep- like state. In Aim I, we will engineer and validate a scalable microscopy platform for monitoring and perturbing C. elegans behavior, decreasing the cost of long-term candidate screens by ~ 100 fold. In Aim 2, we will quantify behavior of wild-type animals via an automated and bias-free quantitative analysis to establish baseline behavior and prioritize behaviors that are linked to sleep homeostasis. In Aim 3, we will use the technology developed in Aims I and 2 to quantify differences in behavior of C. elegans neuropeptide mutants using a candidate approach. Because of the strong preliminary data we have gathered so far and the experience of the sponsor’s laboratory, this proposed work is likely to identify the roles of these candidate neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis, contributing to our mechanistic understanding of sleep regulation.

"Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disrupted circadian timing has emerged as a serious health and safety issue, yet there are no objective means of easily assessing circadian timing or alignment without performing a highly controlled, multiple-day in- patient study. Altered circadian timing can cause both sleep loss and sleepiness, cause performance errors such as motor vehicle accidents, and impair memory/learning. Thus, despite the obvious need to recognize an individual's circadian phase/alignment, we cannot assess circadian timing clinically or in retrospective studies.

"The effect of insufficient sleep on cardiovascular disease disparity between blacks and whites Project Summary/Abstract Background: Blacks have higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), CVD risk markers (elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, and unhealthy glucose levels), and CVD mortality, compared to whites. Despite advances in understanding how CVD disparity is engendered and preventing CVD, blacks compared to whites are still disproportionately burdened by CVD, particularly CVD risk markers. Therefore, more novel targets that drive racial disparity in CVD risk markers must be investigated in order to reduce and eliminate CVD disparity. Evidence indicating that insufficient sleep (sleep duration ≤6hrs/24 hr. cycle), which disproportionately affects blacks, is linked to concurrent and future CVD risk may offer a potentially novel mechanism explaining CVD risk disparity between blacks and whites. However, it is unclear whether insufficient sleep directly or indirectly drives disparity in CVD risk between blacks and whites? Therefore, the purpose of the proposed K01 study is to investigate whether insufficient sleep independently explains a significant portion of racial disparity in CVD risk markers, while adjusting for the confounding effects of sleep apnea and insomnia (two sleep disorders that cause insufficient sleep). Additionally, since 55% of insufficient sleepers are obese and blacks are twice as likely to be obese compared to whites, the candidate will investigate the independent and combined effects of insufficient sleep and obesity on the disparity in CVD risk markers between blacks and whites. Research: In the proposed K01, the candidate, Dr. Azizi Seixas, will investigate: 1) whether insufficient sleep and/or obesity play an important role in the relationship between race/ethnicity and CVD risk, controlling for sleep apnea and insomnia; and 2) what sleep duration and body mass index profile is associated with lowest probability of CVD risk among blacks and whites, using advanced mathematical analytic methods and complex system simulation modeling. Training: The training plan builds upon the candidate's background and experience in conducting research in sleep disorders and cardiovascular disease (e.g. hypertension and stroke), among minority populations. During the K01, the candidate will receive training in sleep science and physiology, cardiovascular disease and advanced analytical, machine learning, and simulation modeling. He will perform secondary analyses of data from the Sleep Heart Health Study, a NHLBI-funded study. The pedagogical approach includes one-on-one mentorship, course work, mentored laboratory training (practicum), and attendance to targeted conferences and seminars, with the common goal of supporting his transition to being an independent scientist.

"The effect of insufficient sleep on cardiovascular disease disparity between blacks and whites Project Summary/Abstract Background: Blacks have higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), CVD risk markers (elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, and unhealthy glucose levels), and CVD mortality, compared to whites. Despite advances in understanding how CVD disparity is engendered and preventing CVD, blacks compared to whites are still disproportionately burdened by CVD, particularly CVD risk markers. Therefore, more novel targets that drive racial disparity in CVD risk markers must be investigated in order to reduce and eliminate CVD disparity. Evidence indicating that insufficient sleep (sleep duration ≤6hrs/24 hr. cycle), which disproportionately affects blacks, is linked to concurrent and future CVD risk may offer a potentially novel mechanism explaining CVD risk disparity between blacks and whites. However, it is unclear whether insufficient sleep directly or indirectly drives disparity in CVD risk between blacks and whites? Therefore, the purpose of the proposed K01 study is to investigate whether insufficient sleep independently explains a significant portion of racial disparity in CVD risk markers, while adjusting for the confounding effects of sleep apnea and insomnia (two sleep disorders that cause insufficient sleep). Additionally, since 55% of insufficient sleepers are obese and blacks are twice as likely to be obese compared to whites, the candidate will investigate the independent and combined effects of insufficient sleep and obesity on the disparity in CVD risk markers between blacks and whites. Research: In the proposed K01, the candidate, Dr. Azizi Seixas, will investigate: 1) whether insufficient sleep and/or obesity play an important role in the relationship between race/ethnicity and CVD risk, controlling for sleep apnea and insomnia; and 2) what sleep duration and body mass index profile is associated with lowest probability of CVD risk among blacks and whites, using advanced mathematical analytic methods and complex system simulation modeling. Training: The training plan builds upon the candidate's background and experience in conducting research in sleep disorders and cardiovascular disease (e.g. hypertension and stroke), among minority populations. During the K01, the candidate will receive training in sleep science and physiology, cardiovascular disease and advanced analytical, machine learning, and simulation modeling. He will perform secondary analyses of data from the Sleep Heart Health Study, a NHLBI-funded study.

"Mentorship in the Endocrinology of Sleep The overarching goal of this application for a K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to foster training of promising junior investigators in cutting edge patient-oriented research related to how sleep biology influences cardiometabolic health. It capitalizes on the established network and resources of the recently renewed UCLA CTSI that includes a highly successful KL2 program. Dr. Liu led a competitively- funded Endocrine and Cardiometabolic Program in Sleep Biology at the University of Sydney, and since 2012, he has led a similar interdisciplinary research program in Los Angeles supported by a 5 year NHLBI R01 “Hormonal mechanisms of sleep restriction” that is currently in its 3rd year. During his 10 years of mentoring, he has trained 16 individuals: 10 remaining in academic medicine and 2 others in industry-related patient orientated research. Three of his trainees won major US young investigator awards under his supervision. He continues to support, mentor, and publish with former trainees, often long after they left his laboratory.  Disturbed sleep causes insulin resistance, promotes poor food choices, and curtails fat loss while dieting, thereby reducing the effectiveness of standard weight loss programs. However, the cardiometabolic consequences of disturbed sleep are not well recognized by the community, and the evidential bases to justify widespread changes to community sleeping patterns for cardiometabolic health reasons are evolving. Showing the mechanisms by which sleep restriction leads to cardiometabolic ill-health, particularly in older adults according to sex, are critical steps in providing these data. Dr. Liu's goal is to mentor the next cadre of independent clinical scientists focused on placing sleep alongside diet and exercise as part of healthy lifestyle, by understanding hormonal mechanisms and consequences of disrupted, inadequate or misaligned sleep.  The work proposed in this application fulfill these goals. Aim 1 will reveal the hypothalmo-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal mechanisms that cause testosterone-cortisol imbalance when sleep is restricted in older men and women (20 in each group). In doing so, trainees will learn endocrine physiology and chronobiological study design, IRB processes, recruitment skills, and hands-on study management. Aim 2 will identify sex differences in these mechanisms, trainees will learn statistical methods and abstract/presentation/ manuscript preparation. Aim 3 requires trainees to discover new mechanisms by which sleep restriction causes insulin resistance and alters appetite or food intake. Certain inflammatory mediators, hormones, or factors related to ethnicity or age could be studied. Aim 3 fulfils broader expectations for trainees to have a second project that is faster to accomplish, more exploratory, and driven by their interests and available resources, to develop a line of research that complements and is separate from that of the mentors. Taken together, these experiments will generate new knowledge of the relationship between sleep and hormonal cardiometabolic and reproductive health, provide wide-ranging training opportunities, and generate future R and K proposals. Narrative Insufficient sleep is common, and leads to insulin resistance, a major factor in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

"Determinants of insufficient sleep among blacks and effects on disparities in health outcomes Project Summary Insufficient sleep (IS), stemming from sleep apnea, shift work, insomnia, working over 40 hr./week, unfavorable sleep environments and/or volitional reduction of bedtime, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) markers (elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and arterial stiffness), inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and C-reactive protein) as well as with brain injury. Compelling evidence shows racial/ethnic disparities in insufficient sleep (IS), with blacks exhibiting a three-fold greater risk of IS relative to whites. Disparities might arise from physiologic and genetic factors, but recent evidence suggests environmental and psychosocial factors are also critical determinants. This study will utilize innovative dynamic modeling in a multi-level framework to delineate the psychosocial and environmental determinants (associative factors) of actigraphic IS and its putative associations with adverse health outcomes among blacks. Individual- and contextual-level data will be captured using novel home-based recordings and GIS data to model the environmental context where sleep occurs. The proposed study will leverage success of the NYU Sleep Disparity Workgroup led by Dr. Jean- Louis (PI), who has been conducting community-engaged sleep research for over 10 years. The workgroup comprises outstanding investigators with expertise in sleep and circadian rhythm, CVD, brain health, health disparities, translational behavioral medicine, and multi-level dynamic modeling. The study will benefit from experience of our standing Community Steering Committee, enabling recruitment of 560 blacks in various venues to participate in weeklong home studies to achieve proposed study aims. The multidisciplinary team will: 1) identify psychosocial (social support, discrimination, and attitudes/beliefs) and environmental (household [density, noise, light, and temperature], socioeconomic position, social capital, and neighborhood [built environment]) factors that are associated with IS; ascertain effects of IS on (a) markers of CVD (obesity, BP, lipid profile, and glucose/ HbA1C) and inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) and on (b) markers of brain injury (tau, amyloid-β, neurofilament light, homocysteine, and glial fibrillary acidic protein; and develop profiles of blacks with IS-related adverse health outcomes using individual- and environmental-level data applying innovative multi-level dynamic modeling tools (Bayesia Belief Network and Agent-Based Simulation). This study will provide evidence to delineate factors underlying greater rates of IS among blacks and explain putative associations with markers of CVD, inflammation, and brain injury. These data will provide the foundation for longitudinal studies assessing causal effects of IS on these novel markers and interventions to mitigate adverse effects of IS on health outcomes. Project Narrative This proposal is predicated upon compelling data that blacks exhibit a three-fold greater risk of insufficient sleep (<7 hours) compared with whites, and that insufficient sleep is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and brain injury.

"Determinants of insufficient sleep among blacks and effects on disparities in health outcomes Project Summary Insufficient sleep (IS), stemming from sleep apnea, shift work, insomnia, working over 40 hr./week, unfavorable sleep environments and/or volitional reduction of bedtime, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) markers (elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and arterial stiffness), inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and C-reactive protein) as well as with brain injury. Compelling evidence shows racial/ethnic disparities in insufficient sleep (IS), with blacks exhibiting a three-fold greater risk of IS relative to whites. Disparities might arise from physiologic and genetic factors, but recent evidence suggests environmental and psychosocial factors are also critical determinants. This study will utilize innovative dynamic modeling in a multi-level framework to delineate the psychosocial and environmental determinants (associative factors) of actigraphic IS and its putative associations with adverse health outcomes among blacks. Individual- and contextual-level data will be captured using novel home-based recordings and GIS data to model the environmental context where sleep occurs. The proposed study will leverage success of the NYU Sleep Disparity Workgroup led by Dr. Jean- Louis (PI), who has been conducting community-engaged sleep research for over 10 years. The workgroup comprises outstanding investigators with expertise in sleep and circadian rhythm, CVD, brain health, health disparities, translational behavioral medicine, and multi-level dynamic modeling. The study will benefit from experience of our standing Community Steering Committee, enabling recruitment of 560 blacks in various venues to participate in weeklong home studies to achieve proposed study aims. The multidisciplinary team will: 1) identify psychosocial (social support, discrimination, and attitudes/beliefs) and environmental (household [density, noise, light, and temperature], socioeconomic position, social capital, and neighborhood [built environment]) factors that are associated with IS; ascertain effects of IS on (a) markers of CVD (obesity, BP, lipid profile, and glucose/ HbA1C) and inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) and on (b) markers of brain injury (tau, amyloid-β, neurofilament light, homocysteine, and glial fibrillary acidic protein; and develop profiles of blacks with IS-related adverse health outcomes using individual- and environmental-level data applying innovative multi-level dynamic modeling tools (Bayesia Belief Network and Agent-Based Simulation). This study will provide evidence to delineate factors underlying greater rates of IS among blacks and explain putative associations with markers of CVD, inflammation, and brain injury. These data will provide the foundation for longitudinal studies assessing causal effects of IS on these novel markers and interventions to mitigate adverse effects of IS on health outcomes. Project Narrative This proposal is predicated upon compelling data that blacks exhibit a three-fold greater risk of insufficient sleep (<7 hours) compared with whites, and that insufficient sleep is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and brain injury.

"Improving Outcomes in Pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea with Computational Fluid Dynamics PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to create a validated computational tool to predict surgical outcomes for pediatric patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is a common condition, affecting 2.2 million children in the USA alone. It is characterized as upper airway obstruction during sleep, which causes disrupted sleep and leads to developmental delay, cardiovascular complications and impaired growth. The first line of treatment for children with OSA is to remove their tonsils and adenoids; however, these surgeries do not always cure the patient. Another treatment, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is only tolerated by 50% of children. Therefore, many children undergo surgical interventions aimed at soft tissue structures surrounding the airway, such as tonsils, tongue, and soft palate, and/or the bony structures of the face. However, the success rates of these surgeries, measured as a reduction in the obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (obstructive events per hour of sleep), is surprisingly low. Therefore, there is a clear need for a tool to improve the efficacy of these surgeries and predict which of the various surgical options is going to benefit each individual patient most effectively. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of respiratory airflow in the upper airways can provide this predictive tool, allowing the effects of various surgical options to be compared virtually and the option most likely to improve the patient’s condition to be chosen. Previous CFD simulations have been unable to provide information about OSA as they were based on rigid geometries, or did not include neuromuscular motion, a key component in OSA. This project uses real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to provide the anatomy and motion of the airway to the CFD simulation, meaning that the exact in vivo motion is modeled for the first time. Furthermore, since the modeling is based on MRI, a modality which does not use ionizing radiation, it is suitable for longitudinal assessment of patients before and after surgical procedures. In vivo validation of these models will be achieved for the first time through comparison of CFD-based airflow velocity fields with those generated by phase-contrast MRI of inhaled hyperpolarized 129Xe gas. Cincinnati Children’s Hospital is a world leader in the fields of pediatric pulmonary and sleep medicine and radiology, and is the ideal environment to conduct the proposed research and for the PI to develop the essential skills to have a successful career as an independent investigator. The PI has identified primary mentors in both technical and clinical fields, and a further mentoring team to assist with specific aspects of this project. Between them, they have experience in MRI, sleep medicine, pulmonary medicine, CFD modeling, airway surgery, radiology, and biostatistics, as well as career development through this award mechanism. Their knowledge strengthens and complements the PI’s background in computational modeling of the airways and airflow within. The successful award of this project would afford the PI the opportunity to establish himself as a world leader in airway biomechanics and to improve the quality of life for pediatric patients with OSA. PROJECT NARATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea is a serious upper-airway condition in children, as chronic lack of sleep causes many problems such as developmental delay and heart abnormalities; however, surgeries aimed at relieving symptoms are often not successful. In this proposal a combination of fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) will be used to assess how inhaled air interacts with the anatomy of the airway to predict how this will change after surgery.

"Microtemporal Processes Underlying Health Behavior Adoption and Maintenance SUMMARY Emerging adulthood (ages 18-24 years) is marked by substantial weight gain, leading to increased lifetime risks of cancer and other chronic diseases. Engaging in sufficient levels of physical activity and sleep, and limiting sedentary time are important contributors to the prevention of weight gain. However, engaging in these healthy behaviors peaks during the childhood and adolescent years, and steeply deteriorates into emerging adulthood. Interventions promoting physical activity, reduced sedentary time, and sufficient sleep typically focus on the adoption of these behaviors. Yet, when these interventions are successful, new patterns of behavior are not maintained and typically regress back to baseline levels. Traditional health behavior theories provide limited guidance regarding factors underlying behavior maintenance. To address this gap, our work suggests that dual-process models of decision-making and behavior can shed light on differences in the mechanisms underlying adoption versus maintenance. Reflective processes (e.g., efficacy, deliberations, self-control) may be activated to a greater extent during behavior adoption. In contrast, reactive processes (e.g., contextual cues, automaticity, habits) may play a greater role in behavior maintenance. However, reactive processes are difficult to measure using retrospective methods because they can unfold on a micro-timescale (i.e., change across minutes or hours). To solve this problem, we propose to use real-time mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data examining differences in the micro-temporal processes underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, low sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration. We will conduct a prospective within- subject case-crossover observational study across a 12-month period. Ethnically-diverse, emerging adults (ages 18-24, N=300) will be recruited from the Happiness & Health Cohort (R01DA033296). We will conduct intermittent self-report (i.e., ecological momentary assessment) of reflective variables; and continuous, sensor- based passive monitoring of reactive variables (e.g., location, social proximity, voice/text communication) and behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary time, sleep) using smartwatches and smartphones. These data will be used to predict within-subject variation (within-days, between-days) in the likelihood of behavior “episodes” (e.g., ≥10 min of physical activity, ≥120 min sedentary time, ≥7 hr sleep) and “lapses” (i.e., failure to achieve recommended levels ≥7 days). The specific aims are to (1) idiographically use machine learning to identify person-specific combinations of time-varying reflective and reactive factors that predict behavior episodes and lapse; and (2) nomothetically determine whether there are general, group-level patterns of time-varying predictors, and whether those patterns predict successful behavior maintenance outcomes. The data and methods from this project will contribute to the U01/U24 Intensive Longitudinal Behavior Initiative’s collective goal to build more predictive health behavior theories that specify targets for personalized interventions.

Interventions promoting physical activity, reduced sedentary time, and sufficient sleep typically focus on the adoption of these behaviors. Yet, when these interventions are successful, new patterns of behavior are not maintained and typically regress back to baseline levels. Traditional health behavior theories provide limited guidance regarding factors underlying behavior maintenance. To address this gap, our work suggests that dual-process models of decision-making and behavior can shed light on differences in the mechanisms underlying adoption versus maintenance. Reflective processes (e.g., efficacy, deliberations, self-control) may be activated to a greater extent during behavior adoption. In contrast, reactive processes (e.g., contextual cues, automaticity, habits) may play a greater role in behavior maintenance. However, reactive processes are difficult to measure using retrospective methods because they can unfold on a micro-timescale (i.e., change across minutes or hours). To solve this problem, we propose to use real-time mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data examining differences in the micro-temporal processes underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, low sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration. We will conduct a prospective within- subject case-crossover observational study across a 12-month period. Ethnically-diverse, emerging adults (ages 18-24, N=300) will be recruited from the Happiness & Health Cohort (R01DA033296). We will conduct intermittent self-report (i.e., ecological momentary assessment) of reflective variables; and continuous, sensor- based passive monitoring of reactive variables (e.g., location, social proximity, voice/text communication) and behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary time, sleep) using smartwatches and smartphones. These data will be used to predict within-subject variation (within-days, between-days) in the likelihood of behavior “episodes” (e.g., ≥10 min of physical activity, ≥120 min sedentary time, ≥7 hr sleep) and “lapses” (i.e., failure to achieve recommended levels ≥7 days). The specific aims are to (1) idiographically use machine learning to identify person-specific combinations of time-varying reflective and reactive factors that predict behavior episodes and lapse; and (2) nomothetically determine whether there are general, group-level patterns of time-varying predictors, and whether those patterns predict successful behavior maintenance outcomes. The data and methods from this project will contribute to the U01/U24 Intensive Longitudinal Behavior Initiative’s collective goal to build more predictive health behavior theories that specify targets for personalized interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Weight gain increases dramatically emerging adulthood, increasing risk of cancer and chronic disease later in life. This study will use mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data on micro-temporal mechanisms underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, limited sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration in emerging adults. Results will be used to build more predictive health behavior theories and inform personalized behavior interventions to reduce obesity and improve public health.",Microtemporal Processes Underlying Health Behavior Adoption and Maintenance,9762623,U01HL146327,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Predictive Factor', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Role', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Sleep', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Voice', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'communication behavior', 'demographics', 'design', 'emerging adult', 'emerging adulthood', 'ethnic diversity', 'improved', 'lifetime risk', 'mobile computing', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'sleep behavior', 'smart watch', 'social', 'successful intervention', 'theories', 'trend', 'weight gain prevention']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2019,100000,0.18095904137868327
"Leveraging National Sleep Research Resource Data for Personalized Sleep Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY People vary in both the quantity and the quality of their sleep. Traditional sleep “stages” (for example, slow- wave sleep or REM sleep) can exhibit different neural correlates (as measured by electroencephalography, EEG) in different people and at different times during the night. Standard approaches for characterizing sleep (“staging”) do not take this variability into account, however. Here we suggest that attempts to use EEG and other data to infer sleep stages should in fact tackle the heterogeneity between and within individuals explicitly, to yield more accurate classification not just of an individual’s minute-by-minute sleep, but of the sleeper’s typical characteristics more generally. Quantitative, data-driven individual sleep profiles will be important prerequisites for emerging large-scale molecular genetics and other ‘omics studies of sleep, and for driving personalized sleep medicine more generally. Specifically, we propose to leverage more than ten thousand whole-night polysomnography (PSG) studies from the demographically diverse National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR), in order to optimally apply machine-learning methods to sleep signals. Most importantly, the NSRR dataset will enable approaches that take the fundamental heterogeneity of sleep into account: this is a rate-limiting step that has not been tackled by previous approaches. We hypothesize that it is not the large training set per se, but rather the increased prospects for better-matched training data, combined with the methods developed here, that will be beneficial. To this end, we will build and disseminate a novel, multi-level automated sleep classifier based on the world’s largest dataset of sleep signals.

"Cardiovascular implications of sleep characteristics using real-world objective sleep data Project Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the U.S. Impaired sleep is recognized as a strong risk factor of CVD. Sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, abnormal sleep duration, and poor sleep quality have each been associated with CVD-related morbidity and mortality. Major limitations of existing studies on sleep and CVD is the lack of objective sleep measurement and the lack of understanding of the multi-dimensional nature of sleep and its complex interactions with CVD. In addition, emerging evidence also suggests potential relationships between sleep disorders and preclinical CV conditions, which often occur before the clinical manifestation of CVD. Blood pressure parameters including systolic blood pressure variability (SBPV) and mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) are examples of preclinical CVD that have prognostic value for future CV events. However, no research has yet explored if sleep disorders beyond OSA (such as impaired sleep quality and abnormal sleep duration) are risk factors attributable to preclinical CV conditions. This is a critical area of inquiry since understanding the complex relationships between sleep and preclinical and clinical CV conditions will allow healthcare providers to implement targeted interventions to reduce CVD. The proposed study will examine whether PSG-derived objective measures of sleep obtained in the clinical setting would be predictive of CVD and preclinical CVD. Given that hypertension is one of the major important CV risks and has been most well studied CV risk factor in relation to sleep, SBPV, mean SBP, and other blood pressure metrics will be the focus of the preclinical CVD. Our main aim is to examine the relationships between multidimensional sleep characteristics (in terms of duration, efficiency, quality, and disordered sleep breathing) and clinical CV conditions, after adjusting for personal, clinical, and other confounders. We will use sleep data collected from more than 7,000 individuals who completed a diagnostic sleep study at the University of Virginia Health System in 2010 - 2018. Machine learning (ML) models will be used to analyze the multidimensional PSG measures. This proposed study represents the largest real-world dataset on objective sleep measures, which will allow us to simultaneously examine the entire spectrum of sleep and advance our understanding about the impact of sleep on CV outcomes. Project Narrative Impaired sleep is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and other adverse health outcomes. We will examine how various dimensions of sleep including duration, efficiency, and disordered breathing from polysomnography are related to cardiovascular risk within a healthcare setting. To better understand the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism, we will examine how sleep measures may affect blood pressure variability, an emerging yet underappreciated blood pressure parameter to be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.",Cardiovascular implications of sleep characteristics using real-world objective sleep data,10048498,R21HL150502,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Manifestation', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nature', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Prevention Measures', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'REM Sleep', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiration Disorders', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'blood pressure variability', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'effective intervention', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'indexing', 'limb movement', 'mortality', 'pre-clinical', 'prognostic value', 'risk minimization', 'sleep abnormalities', 'sleep quality', 'sleep quantity', 'supervised learning']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2020,137730,0.475279197932085
"DORMIR: Determinants, Outcomes, Responses and Markers of  Insufficient sleep in Rural-Urban settings Project Summary The widening gap in all-cause and CVD-mortality and morbidity rates in rural and urban America is at an all- time high. Latino/as, the largest minority ethnic group in the U.S., appear to be most affected by rural-urban divide in CVD outcomes, as they are disproportionately burdened by CVD risk (overweight/obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes) and CVD mortality (20%, 2nd leading cause of death among Latino/as) relative to other racial/ethnic groups. Unlike other groups where individuals in rural and urban areas have differing CVD risk, rural and urban Latino/as have similarly high rates of CVD risk. Although, healthy diets/ nutrition, smoking cessation, and regular physical activity are linked to CVD risk, they have not been very effective in reducing the CVD burden among racial/ethnic groups, specifically among Latino/as. Several studies indicate that insufficient sleep (<7hrs./day) explains a significant amount of the CVD burden among Latino/as. Preliminary evidence indicates that insufficient sleep may contribute to the observed CVD burden among Latino/as, as Latino/as have greater odds of experiencing insufficient sleep compared with non-Hispanic whites. Evidence also shows that insufficient sleep, which is associated with potentially life-threatening CVD, is a key modifiable risk factor with great potential to reduce health disparities. However, it is unclear what factors contribute to insufficient sleep (IS) disparities and IS-related CVD burden among rural and urban Latino/as. To address these gaps, we will enroll 525 Latino/as in rural and urban communities to participate in home-based studies using novel mHealth devices. The multidisciplinary team will: 1) identify behavioral, genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors that are associated with insufficient sleep and IS-related CVD and 2) assess effects of insufficient sleep on CVD risk markers (obesity, blood pressure, lipid profile, and fasting plasma glucose/ HbA1C) and inflammatory risk markers (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α). This study will provide multi-level evidence supporting epidemiological findings of greater rates of insufficient sleep among Latino/as, which may explain their disproportionate burden of CVD risk. It will also assess whether and why rural and urban differences in IS exist among Latino/as and how that may lead to IS-related CVD outcomes. These data will provide: 1) the foundation for interventions to mitigate adverse effects of insufficient sleep on CVD health outcomes, 2) evidence to delineate factors underlying insufficient sleep and CVD burden among Latino/as in rural and urban settings, and 3) a possible explanation of behavioral, genetic, environmental and psychosocial determinants of insufficient sleep and related CVD risk factors in rural and urban Latino/as. Findings can lead to actionable clinical, lifestyle, and policy interventions to improve Latino health. Project Narrative This proposal is predicated upon compelling data that Latino/as exhibit a greater risk of insufficient sleep (<7 hours) compared with whites, and that insufficient sleep is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and inflammation. It will provide multi-level evidence on behavioral, genetic, psychosocial and environmental determinants of insufficient sleep and sleep-related CVD risk and inflammation markers among rural and urban Latino/as. These data will provide the foundation for interventions to mitigate adverse effects of insufficient sleep on health outcomes.","DORMIR: Determinants, Outcomes, Responses and Markers of  Insufficient sleep in Rural-Urban settings",9976872,R01HL152453,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air', 'Americas', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Birth Place', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Circadian desynchrony', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet and Nutrition', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Household', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Level of Evidence', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population Study', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Seminal', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleeplessness', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'actigraphy', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'built environment', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'circadian', 'clinically actionable', 'density', 'design', 'diverse data', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fasting plasma glucose', 'good diet', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'mHealth', 'models and simulation', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'population based', 'psychosocial', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'response biomarker', 'rural area', 'rural setting', 'sex', 'sleep health', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'success', 'tool', 'urban area', 'urban disparity', 'urban setting']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,847392,0.43007885834697046
"Eavesdropping on heart-brain conversations during sleep for early detection and prevention of fatal cardiovascular disease ABSTRACT  The intimate link between the heart, brain and sleep is central to our well-being and ability to meet the demands of life. A majority of cardiovascular (CV) deaths occur in the early waking hours from sleep. For example, sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), an extremely prevalent and devastating condition, claims more lives (>350,000/year) in the USA than all disease-related causes of death combined. A defibrillator can prevent SCA, but current clinical strategies are grossly inadequate, both in terms of identifying people at risk and importantly, monitoring and controlling the CV risk. To address this major gap, we are proposing an entirely novel approach for studying heart-brain interactions during sleep. To our knowledge, our compelling new preliminary data and innovative strategy are unprecedented.  In robust preliminary studies of animals and humans, we have identified unique signatures of evolving, potentially fatal, CV disease within electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms that otherwise cannot be detected by current clinical methods and conventional statistics. Our powerful new tools reveal these “hidden” signatures during sleep (i.e., as conscious activity decreases and autonomic control of the heart becomes prominent). This missing link we have identified between the heart, brain, spontaneous intrinsic arousals, and critical CV disease is independent (in multivariate analyses) of sleep disordered breathing (e.g., apnea) and established risk factors. Our novel and highly promising findings may account for the high incidence of CV deaths associated with sleep and have potential for broad application, ranging from animal models to improved reclassification of individuals currently consid- ered “low”, “moderate” or “high” risk in contemporary clinical practice. This is important because asymptomatic individ- uals without advanced CV disease comprise the majority of SCA victims. They also are the ones “missed” by current risk stratification methods and the most challenging to identify. Further, our fundamental new approach to EEG and ECG analysis will add new, clinically valuable, prognostic insight for patients with advanced CV disease (e.g., heart failure). This robust, inexpensive, personalized strategy for identifying who will and will not need lifesaving therapy will also avoid unnecessary procedures and complications, and thus, will provide substantial socioeconomic benefits.  This paradigm-shifting application for a NIH Director’s New Innovator Award incorporates clinical cardiac electro- physiology, critical care and sleep medicine with engineering, mathematics, artificial intelligence, statistical dynamical systems, and molecular, cellular and clinical research to enable early diagnosis and therapy of critical CV disease. Our unique approach for gaining novel mechanistic insight into CV pathology and risk during sleep is likely to spawn new avenues in collaborative multidisciplinary research. Because our new paradigm can be seamlessly incorporated into existing technology readily available in hospitals and clinics, we expect our findings to rapidly transform contem- porary clinical practice in multiple fields. Importantly, the ability to identify and decode “hidden” EEG and ECG signa- tures of early onset of fatal, subclinical CV illness, including SCA, the leading cause of death in the industrialized world, has extraordinary implications for human health and the potential for broad worldwide application. NARRATIVE  The treatment of heart disease after clinical presentation has limited success. Irreversible organ system damage often initiates by the time the patient presents clinically. We seek to introduce, understand and validate a completely new approach for analyzing heart and brain signals to reveal information about evolving critical disease in an individual that otherwise would remain undetected by current clinical methods until catastrophic clinical presentation. If validated, this new paradigm will have extraordinary implications for human health and the potential to open new avenues in research and therapy.",Eavesdropping on heart-brain conversations during sleep for early detection and prevention of fatal cardiovascular disease,10002962,DP2HL157941,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Apnea', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Pathology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Conscious', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Defibrillators', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Engineering', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'body system', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'dynamic system', 'early onset', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized strategies', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'socioeconomics', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,DP2,2020,2407500,0.25810109658970204
