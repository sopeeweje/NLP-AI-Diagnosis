"TOXICOLOGY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICALS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research in this competitive PPG renewal, Toxicity of Environmental Chemicals, is focused on understanding the mechanisms of toxicity of selected environmental chemicals and the basic biochemical mechanisms involving the immune system, cellular function, oxidative stress and gene expression that may be altered through adverse effects of environmental chemicals. The overriding theme of this interdisciplinary research PPG is protein-ligand, protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling pathways. This PPG will depend on a combination of experimental strategies involving whole animal models, and biochemical and molecular biological methods; a variety of biophysical methods including mass spectrometry and kinetics to address questions relating to regulation in the immune system and cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix; nitration of proteins by peroxynitrite; and signaling pathways in RA-dependent transcription factors. These studies will specifically focus on: (1) identifying the signaling pathways in T lymphocytes that are altered by TCDD-induced AhR activation leading to T cell dysfunction, (2) determining the mechanisms involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility by PDGF, (3) elucidating the mechanisms by which oxidation of proteins by peroxynitrite interferes with protein-protein interactions, (4) investigating the role of GRASP and the tumor suppressor, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), in signaling pathways induced by RA, and (5) elucidating the mechanisms and dynamics involved in RA receptor-mediated gene expression induced by RA, methoprene acid, and other agonists. Experimental approaches to be used include flow cytometry, UV circular dichroism, fluorescence, quench and stopped-flow kinetics, and new techniques developed under the existing PPG (ES00040), including high speed cell sorting, a differential proteolytic sensitivity assay, H/D exchange, and singular value decomposition for analyzing multistate unfolding events at equilibrium. A Mass Spectrometry Core will provide mass spectrometry support for the individual Projects.

"CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION-INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES This research will provide new, fundamental information concerning chemical communication in a primate species.  The overall long-range objective is to define the chemical nature and behavioral significance of the scent marks utilized by the South American tamarin, Saguinus fuscicollis, a member of the family Callitrichidae, in social and sexual communication.  Studies are proposed to elucidate in detail those chemical patterns which encode gender and species.  A combination of analytical techniques, pattern recognition methods and behavioral assays will identify those components or patterns of compounds, both volatile and non-volatile, which are associated with the commmunicatory information.  Bacteriological studies will determine which of the active components are of bacterial origin. In addition, a pilot study will assess the possible role of the fatty acids in encoding individual differences in the scent marks.  We anticipate that this research will lead to a much more complete understanding of the nature of the chemical code in this primate species, and in the end that it will be possible to reconstruct with synthetic formulations a variety of the communicatory signals employed by the tamarins.  To accomplish this goal, a unique interdisciplinary research team consisting of two organic chemists, a primatologist and two bacteriologists, as well as a pattern recognition expert has been assembled at the Monell Chemical Senses Center.

Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug discovery platform that seeks to re-purpose known drugs for the treatment of such diseases. The platform consists of high content immunofluorescent image analysis and transcellular resistance measurements. These measurements evaluated using machine-learning algorithms to identify relevant and on- target changes induced by both RNAi and various chemicals. These assays can be simultaneously performed on thousands of rare genetic disease models. In this grant, we specifically propose to:  Model 2,000 genetic diseases in multiple human cell types using RNAi technology.  Identify and prioritize 200 of these disease models with the most compelling phenotypic changes, according to multi-parametric quantification.  Utilize these 200 disease models as the basis of chemical suppressor screens of thousands of known drug candidates.  Validate the 20 best drug/disease combinations using an orthogonal genetic manipulation technique in human cells.  Study the best five to ten validated drug/disease combinations in relevant animal models. The proposed study would have significant societal and commercial implications.

"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN PROCESS PLANT SAFETY The major goal of this proposal is to research and demonstrate new approaches based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) towards the design of chemical process hazard detection, prevention, and control systems.  Such systems are extremely important for improving the occupational safety of chemical plants owing to the complexity of modern process plants.  Industrial statistics show that even though major catastrophies and disasters from chemical plant failures are infrequent, minor accidents are very common, occurring on a day to day basis, resulting in many occupational injuries and illnesses, costing the society billions of dollars every year.  The proposed project is aimed at the prevention and control of such frequent, day to day, accidental events in the industry. Past approaches in fault diagnostic systems did not properly include the human expert's reasoning strategies and experience and hence were not adequate in efficient and correct trouble- shooting.  We propose to improve this status by designing systems that would have better modeling of the problem-solving process through an appropriate representation of the domain knowledge through the use of causal modeling and reasoning from first principles, similar to human experts, by exploiting some of the recent advances in Artificial Intelligence.  We propose a methodology that aids the development of expert systems which are process-independent, transparent in their reasoning, resilient under unforeseen fault combinations, and capable of diagnosing a wide diversity of faults.  The domain knowledge of the system is based on a library of fault and causal models of process equipments as well as on the physical interconnections between equipment units and causal relationships among process state variables.  The inference strategy uses model-based reasoning for analyzing the plant behavior.  We describe a prototype expert system, called MODEX, based on our methodology.  The system has performed successfully on test cases of prototypical chemical process plants and looks promising.  However, before a successful transfer of this methodology to the industry can be initiated a number of research issues outlined in the proposal need to be resolved by experimenting with larger prototypical chemical plants.  n/a",ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN PROCESS PLANT SAFETY,3420587,R01OH002352,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder prevention /control', ' industry', ' occupational disease /disorder', ' occupational hazard', ' occupational psychology', ' safety equipment']",NIOSH,PURDUE UNIVERSITY WEST LAFAYETTE,R01,1989,59219,0.07000703470030106

"Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a novel approach based on deep learning neural networks to encode molecules into chemically rich vectors. We will first apply this representation to build more powerful computational models that can more accurately predict properties such as bioactivity, ADME/ Tox, and pharmacokinetics across libraries of molecular structures. The ultimate goal is to leverage this repre- sentation to generate novel compounds with better combinations of properties. Both of these capabilities will help scientists to accelerate discovery of new drugs broadly across many therapeutic areas.  Scientists engaged in drug discovery research from academic laboratories to large pharmaceutical companies rely on computational QSAR models to predict pharmacologically relevant properties and obviate the need to perform expensive, time-consuming assays (many of which require animal studies) for every molecule of interest. Some properties (e.g. logP) can now be modeled with such high confidence that the models have replaced the need to perform the assays, but many other critical properties (e.g. solubility, ADME, PK, hERG) remain far from this goal. We expect that our proposed chemically rich vectors will significantly advance the state of the art beyond what can be achieved with conventional descriptors and fingerprints. Improved models will enable researchers to select lead candidate series more effectively, explore chemical space around leads to generate novel IP more efficiently, reduce failure rates for compounds advancing through the drug discovery pipeline, and accelerate the entire drug discovery process. These benefits will be realized broadly across most therapeutic areas.  Our central innovation is a novel computational strategy: first develop a deep learning (DL) model optimized to best capture the essential structural and chemical features of molecules, starting from the most natural structural representation; then validate the DL model by applying it to improve QSAR modeling of pharmacological properties; and finally extend it to generate previously unknown molecules that have superior properties – the so-called “inverse QSAR” problem, which is the Holy Grail of computational medicinal chemistry. Others have unsuccessfully tried to leap directly to solve the inverse QSAR problem. We propose a more patient and methodical approach that will allow the neural network to perform self-supervised training to learn about chemical structures and properties from readily available, extremely large datasets, then transfer this learning to improve modeling; only after establishing this solid foundation do we intend to apply the models to attempt inverse QSAR. Prior attempts in this area have also relied on neural network architectures designed originally for language processing. We will design a new architecture, more akin to neural network architectures that have proven most successful at image classification, and optimize it to directly process the “molecular graph” that represents the relationship of atoms and bonds in molecules. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to understand whether potential new drugs are likely to be both safe and effective, and identify similar compounds that are likely to be safer and more effective against the same target. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. !",Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts,9612249,R43TR002527,"['Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Bank', 'Molecular Structure', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Solid', 'Solubility', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'computational chemistry', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lead candidate', 'lead series', 'learning strategy', 'molecular vector', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'vector', 'voice recognition']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R43,2018,149830,0.015697088925161688
"Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a suite of software modules to enable scientists to unambiguously represent chemical mixtures in standard machine-readable formats, filling an urgent and widely-recognized need. Chemicals are typically formulated as mixtures. Recording and communicating information about chemical mixtures is essential for scientists and support staff in the pharmaceutical industry, in academia, in non-profit research organizations, in government, at specialty chemical vendors, and at commercial manufacturers to: • discover, develop, formulate, manufacture and regulate drugs; • manage reagent inventories; comply with laboratory safety requirements; inform first responders; • describe and reproduce biomedical experiments; and • assess and disseminate information about toxicity risks of chemical reagents and consumer products.  A working committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is close to formalizing “Mixtures InChI” (or MInChI), which will extend the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) to become the first standard to encompass mixtures. MInChI will effectively index mixtures in the same way that InChI indexes individual compounds.  CDD will first develop the data structures and software necessary to enable adoption and utilization of MInChI and create the first general-purpose system for recording information about chemical mixtures that is computable and interoperable. The most innovative part of the project and the bulk of the effort will be to develop a sophisticated automated translation tool that will accurately convert legacy catalogs of chemical mixtures from plaintext descriptions or ad hoc formats so that they are properly represented in a machine readable format that can in turn be easily rendered into MInChI identifiers. The broad vision is to help industry to overcome the barriers to adoption so that MInChI can quickly deliver benefits for drug discovery, chemical safety, and toxicology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accurately document the composition of chemical mixtures in a format that computers can easily interpret, process, and exchange. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. It will also help to advance our understanding of the toxicology of mixtures (which often differs from the toxicology of individual components) and improve laboratory safety both in industry and in educational settings. !",Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation,9611819,R43TR002528,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Anti-HIV Agents', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Government', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Readability', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shorthand', 'Solvents', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'consumer product', 'data structure', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'emergency service responder', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R43,2018,149471,0.18714038060767163
"Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a suite of software modules to enable scientists to unambiguously represent chemical mixtures in standard machine-readable formats, filling an urgent and widely-recognized need. Chemicals are typically formulated as mixtures. Recording and communicating infor- mation about chemical mixtures is essential for scientists and support staff in the pharmaceutical industry, in academia, in non-profit research organizations, in government, at specialty chemical vendors, and at commer- cial manufacturers to: • discover, develop, formulate, manufacture and regulate drugs; • manage reagent inventories; comply with laboratory safety requirements; inform first responders; • describe and reproduce biomedical experiments; and • assess and disseminate information about toxicity risks of chemical reagents and consumer products.  A working committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is close to for- malizing “Mixtures InChI” (or MInChI), which will extend the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) to be- come the first standard to encompass mixtures. MInChI will effectively index mixtures in the same way that InChI indexes individual compounds.  In Phase 1 CDD developed the data structures and software necessary to enable adoption and utilization of MInChI and create the first general-purpose system for recording information about chemical mixtures that is computable and interoperable. In Phase 2 CDD will continue to develop a sophisticated automated transla- tion tool that will accurately convert legacy catalogs of chemical mixtures from plaintext descriptions or ad hoc formats so that they are properly represented in a machine readable format that can in turn be easily rendered into MInChI identifiers. The broad vision is to help industry to overcome the barriers to adoption so that ma- chine readable mixture descriptions can quickly deliver benefits for drug discovery, chemical safety, and toxi- cology.

"NEURAL NETWORKS FOR PROCESS FAULT DIAGNOSIS AND SAFETY The major goal of this proposal is to research and demonstrate a new approach based on the emerging technology of Neural Networks in the discipline of Artificial Intelligence (AI) towards the design of chemical process hazard detection, prevention, and control systems. Such systems are extremely important for improving the occupational safety of chemical plants owing to the complexity of modern process plants.  The proposed project is aimed at the prevention and control of such frequent, day to day, accidental events in the industry.  Past approaches in fault diagnostic systems did not properly include the human expert's reasoning strategies and experience and hence were not adequate in efficient and correct trouble-shooting.  In this project, we propose a novel methodology using Neural Networks that address the important issues which are central to the development of knowledge-based systems for process fault diagnosis and hazard control.

"KNOWLEDGE-BASED FRAMEWORK TO AUTOMATE HAZOP ANALYSIS Hazard and operability (Hazop) analysis is the study of systematically identifying every conceivable deviation, all the possible abnormal causes for such deviation, and the adverse hazardous consequences of that deviation in a chemical plant. Modern chemical plants are extremely complex and hence are difficult to analyze and assess from this Hazop perspective, thus raising serious occupational safety related concerns. Because of this complexity, they are also more vulnerable to equipment failures, as witnessed by the recent chemical plant accidents. The major goal of this proposal is to develop a knowledge-based system framework for automating Hazop analysis of process plants. Such automated systems are extremely important for improving the occupational safety of chemical plants. Hazop analysis is often carried out by a group of experts poring over the process flowsheets for weeks or months. Thus, Hazop analysis is a very difficult, labor-intensive, and time-consuming process. In our proposed knowledge-based framework, we recognize and exploit two important features of the Hazop analysis: (i) even though each Hazop analysis is unique-to a process, it is systematic and logical; and (ii) many aspects of the analysis are the same for different process flow sheets. Thus, Hazop analysis can be automated through the use of knowledge-based systems. In this project, we propose a knowledge-based systems approach which introduces several novel techniques in a model-based framework to attack this problem. These are: (i) decomposing the knowledge-base into process specific and process general knowledge, (ii) developing generic cause-and-effect models of various processes and process equipments, and (iii) an object-oriented implementation framework. We have successfully tested the proposed approach on a small prototypical case study. Encouraged by the preliminary results, we propose to investigate this approach further by developing more comprehensive generic models library of complex process equipments, process interactions, process materials, and by testing on complex industrial scale Hazop case studies. We also propose to develop efficient search techniques for managing the complexity, handle recycle and feedback loops, and develop an intelligent object-oriented graphical interface for this system.  n/a",KNOWLEDGE-BASED FRAMEWORK TO AUTOMATE HAZOP ANALYSIS,2277684,R01OH003056,"['artificial intelligence', ' chemical synthesis', ' industry', ' occupational hazard', ' occupational health /safety']",NIOSH,PURDUE UNIVERSITY WEST LAFAYETTE,R01,1994,152600,0.13221879211808826

"Technology to Identify and Assay Chemical Genomic Probes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of this proposal is to develop and deploy cutting edge technologies and chemical genomic tools and to understand the effects of small molecule inhibitors in vivo, and to characterize the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae on a systems level. Over the course of the past 3.5 years, as part of an NHGRI-funded project, we have applied three unique genome-wide screens to ~2,000 chemical inhibitors of growth. These data have led to several notable findings, including: 1) novel drug/target interactions, 2) a chemical phenotype for nearly all yeast genes, 3) a systems-level characterization of yeast, and 4) a better understanding of chemical structure-activity relationships as they manifest in vivo. These data have also guided the design of the next-generation chemical genomic assays proposed herein. Using our established bioinformatics and robotics infrastructure, we will design the next generation of assays to interrogate the genome's interaction with small molecules to unprecedented levels of scrutiny, while decreasing cost per chemical.

"Technology to Identify and Assay Chemical Genomic Probes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of this proposal is to develop and deploy cutting edge technologies and chemical genomic tools and to understand the effects of small molecule inhibitors in vivo, and to characterize the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae on a systems level. Over the course of the past 3.5 years, as part of an NHGRI-funded project, we have applied three unique genome-wide screens to ~2,000 chemical inhibitors of growth. These data have led to several notable findings, including: 1) novel drug/target interactions, 2) a chemical phenotype for nearly all yeast genes, 3) a systems-level characterization of yeast, and 4) a better understanding of chemical structure-activity relationships as they manifest in vivo. These data have also guided the design of the next-generation chemical genomic assays proposed herein. Using our established bioinformatics and robotics infrastructure, we will design the next generation of assays to interrogate the genome's interaction with small molecules to unprecedented levels of scrutiny, while decreasing cost per chemical.

"FISH VENTILATORY BEHAVIOR AS A TOXIC'S MONITORING TOOL The long term objective is to develop a fish monitoring tool capable of rapidly screening chemicals for toxicity, protecting public drinking water supplies and wastewater receiving systems, and identifying the causative toxic agent(s).  Non-invasive electrode techniques receive signals from fish generated bioelectric fields.  Electronic components filter the signals generated from independently monitored fish such that the ventilatory components may be amplified and interfaced to a microcomputer. This and other laboratories have demonstrated that, upon exposure to acutely toxic chemical concentrations, several changes occur in the ventilatory components of fish, such as, frequency, amplitude, and gill purge or cough, including three major and eleven subcategories of the types of gill purge.  It is anticipated that the Phase I research will demonstrate that, upon exposure to chronically toxic chemical concentrations, the combinations of ventilatory components occurring will be unique to a given category of the chemical (e.g., concepts of structural activity relationships, heavy metal vs. pesticide, etc.).  Many chemicals that are toxic to humans and other mammilian systems are toxic to aquatic organisms.  If the long term objective is successful, this inexpensive monitoring tool would have commercal applications for the chemical manufacturing, drinking water and wastewater treatment industries, municipalities, and regulatory agencies, as well as the academic research community.  n/a",FISH VENTILATORY BEHAVIOR AS A TOXIC'S MONITORING TOOL,3496463,R43ES003808,"['aquatic biology', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioassay', ' chemical structure function', ' chlorohydrocarbon', ' cinematography', ' computer graphics /printing', ' environmental contamination', ' environmental toxicology', ' fresh water environment', ' gills', ' metal poisoning', ' monitoring device', ' pesticide biological effect', ' toxicant screening', ' trichloroethylene', ' water pollution', ' water pollution control', ' water sampling /testing', ' water supply', ' zinc']",NIEHS,"BIOLOGICAL MONITORING, INC.",R43,1985,50000,0.12752869405154085
"Comparative and Web-Enabled Virtual Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  PROJECT SUMMARY      The long-term objective of this project is to develop computational algorithms and software to gain theoretical and empirical insights in the use of chemical diversity for determining quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). In addition to addressing scientific and technical goals with respect to QSAR modeling, planning-period tasks will include specific activities to bring together the researchers and to facilitate inter-disciplinary communication.       Specific Aim 1 is to develop and enhance collaborations between three broad disciplines: statistics, computer science, and chemistry. This will be accomplished primarily through several intense workshops per year and regularly scheduled status meetings.       Specific Aim 2 is to initiate a benchmarking study to compare structural descriptors, modeling strategies, and methods of model assessment. Through a web server, results will be posted from analyzing several datasets using many QSAR modeling techniques, a variety of molecular descriptors, and a number of assessment criteria.       Specific Aim 3 is to design and beta-test web-accessibility of modeling software.

"QUANTIFYING NITROARENE GENOTOXICITY IN COMPLEX MIXTURES The biological activity of nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitroarenes) has ben the subject of extensive study primarily because of the potent mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of some nitroarenes as well as their widespread occurrence in the environment, principally as the result of incomplete combustion processes.  However, most of us are not exposed primarily to individual compounds but rather to complex mixtures both outdoors (emissions from automobiles, power plants, etc.) and indoors (cigarette smoke, heaters, stoves, ovens etc).  The objective of the work proposed in this application is to relate the genotoxic and carcinogenic activities of individual nitroarenes to activities of artificial mixtures and extracts of emission particulates in order to use data for single chemicals to evaluate the risk of exposure to complex mixtures.  The proposed project, which employs both computerized and experimental methodologies, will involve professionals with expertise in chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, artificial intelligence and risk assessment, and with extensive experience in the study of nitroarenes.  Two computerized techniques will be used.  First, Computer Automated Structure Evaluation (CASE), an artificial intelligence program which was developed to predict the mutagenicity of nitroarenes, will be used to identify structural determinants of mutagenicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. Second, the Carcinogenicity Prediction and Battery Selection (CPBS) method will used to identify appropriate batteries of short-term tests for screening individual nitroarenes and mixtures and to predict potential carcinogenicity, including carcinogenic potency.  Experimental studies will be directed towards assessing the activities of compounds in mixtures.  Artificial mixtures of pairs of nitroarenes or related compounds, as well as extracts of combustion emissions combined with individual chemicals, will be tested for mutagenicity, metabolic activation and deactivation of mutagenicity, mammalian genotoxicity and metabolic biotransformation.  Three issues will be addressed:  whether activities are additive or are influenced by competition for enzymatic activation, whether inactivating structures identified by CASE represent alternative biotransformation or competition and how the presence of a complex mixture influences the metabolism, mutagenicity and genotoxicity of individual chemicals.

"Integration of Metabolomics in Neuroimaging:Software for Brain NMR Spectroscopy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NMR spectroscopy is the most promising non-invasive method for assessing the biochemical state of the brain associated with different pathologies, including neurodegenerative and psychological disorders, cancer, inborn errors of metabolism, as well as for understanding the role of metabolites in the working brain. Incorporating metabolic information with the other modalities of neuro-imaging, however, is quite challenging. Chemical Shift Imaging acquires localized spectra in the brain in volumes as small as 0.4 cc, resulting in datasets containing hundreds of spectra. The goal of this grant application is to enhance software tool, 3D interactive Chemical Shift Imaging (3DiCSI), for comprehensive application to neuro-imaging data analysis. 3DiCSI combines data visualization, spectral processing, spectral localization and estimation, and spectral quantification together with spectral pattern recognition techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis and constrained Non-negative Matrix Factorization. The proposed developments will improve the automatic importation of raw data by including file formats from all scanner brands as well as interface spectroscopy data with other neuro-imaging software tools. The standardization of data exportation and providing multi- platform support for the program will promote the data-sharing in the community and allow for dynamic collection of spectral data for creation of annotated database of brain metabolic patterns. The ability for a user to extend the functionality of the program will render 3DiCSI as a research platform providing data visualization, preprocessing and multivariate analysis which can be used to enhance an individual researcher's analytical procedures. Parallelization of the data processing routines and extending the spectral pattern discovery procedures will allow for real time identification and interpretation of aberrant spectral signature, related to type and state of disease, particularly important for the clinical application of 3DiCSI. Generation of comprehensive report summarizing the spectroscopy exam will be also essential for communicating the results. Support for automatic online program update download and improved documentation will ensure utilization of the program to its greatest potential. These developments will greatly improve the interoperability, adoptability and usability of 3DiCSI and facilitate the utilization of spectroscopy in neuro-imaging applications.     n/a",Integration of Metabolomics in Neuroimaging:Software for Brain NMR Spectroscopy,7364077,R03EB008203,"['Address', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Brain', 'Chemical Shift Imaging', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inborn Errors of Metabolism', 'Individual', 'Invasive', 'Learning', 'Linux', 'Localized', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Numbers', 'Operating System', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Running', 'Software Tools', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Standardization', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Techniques', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized data processing', 'file format', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'metabolomics', 'neuroimaging', 'processing speed', 'programs', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2007,149058,0.03804802629894965
"Novel therapeutic agents from the bacterial symbionts of Brazilian invertebrates DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An International Cooperative Biodiversity Group (ICBG) with an interdisciplinary leadership team of physicians, pharmacologists, evolutionary biologists, and chemists will discover and develop therapeutic agents produced by Brazilian symbiotic bacteria. The team will target three therapeutic areas: 1) infectious fungal pathogens, 2) Chagas disease and leishmaniasis, and 3), cancers of the blood-all three of which represent major threats to human health that need to be addressed with new therapeutic agents. Internationally, invasive fungal diseases kill more people than malaria or TB, while Chagas disease imposes a special burden on Brazil, killing as many Brazilians as TB. Leishmaniasis has now passed Chagas disease in the Brazilian population. In spite of major improvements in cancer chemotherapy, cancer is projected to result in 8 million deaths internationally this year (13% of all deaths, WHO) and an estimated 13 million per year by 2030. This ICBG has focused screening platforms for all three diseases that will perform all the required steps from primary screens through in vivo mouse model studies. The ICBG will focus on identifying useful natural products from bacterial symbionts of social insects in Brazil, such as fungus-growing ants. Fungus-growing ants have specialized bacterial symbionts that provide chemical defenses against pathogenic fungi that threaten their communities. The ecological role of the bacterially produced chemical defenses - killing pathogenic fungi but sparing the fungal gardens and the insect host - matches the therapeutic requirements for antifungal, anticancer, and antiprotozoal agents. The population level diversity of the bacterial producers also provides the opportunity to identify multiple variants of a structural family, facilitating identification of active compounds ith better drug potential (e.g., lower mammalian toxicity, improved pharmacokinetics). Our discovery efforts will make extensive use of cutting-edge technology and genomic approaches. Bacteria will be micro-cultured for high-throughput primary phenotypic screens, and priority strains will be re-cultured for secondary screens and dereplication. All bacterial strains will be genotyped (16S), and strains advancing along pipelines will have their genomes sequenced and subjected to bioinformatic analysis. The data generated from our intensive sampling, phenotypic assays, chemical characterization, and genome sequencing will provide important insights into Brazilian microbial diversity and the ecological context and evolutionary selection of the natural products they produce. In addition, the ICBG will undertake major efforts to train Brazilian scientists, and support the development of drug discovery in the country. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is an unmet need for effective therapeutic agents for invasive fungal infections (candidiasis, aspergillosis, and mucormycosis) and protozoal parasite diseases (Chagas disease and leishmaniasis) along more effective therapeutic agents for cancers. The goals of this ICBG are to provide new therapeutic agents through a collaborative focus on high-value natural product leads produced by under-explored source of microbial diversity.",Novel therapeutic agents from the bacterial symbionts of Brazilian invertebrates,9748228,U19TW009872,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Address', 'Amoeba genus', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Antiprotozoal Agents', 'Ants', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biodiversity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brazil', 'Candidiasis', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chagas Disease', 'Chemicals', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Effectiveness', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Fractionation', 'Gardenal', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Leishmaniasis', 'Malaria', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Microbe', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Natural Products', 'Natural Products Chemistry', 'Natural Selections', 'Parasites', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Physicians', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Protozoa', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Study models', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transcription Factor AP-1', 'Transcription Factor AP-2 Alpha', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'field study', 'fungus', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'social', 'success', 'symbiont', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic development', 'tool']",FIC,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U19,2018,150000,0.05393858219144653

"Systematic data curation and integration to link models of human disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decades of experiments have produced vast amounts of data and identified a multitude of molecular processes that underlie specific biological functions directly relevant to human health.

"Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics specifically and potently block the expression of disease-related genes. siRNA clinical utility is currently limited to disease targets in the liver, but the Khvorova lab has developed a novel, fully chemically modified siRNA platform that enables delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) and results in potent modulation of gene expression in mouse and monkey brain for 6 months. This technology provides an opportunity to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders, including Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Extensive chemical modification protects siRNAs from degradation and is essential for in vivo delivery, but lowers the gene silencing efficacy of many siRNA sequences. Bioinformatics algorithms have been developed to predict the activity of non-modified siRNAs, but these algorithms cannot predict whether a chemically modified siRNA will be functional. Identifying a hyperfunctional siRNA chemical modification pattern and developing a predictive algorithm for modified siRNA sequences will be critical for the widespread application of this platform in vivo to treat AD and other genetically-linked neurological disorders. The goal of this proposal is to identify parameters that impact the silencing efficacy of chemically modified siRNAs. Aim 1 will identify the step(s) that limit the activity of chemically modified siRNAs. Using a validated AGO2- immunoprecipitation technique and a small RNA high-throughput sequencing protocol, loading of 32 chemically modified siRNA sequences, each with 3 different chemical modification patterns, into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) will be quantified, and these results will be compared to their in vitro silencing activity. These efforts will provide a data set to determine the impacts of chemistry and sequence on the different steps of RISC function. Aim 2 will design and screen 192 siRNAs in 6 different chemical modification patterns (i.e., for a total of 1152 siRNAs) to systematically assess if and how changes to siRNA sequence and chemical modification patterns impact siRNA efficacy. These 1152 siRNAs will target 4 different mRNAs identified as therapeutic targets for AD. Completing this aim will identify siRNAs that effectively reduce the expression of AD targets. Using multiple bioinformatics analysis methods, including multi-parameter linear regression, support vector machine, and random forest, Aim 3 will model algorithms that specifically predict functional, chemically modified siRNAs. The best performing algorithm will be determined by independent and cross-validations. Completion of this project will decrease the extent of in vitro screening needed to identify functional chemically modified siRNAs capable of targeting disease genes in the CNS and streamline the design of siRNA therapies to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics are a promising class of drugs for the treatment of genetic disorders. Chemical modification of siRNA is necessary for delivery to the central nervous system, but may hinder the efficacy of some siRNAs. This project will define the relationships between siRNA sequence, chemical modification patterns, and efficacy to streamline the development of clinically-relevant siRNAs capable of treating genetically-defined neurological disorders.",Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders,9992249,F31LM013111,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hela Cells', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Huntington Disease', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA Degradation', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Interference Therapy', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA-Induced Silencing Complex', 'Seeds', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Small RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'random forest', 'screening', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic RNA', 'therapeutic target']",NLM,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,F31,2020,30514,0.0006722408789263585
"Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID) PROJECT SUMMARY Small molecules are one of the most important classes of therapeutics alleviating suffering and in many cases death for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Small molecules also serve as invaluable tools to study biology, often with the goal to validate novel targets for the development of future therapeutic drugs. Reproducibility of experimental results and the interoperability and reusability of resulting datasets depend on accurate descriptions of associated research objects, and most critically on correct representations of small molecules that are tested in biological assays. For example, it is not possible to develop predictive models of protein target - small molecule interactions if their chemical structure representations are not correct. Many factors contribute to errors in reported chemical structures in small molecule screening and omics reference databases, scientific publications, and many other web-based resources and documents. Because of the complexity of representing small molecules chemical structure graphs and the lack of thorough curation, errors are frequently introduced by non-experts and error propagation across different digital research assets is a pervasive problem. To address this challenging problem via a scalable approach, we propose the Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID). AutoMID will be usable in batch mode at scale via an API, for example to assist chemical structure standardization and registration by maintainers of digital research assets, and also via interactive (UI) mode for everyday researchers to quickly and easily validate or correct their small molecule representations. AutoMID will leverage extensive highly standardized linked databases of chemical structures and associated information including names, synonyms, biological activity and physical properties and their sources / provenance and leverage expert rules and AI to enable reliable disambiguation of chemical structure identities at scale. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small molecules are one of the most important types of drugs. They also serve as invaluable tools to study biology. The complexity of representing chemical graphs and the lack of thorough curation leads to frequent small molecule structure errors, which propagate across digital research assets, impeding their interoperability and reusability.

"Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to establish an authoritative public database, the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; http://ctd.mdibl.org), that promotes understanding about the effects of environmental chemicals on human health. The etiology of most chronic diseases involves interactions between environmental and genetic factors. Although more than 85,000 chemicals are used in commerce today, the complex molecular mechanisms underlying the actions of most of these chemicals and their effects on human health are poorly understood. In CTD we will present scientifically reviewed information on environmental chemicals, significant genes, and their interactions in vertebrates and invertebrates. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) curate and integrate chemical-gene interactions from published literature and high-throughput experimental data (e.g., microarrays); 2) curate cross-species toxicologically important genes and their proteins; and 3) transform the CTD prototype into a robust, production-quality database ready for increased public use and more sophisticated data search and analysis capabilities. CTD will be the first database to focus its curation on chemical-gene interactions and genes of toxicological significance in diverse species to elucidate structure-function correlations.

"INTERNAL BONDING IN PROTEINS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term objective is to ascertain how protein conformation plays a role in biological function and in various diseases. Our specific aims are to finish our development of our physics-based united-residue (UNRES) approach to the protein folding problem, i.e., to compute structure, folding pathways, and thermodynamic and dynamic properties. This involves replacing the last remaining knowledge-based term, corresponding to side chain-side chain interactions, by physics-based terms, extension of UNRES to simulate folding of disulfide-containing proteins, and to treat the lipid-membrane environment. At the all-atom level, we will treat the pH-dependent ionization of side chains (including solvation), and the use of 13C1 chemical shifts in protein-structure simulation. We will continue the development of our UNRES model of nucleic acids (NA-UNRES) and merge UNRES and NA-UNRES into a viable package, which will be provided to the community. We will also continue the developments of sampling techniques and parallelization of UNRES/MD to carry out simulations of very large single-chain and oligomeric proteins and their complexes, and develop tools, based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for the analysis of mesoscopic-dynamics trajectories. We will demonstrate how these aims can lead to valid predictions of structures and folding pathways of proteins, and protein-nucleic acid and protein-protein complexes. Our main focus will then involve the application of this methodology to a biological problem: the mechanism of action of the human HSP70 chaperone.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As pointed out in the Project Summary, the long-term objective of this research is to ascertain how protein conformation plays a role in various diseases. Examples of such diseases in which conformation plays a role are sickle cell anemia (1) and amyloid diseases such as Alzheimer's (2) and mad cow disease.

"Electroanalysis of Neurotransmitters and Modulators The goals of this research proposal are to develop electrochemistry-based probes and ancillary tools to monitor neurotransmitters and other chemical substances in intact, functional brain tissue. Real-time measurements of chemical changes in the brain enable the regulatory kinetics and mechanisms to be . unravelled, and they also allow investigation of the alteration of these mechanisms by disease or drugs of abuse. Carbon-fiber microelectrodes will be employed with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. Developed in the previous project periods, this approach provides a dynamic view of neurotransmitters relaying information in the brain. The major target neurotransmitter is dopamine, and the metabolic indicators, molecular oxygen and local pH, will also be monitored. The specific aims involve new technology (Aims 1, 2, and 5) and innovative applications (Aims 3 and 4). They are: 1. To employ principle component analysis of cyclic voltammograms collected in vivo to extract the major contributors to the electrochemical signal. This will improve signal-to-noise ratios and will separate pH and dopamine changes. Its use will allow further insight into the changes induced by cocaine and cannabinoids. 2. To develop and use iontophoresis with voltammetry to introduce chemical substances directly at the site where pH and dopamine measurements are made. This will allow local mechanisms that regulate dopamine release and uptake to be probed. In freely moving animals, the local injections will avoid whole animal effects of injected pharmacological agents. 3. To investigate dopamine release from its cell bodies. Measurements will be made in the ventral tegmental area while antidromically activating dopamine fibers. The mechanisms that control release and uptake will be contrasted with those in the terminal regions. 4. To investigate dopamine neurotransmission and pH changes in a model of a disease state. R6/2 mice, a genetic model of Huntington's disease, will be used. Preliminary data indicate dopamine neurotransmission is impaired in these animals. We will investigate the origin of this impairment and probe regulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine neurotransmission and regulatin of pH. 5. To develop carbon electrodes with greater flexibility and less fragility. The proposed design uses various forms of carbon deposited on the tips of tungstem wires. These electrodes will facilitate measurements in behaving animals and the development of arrays of electrodes for in vivo use. n/a",Electroanalysis of Neurotransmitters and Modulators,7557823,R01NS015841,"['Animals', 'Blood Clot', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cannabinoids', 'Carbon', 'Chemicals', 'Cicatrix', 'Cocaine', 'Communication', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Dendrites', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dopamine', 'Dopamine Receptor', 'Electrochemistry', 'Electrodes', 'Environment', 'Fiber', 'Fourier Analysis', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Huntington Disease', 'Impairment', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Investigation', 'Iontophoresis', 'Kinetics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Noise', 'Oxygen', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Rattus', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Scanning', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tungsten', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'base', 'bone', 'brain tissue', 'capillary', 'carbon fiber', 'controlled release', 'design', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'drug of abuse', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'motor control', 'neuronal cell body', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'new technology', 'research study', 'sensor', 'tool', 'uptake']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2009,327849,0.08626344875532663

In this R21 application, we develop a new method termed vibrational photoacoustic (VPA) microscopy for 3-D vibrational imaging of tissues with a field of view and a penetration depth both in the mm scale. Our method is based on excitation of molecular overtone vibration and acoustic detection of the resultant pressure waves in the tissue. Our approach is significant in the following aspects: (i) Overtone excitation provides chemical bond selectivity and spectroscopic information in a label-free manner. (ii) Acoustic detection eliminates the tissue scattering problem encountered in near-infrared spectroscopy and enables depth-resolved signal collection in one scan. (iii) Our method provides a tissue penetration depth of a few mm, which is not accessible with existing vibrational microscopies. By excitation of the second overtone of the C-H bond stretch around 8300 cm-1, where blood interference is minimal, we have demonstrated preliminary VPA imaging of tissue phantoms and atherosclerotic plaques in arteries with a penetration depth in mm scale. These results show the great potential of developing VPA microscopy and endoscopy for label-free molecular imaging and spectroscopic analysis of lipid-related disorders in live animals and eventually in patients. The two specific aims are (1) developing high-speed VPA microscopy for in vivo molecular imaging and quantitative analysis and (2) developing VPA spectroscopy and endoscopy for in situ, depth resolved characterization of atherosclerotic plaques. Successful development of VPA microscopy should provide a new platform enabling label-free molecular imaging and spectroscopic analysis of biological specimen ex vivo and in vivo. Towards diagnosis of diseases such as atherosclerosis, VPA spectroscopy aided with principal component analysis should allow determination of lesion stages owing to the capability of identifying different pathophysiological compositions throughout deep tissues. Furthermore, our endoscopy development is expected to push the VPA method towards intravital imaging of plaques.        (provided by applicant): Intravital imaging of vulnerable plaques in cardiovascular diseases is difficult due to limited spatial resolution and/or chemical selectivity of current imaging tools. We develop a new method termed vibrational photoacoustic microscopy for 3-D vibrational imaging of tissues with a field of view and a penetration depth both in the mm scale.

"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator.  The ultimate goal of this SBIR project is to provide the DOD, DOE, and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. In Phase I, Seacoast successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a microsensor array with a proprietary trap-and- purge preconcentrator to detect chlorinated solvents, specifically TCE, and TCA, at levels low enough to meet EPA mandated levels for drinking water. In Phase II Seacoast proposes to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the system to better meet the needs identified by the Phase I consultant. The systems have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator traps the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. These sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical.  In Phase II Seacoast will specifically develop new materials to improve the sensor array selectivity, 1) by using impedance spectroscopy to study the mechanisms by which the polymer-based sensors sorb the target chemicals, 2) by implementing pattern recognition algorithms to identify chemicals for the sensor responses, and 3) by designing new preconcentrator materials that can bind these chemicals more strongly.  The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. Potential markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal describes a novel technology that specifically addresses the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations. Such a system would be used in tandem with other methods, to provide comprehensive contamination management at DOE, DOD, and Superfund sites where ground and water clean-up projects are already underway.

"AI Software for Science Education Related to Drug Abuse DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase I SBIR proposal is aimed at advancing the state of the art in chemistry education software in a critically important respect demanded by students, teachers, administrators and Quantum Simulations, Inc. customers. The focus of this innovation is the development of meaningful interactive tutoring and assessment capabilities for chemistry problem solving. Empowerment of students to make the proper decisions about drugs through experiencing the scientific process requires a solid education in basic chemistry. Chemical formulas comprise much of the fundamental ""language"" of chemistry in which students must be fluent in order to succeed. The topic of writing and understanding chemical formulas, a cornerstone of all general chemistry classes, is a reasonable starting point for the development of an AI assessment system for student learning in chemistry. A solid understanding of chemical formulas is a prerequisite to success in chemistry required not only for literacy to make informed decisions about drugs from a scientific standpoint, but also to enable and prepare students to pursue careers in research related to drug abuse. Quantum has already successfully developed and commercialized an ITS for writing chemical formulas which will be used as the starting point for the present work. The proposed technology will benefit all students; however, it is specifically targeted to help those who have the greatest need, such as students of average or marginal performance and students from historically underserved groups, by lowering barriers to accessing high-quality science instructional software.  Quantum customers include textbook publishers, software providers, hardware vendors and distance learning companies. A prominent textbook publisher, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, has entered into two long-term contracts with Quantum, resulting in rapid dissemination to an established end user base. Quantum intends to employ an identical business model to commercialize the results of this project. n/a",AI Software for Science Education Related to Drug Abuse,6831228,R43DA018455,"['adolescence (12-20)', 'artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'drug abuse education', 'educational resource design /development', 'human subject', 'science education']",NIDA,"QUANTUM SIMULATIONS, INC.",R43,2004,61750,0.026234034090422322

"Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB) Project Summary Each major human disease is associated with a specific range of morphological changes to cells and tissues in the micron scale. Normal and abnormal structure was discovered and is still characterized using histology - a microscopic technique that depends on physical tissue slices. Presently, histology’s use in systems biology is limited by its largely descriptive and two-dimensional nature. Making histology quantitative and three-dimensional would be potentially transformational for research and diagnostics, but has been impractical. Accordingly, we have now created a 3D form of histology by customizing X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) of fixed and stained, millimeter-scale, whole organisms and tissue samples. We used fixed and metal-stained, whole zebrafish because they contain a full range of tissues within the size range currently studied histologically. The result is the first practical way to create virtual histology-like “sections” in any plane. Three-dimensional, complete histological phenotyping has potential use in genetic and chemical screens, and in clinical and toxicological tissue diagnostics. Here, we propose the next steps needed to enable high-throughput, quantitative, 3D histological phenotyping of whole, millimeter-scale animals. The proposed work applies the principles of chemistry, physics, and computer science to improve image resolution, throughput, and analytics, organized into three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will build on our developments in this project and further improve imaging volume and resolution by upgrading imaging array, optics, and sub-pixel shifting, and to throughput by changes in sample embedding, loading geometry and mechanics, helical CT scanning, scintillator material, and to data sharing by improvements to the ViewTool infrastructure and user interface. Specific Aim 2 will yield reference images to define the range of normal phenotypic variation and to obtain samples related to a range of potential applications. Specific Aim 3 will apply the power of machine learning to segmentation, annotation, and analytics. Together, this work will establish a practical foundation for large-scale genetic and chemical screens involving mm-scale, whole organisms based on 3-dimensional, quantitative, histological phenotyping. The instrumentation and analytics will be state-of-the-art in its combination of resolution, field-of-view, pancellularity, image quality, analytical potential, throughput, sample stability, and reproducibility and largely usable with both tube and synchrotron X-ray sources. The voxel resolution will be at least 0.5 μm across fields-of-view of up to 1 cm. Representation of every cell type make the images suitable for cross-referencing across imaging modalities. Potential applications will be explored, “wild-type” will begin to be defined, and training sets for automated segmentation generated. The potential impact will encompass the missions of most NIH Institutes and Centers. The whole-animal genetic and chemical screens enabled are expected to impact drug development, diagnostics, and our basic understanding of how genes and environment define phenotype.

"Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We cannot yet look at a chemical structure and predict if the molecule will have an odor, much less what character it will have. The goal of the proposed research is to apply machine learning to predict perceptual characteristics from chemical features of molecules. The specific aims of the proposal will determine (1) which molecules are odorous , and (2) what data are needed to model odor character. Building a highly predictive model requires two key ingredients: high-quality data and a sound modeling approach. High-quality data must be accurate (ratings are consistent and describe true odor properties) and detailed (ratings describe even small differences in odor properties). We have collected human psychophysical data on a diverse set of molecules and have trained a model to predict if a molecule has an odor, but pilot data identified odorous contaminants that limit model training and measurement of model accuracy. In Aim 1, I will apply my background in analytical chemistry to evaluate the accuracy of the data, using gas chromatography to identify and correct errors caused by chemical contaminants. In Aim 2, I will apply my experience in human sensory evaluation to measure and compare the consistency and the degree of detail in ratings that can be achieved with different sensory methods and subject training procedures. By executing my training plan, I will develop the skills in statistical programming and machine learning needed to employ a sound modeling approach to these problems. The model constructed in Aim 1 will enable prediction of odor classification (odor/odorless) for any molecule and thus define which molecules are perceptually relevant. Predicting odor character is a far more complex challenge – while a molecule can have only one of two odor classifications (odor or odorless) it may elicit any number of diverse odor character attributes (fruity, floral, musky, sweet, etc.). Descriptive Analysis (DA) is the gold standard method for generating accurate and detailed sensory profiles, but this method is time-consuming. We estimate that an odor character dataset will be large enough (“model-ready”) to predict odor character with approximately 10,000 molecules and that it would require more than 30,000 hours of human subject evaluation, or approximately 6 years for the typical trained panel, to produce this dataset using DA. Before we invest the time and resources, it is responsible to evaluate the relative data quality of more rapid sensory methods. The results of Aim 2 are expected to determine the best approach for generating a model-ready dataset by quantifying trade-offs in degree of detail (data resolution), rating consistency, and method speed of five candidate sensory methods. Together, these aims represent a significant step forward in linking chemical recipe to human odor perception, an advancement that supports the NIDCD goal of understanding normal olfactory function (how stimulus relates to percept) and has many potential applications in foods (what composition of molecules should be present to produce a target aroma percept). PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, scientists cannot predict whether a molecule will have an odor and, if so, what odor characteristics it will have based on its chemical structure. The goal of this project is to develop predictive models linking chemical composition to odor characteristics. These models will advance our understanding of the human olfactory system and help design strategies for improving the aroma and palatability of healthy foods.",Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure,10142097,F32DC019030,"['Address', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Food', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Food', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Palate', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Programmed Learning', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysics', 'Quality Control', 'Recipe', 'Research', 'Research Technics', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'data quality', 'design', 'experience', 'food science', 'human subject', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model building', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'skills', 'sound']",NIDCD,MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER,F32,2020,67446,0.07243900491826599
"Comparative Visualization and Analysis for GCxGC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary. This project will investigate and develop effective information technologies for comparative analysis and visualization of complex data generated by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC). GCxGC is an emerging technology that provides an order-of-magnitude greater separation capacity, significantly better signal-to-noise ratio, and higher dimensional retention-structure relations than traditional GC. The principal challenge for utilization of GCxGC, in a wide range of public-health and other applications, is the difficulty of analyzing and interpreting the large, complex data it generates. The quantity and complexity of GCxGC data necessitates the investigation and development of new information technologies. This project will develop and demonstrate innovative methods and tools for comparative analysis of GCxGC datasets. The expected results of this research and development include a PCA-based method for chemical fingerprinting, decision trees with chemical constraints for sample classification, genetic programming for template and constraint-based matching and classification, and visualization methods for comparative GCxGC analyses. These methods will be implemented in commercial software that will support researchers and laboratory analysts in a wide range of commercial applications, including health care, environmental monitoring, and chemical processing. The power of GCxGC, supported by effective information technologies, will enable better understanding of chemical compositions and processes, a foundation for future scientific advances and discoveries. Relevance to Public Health. Today, a few advanced laboratories are pioneering GCxGC for a variety of applications such as environmental monitoring of exposure profiles in air, soil, food, and water; identification and quantification of toxic products in blood, urine, milk, and breath samples; and qualitative and quantitative metabolomics to provide a holistic view of the biochemical status or biochemical phenotype of an organism. Many analyses in these applications require detailed chemical comparisons of samples, e.g..monitoring changes, comparison to reference standards, chemical matching or ""fingerprinting"", and classification. GCxGC is a powerful new technology for such comparative analyses. This proposal will provide innovative information technologies to support users in these applications.           n/a",Comparative Visualization and Analysis for GCxGC,7270029,R44RR020256,"['Air', 'Archives', 'Biochemical', 'Blood', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Fingerprint', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Information Technology', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Milk', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Range', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Soil', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Today', 'Trademark', 'Urine', 'Water', 'base', 'chemical fingerprinting', 'commercial application', 'comparative', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'instrument', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'research and development', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NCRR,"GC IMAGE, LLC",R44,2007,239373,0.10552140182997237
"CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION-INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES This research will provide new, fundamental information concerning chemical communication in a primate species.  The overall long-range objective is to define the chemical nature and behavioral significance of the scent marks utilized by the South American tamarin, Saguinus fuscicollis, a member of the family Callitrichidae, in social and sexual communication.  Studies are proposed to elucidate in detail those chemical patterns which encode gender and species.  A combination of analytical techniques, pattern recognition methods and behavioral assays will identify those components or patterns of compounds, both volatile and non-volatile, which are associated with the commmunicatory information.  Bacteriological studies will determine which of the active components are of bacterial origin. In addition, a pilot study will assess the possible role of the fatty acids in encoding individual differences in the scent marks.  We anticipate that this research will lead to a much more complete understanding of the nature of the chemical code in this primate species, and in the end that it will be possible to reconstruct with synthetic formulations a variety of the communicatory signals employed by the tamarins.  To accomplish this goal, a unique interdisciplinary research team consisting of two organic chemists, a primatologist and two bacteriologists, as well as a pattern recognition expert has been assembled at the Monell Chemical Senses Center.  The proposed studies follow logically from prior work of our laboratory.

The overall, long range objectives are to define the chemical nature and behavioral significance of the scent marks utilized by the South American tamarin, Saguinus fuscicollis, a member of the marmoset family (Callitrichidae), in social and sexual communication.  The scent marks of these primates encode messages on identify of species, subspecies, and individual as well as information relating to sexual and social status.  Scent mark material, a mixture of gland secretion, some urine and possibly genital discharge, is chemically complex and includes esters, acids, alcohols, aldehydes and hydrocarbons.  To date our analytical studies using high resolution capillary gas chromatography have not revealed any qualitative differences in the scent marks of animals which differ in their sex, subspecies or species.  Therefore, we have embarked on a study to evaluate quantitative differences in the scent mark constituents.  Studies are proposed to identify the concentration profiles of the components which define gender, subspecies and species.  Analysis by computerized pattern recognition techniques will target those components which are correlated with gender, subspecies and species.  Sophisticated GC/MS/DS instrumentation will then be employed as the major tool for identification and quantitation of the targeted components.  Their role in chemical communication will be tested by behavioral assay.  Bacterial studies will also be undertaken to establish the role of microbial action in the production of some of the highly volatile components.

The overall, long range objectives are to define the chemical nature and behavioral significance of the scent marks utilized by the South American tamarin, Saguinus fuscicollis, a member of the marmoset family (Callitrichidae), in social and sexual communication.  The scent marks of these primates encode messages on identify of species, subspecies, and individual as well as information relating to sexual and social status.  Scent mark material, a mixture of gland secretion, some urine and possibly genital discharge, is chemically complex and includes esters, acids, alcohols, aldehydes and hydrocarbons.  To date our analytical studies using high resolution capillary gas chromatography have not revealed any qualitative differences in the scent marks of animals which differ in their sex, subspecies or species.  Therefore, we have embarked on a study to evaluate quantitative differences in the scent mark constituents.  Studies are proposed to identify the concentration profiles of the components which define gender, subspecies and species.  Analysis by computerized pattern recognition techniques will target those components which are correlated with gender, subspecies and species.  Sophisticated GC/MS/DS instrumentation will then be employed as the major tool for identification and quantitation of the targeted components.  Their role in chemical communication will be tested by behavioral assay.  Bacterial studies will also be undertaken to establish the role of microbial action in the production of some of the highly volatile components.  Finally, studies aimed at the identification of previously unknown components of lower volatility will be carried out.  We anticipate that this research will eventually lead to a deciphering of the chemical code such that in the end it will be possible to reconstruct with synthetic formulations the wide variety of communicatory signals employed by the tamarins.  To accomplish this goal a unique interdisciplinary research team consisting of two organic chemists, a primatologist and a bacteriologist has been assembled at the Monell Chemical Senses Center.  These studies follow logically from prior work of our laboratory.  To the best of our knowledge this research program, involving the very close collaboration of chemists, primatologists and bacteriologists to explore and define a chemical communication system in a primate species, is unique in the United States.  n/a",PRIMATE CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES,3403396,R01NS021790,"['Lepidoptera', ' analytical chemistry', ' animal communication behavior', ' artificial intelligence', ' bacteria', ' bioassay', ' ethology', ' gas chromatography', ' gas chromatography mass spectrometry', ' microorganism classification', ' olfactory stimulus', ' pheromone', ' sex', ' species difference']",NINDS,MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER,R01,1985,72512,0.12695212805785147
"Screening method to identify environmental endocrine disruptors mediated by PPARs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 80,000 chemicals are in use in the United States and over 2,000 new ones are introduced annually (NRC, 1984; OTA, 1995). While relatively few of these chemicals are likely to pose a significant risk to human health or the environment, the effects of most of them are unknown. Of particular concern, particularly in children, are those that may affect the endocrine system. The potential health significance of endocrine disruptors that act through peroxisome proliferator- activated receptors (PPARs) is receiving more attention. Many of these are found at significant levels in infants and children and have the potential of influencing metabolic disorders including obesity, diabetes, chronic inflammatory diseases and cardiovascular disease. In vitro screening tests to identify PPAR agonists currently available measure receptor binding or whole genome expression. These assays are clearly informative but the former provides no information on biological activities and the latter lacks specificity and can be difficult to translate to human health effects, having limied portability of the required technology to clinical studies and requiring intensive statistical analyses. Furthermore, PPAR responses are complex and difficult to interpret in terms of causality. PPAR-dependent responses are not only extremely diverse, but occur in both a species- and tissue-specific manner. The response can be influenced by the agonist concentration and combinations thereof as well as specific binding affinities. Given these current limitations, we propose to establish a high throughput in vitro cell culture screening assay to identify gene expression changes in key biological pathways that occur from putative environmental PPAR agonists using a low-density focused array card and selected human cell lines including HepaRG and THP1 cells, (hepatocyte and monocytes cell lines, respectively). Previous published studies and preliminary data provided here suggests that these cell lines respond to activation by PPAR agonists, reflect the biological responses that occur following human exposures and provide sufficient sensitivity indicating a high likelihood for success. The focus of this hypothesis-driven testing scheme is to identify agonists that can potentially produce health effects related to metabolic disorders such as hypercholesterolemia, obesity, type 2 diabetes and chronic inflammatory diseases. Results from these studies will help identify endocrine disruptors that have the potential to affect human health through their ability to serve as PPAR agonists. It can also be used to identify specific and potent candidate therapeutics for the treatment of metabolic disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The U.S. population is exposed to a number of environmental chemicals termed endocrine disruptors that may be associated with the increasing incidence of metabolic disorders and obesity, particularly in children. A number of these chemicals are believed to act as PPAR agonists and affect homeostatic pathways associated with carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses. The health consequences of aberrant PPAR activation are potentially significant and include obesity, type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic inflammatory diseases.            ",Screening method to identify environmental endocrine disruptors mediated by PPARs,8663276,R03ES021864,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Agonist', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical-Induced Change', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endocrine system', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Peroxisome Proliferation', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor Inhibition', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Signal Pathway', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'carbohydrate metabolism', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'density', 'environmental chemical', 'exposed human population', 'glucose metabolism', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'lipid metabolism', 'macrophage', 'member', 'monocyte', 'portability', 'protein complex', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'screening', 'success']",NIEHS,WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY,R03,2014,73260,0.036266592913382245

"Development of integrative models for early liver toxicity assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational toxicology has become a critical area of research due to the burgeoning need to evaluate thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals with unknown toxicity profiles, the high demand in time and resources by current experimental toxicity testing, and the growing ethical concerns over animal use in toxicity studies. Despite tremendous efforts, little success has been attained thus far in the development of predictive computational models for toxicity, primarily due to the complexity of toxicity mechanisms as well as the lack of high-quality experimental data for model development.  A critical challenge in toxicity testing of chemicals is that toxicity effects are doe-dependent: the true toxic hits may show no toxicity at all at low dose level. Therefore, traditiona high-throughput screening (HTS) that test chemicals only at a single concentration is not suitable for toxicity screening. On the contrary, the recently developed quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) platforms can evaluate each chemical across a broad range of concentrations, and is gaining ever-increasing popularity as a tool for in vitro toxicity profiling The concentration-response information generated by qHTS are expected to provide more accurate and comprehensive information of the toxicity effects of chemicals, offering promising data that can be mined to estimate in vivo toxicities of chemicals. However, our previous studies showed that if processed inappropriately, such concentration-response information contribute little to improve the toxicity prediction. This is especially true when multiple types of qHTS data are used together. Therefore, in this study, we will extend our previous approaches to develop novel statistical and computational tools that can curate, preprocess, and normalize the concentration-response information from multiple different qHTS databases.  Traditionally, toxicity models are based on either the chemical data (such as the quantitative structure- activity relationship analysis), or the in vitro toxicity profiling data (such as the in vitro-in vivo extrapolations). Our previous experiences suggested that integrating biological descriptors such as the in vitro cytotoxicity profiles or the short-term toxigenomic data, with chemical structural features is able to predict rodent acute liver toxicity with reasonable accuracy. Therefore, the second part of this proposal will be devoted to develop novel computational models for hepatotoxicity prediction by integrating qHTS toxicity profiles and chemical structural information In Aim 1, we will curate, preprocess, and normalize collected public liver toxicity datasets. In ths study, we will model toxicity effects using multiple large public datasets such as HTS and qHTS bioassay data (Tox21[1] and ToxCast[2]), hepatotoxicity side effect reports on marketed failed drugs[3], the Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base Benchmark Dataset (LTKB-BD[4]), etc. Statistical methods for cross-study validation and quality control will be applied to the collected datasets to ensure computational compatibility and to select the appropriate datasets for analysis. In Aim 2, we will develop predictive models for chemicals' liver toxicity based on an integrative modeling workflow that will make use of both structural and in vitro toxicity profiles of a chemical. Our previous studies [5] showed that models using both in vitro toxicity profiles and chemical structural data have better accuracy for rodent acute liver toxicity than models using either data type alone. Here, we will develop a novel modeling workflow that start with defining the functional clusters of chemicals via curated qHTS toxicity profiles, and is followed by developing computational models to correlate chemical and biological data with overall toxicity risks in humans. The predictive models will be validated using independent datasets with over 800 compounds. In Aim 3, we propose to prioritize the qHTS profiling assays used in the model for future toxicity testing. We will evaluate all the in vitro assays as biological descriptors from thee perspectives, including descriptor importance in the integrative toxicity model, correlation with i vivo DILI outcomes, and level of information content estimated by a novel approach based on network analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this study we aim to develop computational models that can identify potential liver toxicants. Liver toxicity is a significant contributor to the high attition rate in drug development. Moreover, toxic chemicals in food, water, and consumer products all pose serious risks for liver toxicity. As a result, there is great interest in developing high-throughput, high-content experimental and computational tools to evaluate the liver toxicity of thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. This study focuses on developing novel informatics tools that enable the extraction and integration of chemical concentration-response information from multiple quantitative high-throughput screening databases for model development, and developing statistical models that are able to integrate this concentration-response information with chemical structural features to predict their risk of liver toxicity.

"CHROMOSOMAL PROTEINS DURING CHEMICAL CARCINOGENESIS Administration of many chemical agents results in induction of malignant tumors in target tissues.  These malignancies are characterized by alterations in control of cellular function, suggesting that genomic alteration (mutation) and/or alterations in gene modulation have occurred.

In this continuation, we will extend our two-dimensional gel electrophoretic study of potentially critical alterations occurring in nonhistone chromosomal proteins (NHCP) and cytosolic proteins during carcinogenesis induced by diverse acting carcinogens acetylaminofluorene (AAF) and diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and in the cancers that result.  We have demonstrated that the gel system provides a highly consistent pattern of protein separation, with extreme resolution, over long periods of time.

Using these techniques, we have identified induction of tumor-associated proteins (TAP) in the total NHCP fraction as well as in the phenol-soluble fraction (phosphoproteins) of rat hepatic chromatins during AAF and DEN carcinogenesis and resulting hepatocellular carcinomas. Additionally, cytosolic AAF and DEN-TAPs have been similarly demonstrated. We will determine to what extent these changes in NHCP and cytosolic proteins characterize the general process of carcinogenesis by examining spontaneous and chemically-induced hepatic and thymus tumors in a variety of mouse inbred strains.  We will further determine the time of appearance, sub-fraction location, and in the case of NHCP, genomic distribution of TAP during chemical carcinogenesis; isolate these proteins, and produce monoclonal antibodies for use in their study, as well as determining their functional significance.  Lastly, we will continue our technological developments to assure maximum detection, and computer-assisted image-processing of the complex protein patterns that characterize normal and malignant cells in order to confirm and further detect potential hallmark proteins, whose occurrence mark malignant induction.  n/a",CHROMOSOMAL PROTEINS DURING CHEMICAL CARCINOGENESIS,3168057,R01CA028263,"['acetylaminofluorene', ' artificial intelligence', ' autoradiography', ' chemical carcinogenesis', ' chromatin', ' chromosomes', ' electrofocusing', ' gel electrophoresis', ' genetic markers', ' liver neoplasms', ' monoclonal antibody', ' neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' nitrosamines', ' radiotracer', ' thymus neoplasms']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,1986,108862,0.026266885592680856

"MASS SPECTROMETRY IN ORGANIC AND BIOCHEMISTRY The application of various mass spectrometric techniques to structure elucidation of three classes of biologically important natural products will be studied.  The first group encompasses novel marine sterols, which differ primarily from terrestrial sterols in the nature of their unusual (elongated or branched) side chains.  This feature appears to be of importance in cell membrane function and a detailed knowledge of the mass spectral fragmentation pattern of such sterol types is needed for structural elucidation of novel and as yet unidentified sterols of marine organisms.  Much of this work requires synthesis of requisite sterol reference compounds or synthetic verification of postulated structure.  The second group of natural products deals with the unusual phospholipids isolated from marine organisms.  Much less is known about the mass spectrometric behavior of this biologically important class of natural products as compared to sterols, and we intend to explore this field in detail by comparing different ionization techniques (electron impact vs. field desorption vs. chemical ionization vs. fast atom bombardment) since each is likely to provide special structural information on specific portions of the phospholipid molecule.  Since the novel marine phospholipids are particularly unusual in the context of their unprecedented fatty acid components (usually polyunsaturated), work is also envisaged on the mass spectrometric location of such double bonds in long-chain fatty acids.  Finally, we intend to develop mass spectral procedures (notably through the use of chemical ionization mass spectrometry with hydrogen gas) in the porphyrin field with the aim of accomplishing an as yet largely unrealized goal, namely the location of chemical substituents in the four different pyrrole rings of the prophyrin molecule solely through the use of mass spectrometry.

"Using machine learning techniques to characterize the Metabolomics Workbench Dataset PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Mass spectrometry in combination with chromatography provides a powerful approach to characterize small molecules produced in cells, tissues and other biological systems. In essence, measured metabolites provide a functional readout of cellular state, allowing novel biological studies that advance our understanding of health and disease. Currently, the main bottleneck in metabolomics is determining the chemical identities associated with the spectral signatures of measured masses. Despite the growth of spectral databases and advances in annotation tools that recommend the chemical structure that best explains each signature, the large majority of measured masses cannot be assigned a chemical identity. There is now consensus that gleaning partial information regarding the measured spectra in terms of chemical substructure or chemical classification can inform biological studies. This consensus is reflected in the newly updated reporting standards for metabolite annotation as proposed by the Metabolite Identification Task Group of the Metabolomics Society. As we show in our Preliminary Results, spectral characterization results in “features” that can enhance performance in machine-learning tasks such as annotation.  This work aims to enhance the use and value of the metabolomics dataset in Metabolomics Workbench by: (1) developing machine-learning tools trained on this dataset to characterize unknown spectra, and (2) adding characterization information to the Metabolomics Workbench dataset. In Aim 1, we identify spectral patterns (motifs) that can represent chemically meaningful groupings of peaks within the spectra (e.g., peaks associated with aromatic substructures, loss of a substructure fragment, etc.). We utilize neural topic models that use variational inference to identify such motifs. We expect such models to offer computational speedups and to identify more chemically coherent motifs when compared to earlier implementations of topic modeling. We generate motifs across all spectra in the Metabolomics Workbench and provide annotations for each spectrum.  In Aim 2, we map spectral signatures to chemical ontology classes. As ontologies are hierarchical and as a molecule can be associated with multiple classes at different hierarchical levels of an ontology, we cast this mapping problem as a hierarchical multi-label classification problem and use neural networks to implement such a classifier. The classifier will be trained using the Metabolomics Workbench dataset. Learned motifs from Aim 1 will be used as additional input features to improve classification. We expect that the developed classifier can be used by others to elucidate measurements of unidentified molecules with chemical ontology classes, or to generate ontology terms that can be used as features in downstream machine-learning tasks. Relevance to Public Health The project proposes to investigate machine learning techniques to enhance the utility of a Common Fund data set hosted through the Metabolomics Workbench. This data set consists of biologically relevant molecules and information about their structural composition and their mass spectrometry signatures.

"Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Experimental animal and clinical testing to evaluate hepatotoxicity demands extensive resources and long turnaround times. Utilization of computational models to directly predict the toxicity of new compounds is a promising strategy to reduce the cost of drug development and to screen the multitude of industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants currently lacking safety assessments. However, the current computational models for complex toxicity endpoints, such as hepatotoxicity, are not reliable for screening new compounds and face numerous challenges. Our recent studies have shown that traditional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship modeling is applicable for relatively simple properties or toxicity endpoints with a clear mechanism, but fails to address complex bioactivities such as hepatotoxicity. The primary objective of this proposal is to develop novel mechanism-driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway (vAOP) models for the fast and accurate assessment of hepatotoxicity in a high-throughput manner The resulting vAOP models will be experimentally validated using a complement of in vitro and ex vivo testing. We have generated a preliminary vAOP model based on the antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway that has undergone initial validation and refinement using in vitro testing. To this end, our project will generate novel predictive models for hepatotoxicity by applying 1) a virtual cellular stress pathway model to mechanism profiling and assessment of new compounds; 2) computational predictions to fill in the missing data for specific targets within the pathway; 3) in vitro experimental validation with three complementary bioassays; and 4) ex vivo experimental validation with pooled primary human hepatocytes capable of biochemical transformation. The scientific approach of this study is to develop a universal modeling workflow that can take advantage of all available short-term testing information, obtained from both computational predictions using novel machine learning approaches and in vitro experiments, for target compounds of interest. We will validate and use our modeling workflow to directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity of new compounds and prioritize candidates for validation in pooled primary human hepatocytes. The resulting workflow will be disseminated via a web portal for public users around the world with internet access. Importantly, this study will pave the way for the next generation of chemical toxicity assessment by reconstructing the modeling process through a combination of big data, computational modeling, and low cost in vitro experiments. To the best of our knowledge, the implementation of this project will lead to the first publicly available mechanisms-driven modeling and web- based prediction framework for complex chemical toxicity based on publicly-accessible big data. These deliverables will have a significant public health impact by not only prioritizing compounds for safety testing or new chemical development, but also revealing toxicity mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatotoxicity is a leading safety concern in the development of new chemicals. We will create virtual “Adverse Outcome Pathway” models that will directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity potentials of chemicals using massive public toxicity data. The primary deliverable of this project will be a publically-accessible, web-based search engine to evaluate new chemicals for risk of hepatotoxicity.",Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity,9864299,R01ES031080,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Antioxidants', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Stress', 'Chemical Injury', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cryopreservation', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug Costs', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Liver', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nutraceutical', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'PubChem', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Response Elements', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statutes and Laws', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Vertebrates', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'candidate validation', 'cell injury', 'combat', 'computational toxicology', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data mining', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'developmental toxicity', 'drug development', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'experimental study', 'hepatocellular injury', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'liver injury', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'reproductive toxicity', 'research clinical testing', 'safety assessment', 'safety testing', 'screening', 'search engine', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web portal']",NIEHS,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ CAMDEN,R01,2020,465692,0.06185748255774637
"Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity PROJECT SUMMARY  Wildfire occurrence, duration, and intensity have heightened in recent decades and continue to impact the health of millions of individuals worldwide. Smoke that is emitted from wildfires consists of a complex mixture of particulate matter and toxic gases. The chemical composition of wildfire smoke is dependent upon the type of biomass burn conditions and fuel type, which are heavily influenced by geographical region. The chemical mixtures within wildfire smoke that humans are exposed to can consequently cause variable health outcomes through potentially different biological mechanisms. Human exposure to wildfire smoke represents a growing concern in public health, and adequately characterizing health risks associated with biomass smoke across varying burn conditions and geographic areas is not possible with the data currently available.  The variabilities in toxicological responses across wildfire smoke exposure conditions have yet to be fully established and evaluated in the context of chemical composition. The growing threat of wildfires necessitates the elucidation of individual and/or co-occurring components of wildfire smoke that act as the primary drivers of toxicity. To address this important research issue, we expand upon a foundational study that has previously characterized the chemical constituents in various biomass burn scenarios and evaluated, in part, toxicological responses to these exposures in the mouse lung. Here, we leverage this extensive database and banked samples to: 1. characterize in vivo transcriptomic responses and pathway alterations associated with biomass smoke in the mouse lung; 2. integrate chemical-toxicity profiles using computational approaches to prioritize chemicals that are likely driving toxicity responses; and 3. further evaluate chemical drivers of biomass smoke toxicity responses using in vitro approaches.  This research will be carried out through a collaboration with laboratories at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, allowing for a unique combination of expertise for studying the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity. This expertise includes skills in computational toxicology, exposure science, and molecular biology, coupled with experience studying adverse health effects and immune responses induced by exposure to air pollutants. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exposure to wildfire smoke continues to be a growing threat to public health, yet the primary drivers of toxicity and disease are not completely understood. This proposal represents an innovative approach to increase understanding on the health effects of wildfires by leveraging a robust dataset of chemical-biological profiles from mice exposed to biomass smoke condensate samples derived from variable conditions. New data will also be generated alongside additional in vitro testing to more comprehensively examine mechanisms of toxicity and identify the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity, resulting in improved abilities to predict region- specific health risks attributable to wildfires.",Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity,9956440,R21ES031740,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemically Induced Toxicity', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gases', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inhalation', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mus', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Smoke', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Wildfire', 'asthma exacerbation', 'base', 'biomass fuel', 'biomass smoke', 'computational toxicology', 'data integration', 'data reduction', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'exposed human population', 'genotoxicity', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'male', 'novel', 'protein biomarkers', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'smoke inhalation', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2020,227277,-0.011263635588749456
"CRYPTOCOCCUS NEOFORMANS--EPITOPE ANTIBODIES & STRUCTURE Cryptococcus neoformans in a pathogenic yeast that causes life-                  threatening meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients.                   The incidence of crytococcosis has increased dramatically in                     recent years as a consequence of the AIDS epidemic. The major                    capsular polysaccharide, glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), is                           serotype determinant of these organisms.  The capsular                           polysaccharides are important contributors to the virulence of C.                Neoformans. GXM is antiphagocytic and poorly immunogenic.

"Development of a web-based platform implementing novel Predictor of Skin Sensitization for Medical Devices (PreSS/MD) PROJECT SUMMARY Medical devices have been documented to contain toxic chemicals that can leach and cause acute contact dermatitis (ACD) after repeated exposure or prolonged contact of the skin to these toxins. ACD is credited for 10-15% of all occupational illnesses and is also the second highest reported occupational hazard. Given its prevalence, ACD is also a great public health burden with combined yearly costs of up to $1 billion, which spans including medical costs, worker’s compensation and lost working time due to workplace absence. To this end, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has mandated that all medical devices must be evaluated for possible skin sensitization using in vivo animal assays, which includes the Guinea pig maximization test (GPMT). Although GPMT tests provide valuable data on the skin sensitization effects of potential toxins, these assays are time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) recently published a Strategic Roadmap, calling for the development of alternative approaches to reduce animal testing of chemical and medical agents. Thus, there is a stated need to modernize safety evaluation of medical devices to reduce animal testing and shorten the regulatory review time, which would ultimately bring safer devices to the market faster. To address this unmet need, the key objectives of our FDA Phase I SBIR project are to (i) produce rigorously validated computational models for the GPMT assay integrating data obtained in human, mouse, and in vitro assays; and (ii) integrate these models into a software product termed PreSS/MD (Predictor of Skin Sensitization for Medical Devices). Our specific aims for this study include: 1) collecting, curating, and integrating the largest publicly available dataset for GMPT; 2) creating and validating novel computational models for GMPT data; 3) developing the PreSS/MD web server to allow users to make predictions of skin sensitization potential in medical devices. We will also develop a model for mixtures, including compounds tested jointly in different concentrations, using an approach that we developed previously. Finally, we will implement novel approaches to help users of our PreSS/MD platform interpret the developed models in terms of key chemical features responsible for skin sensitization. In addition, we will employ biomedical knowledge graphs to elucidate Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) for skin sensitizers. Successful execution of this Phase I project will yield in the development of PreSS/MD as a centralized resource to evaluate the skin sensitization potential for medical devices. We expect this software-as-a-service web server platform will be of great value for companies and sponsors seeking regulatory approval of medical devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given that medical devices have been documented to contain toxic chemicals that may lead to allergic contact dermatitis, the US Food and Drug Administration requires that all devices be evaluated for possible skin sensitization effects using in vivo assays such as the Guinea pig maximization test. In the effort to modernize skin sensitization safety evaluation methods to reduce in vivo animal testing, herein we propose to develop a software product, PreSS/-MD (Predictor of Skin Sensitization caused by Medical Devices), as an innovative and unique in silico alternative with the potential to better predict human response compared to the existing approaches for skin sensitization assessment. Successful execution of the objectives described in this project will result in a centralized web server platform to evaluate the skin sensitization potential for medical devices, which will be of significant value for companies and sponsors seeking regulatory approval of medical devices.",Development of a web-based platform implementing novel Predictor of Skin Sensitization for Medical Devices (PreSS/MD),10079701,R43ES032371,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Allergic Contact Dermatitis', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Assay', 'Cavia', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Contact Dermatitis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Instruction', 'Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Occupational', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Poison', 'Prevalence', 'Prostheses and Implants', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Skin', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxin', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'Workers&apos', ' Compensation', 'Workplace', 'adverse outcome', 'chemical release', 'cost', 'experience', 'in silico', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'knowledge graph', 'lymph nodes', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'occupational hazard', 'operation', 'phase 1 study', 'response', 'skin patch', 'software as a service', 'success', 'systemic toxicity', 'tool', 'web portal', 'web server']",NIEHS,"PREDICTIVE, LLC",R43,2020,167910,0.0426083201684544
"Vibrational Photoacoustic Microscopy for Bond-selective Tissue Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A long term goal of our research is pursuing new understanding of molecular functions in health and disease via development of label-free microscopy. In this R21 application, we develop a new method termed vibrational photoacoustic (VPA) microscopy for 3-D vibrational imaging of tissues with a field of view and a penetration depth both in the mm scale. Our method is based on excitation of molecular overtone vibration and acoustic detection of the resultant pressure waves in the tissue. Our approach is significant in the following aspects: (i) Overtone excitation provides chemical bond selectivity and spectroscopic information in a label-free manner. (ii) Acoustic detection eliminates the tissue scattering problem encountered in near-infrared spectroscopy and enables depth-resolved signal collection in one scan. (iii) Our method provides a tissue penetration depth of a few mm, which is not accessible with existing vibrational microscopies. By excitation of the second overtone of the C-H bond stretch around 8300 cm-1, where blood interference is minimal, we have demonstrated preliminary VPA imaging of tissue phantoms and atherosclerotic plaques in arteries with a penetration depth in mm scale. These results show the great potential of developing VPA microscopy and endoscopy for label-free molecular imaging and spectroscopic analysis of lipid-related disorders in live animals and eventually in patients. The two specific aims are (1) developing high-speed VPA microscopy for in vivo molecular imaging and quantitative analysis and (2) developing VPA spectroscopy and endoscopy for in situ, depth resolved characterization of atherosclerotic plaques. Successful development of VPA microscopy should provide a new platform enabling label-free molecular imaging and spectroscopic analysis of biological specimen ex vivo and in vivo. Towards diagnosis of diseases such as atherosclerosis, VPA spectroscopy aided with principal component analysis should allow determination of lesion stages owing to the capability of identifying different pathophysiological compositions throughout deep tissues. Furthermore, our endoscopy development is expected to push the VPA method towards intravital imaging of plaques.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: (provided by applicant): Intravital imaging of vulnerable plaques in cardiovascular diseases is difficult due to limited spatial resolution and/or chemical selectivity of current imaging tools.

"Systematic data curation and integration to link models of human disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decades of experiments have produced vast amounts of data and identified a multitude of molecular processes that underlie specific biological functions directly relevant to human health. However, the potential of these data to inform about human health and disease have not yet been fully realized because publications report results in natural language that is not easily identifiable or computable. To capture and interrogate this wealth of data from the literature, we developed the BioGRID, an open repository for molecular interactions. BioGRID is a widely used resource, with on average over 6,500 unique visitors per month who explore the > 360,000 interactions in the database with custom search and visualization tools. In addition, BioGRID data sets are the source of interaction information for a host of partner databases. An analogous challenge exists with the description of models of human disease. While much information is available from years of research in powerful models of human disease, including yeast, nematode, fly, zebrafish and mouse models, the relationship of these models to each other and to human disease has not been systematically organized. In this and other proposals connected through the Linking Animal Models to Human Disease Initiative (LAMHDl), we will undertake a systematic, coordinated effort to expand the BioGRID database through curation of pivotal new data compendia, application of sophisticated new methods for data integration, organization of data into predicted networks, and critically, linkage of networks between model systems and human disease processes. Our curation effort will comprehensively annotate RNAi phenotype data and chemical genetic data, which are crucial for accurate models of human disease and therapeutic intervention in disease, respectively. We will apply data analysis techniques to integrate these and other data across species to link human diseases with all relevant models to predict new features of human disease. We will also develop software tools to allow facile access of the research community to all of these results. Thus, we will enable the biomedical community to access fully comprehensive, integrated datasets across multiple models for hypothesis generation and analysis of human diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): We will collect a unique and extensive set of protein and gene interactions from models that are relevant to human disease, as well as their interactions with chemicals (drugs) and their effect on specific functions.

"Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of mammary gland exposure-response relationships to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) Project Abstract  Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a family of over 5000 man-made chemicals that are ubiquitous in the environment, due to their chemical stability and bioaccumulative properties. Many of these “forever chemicals” have been linked with health concerns, including strong evidence of developmental health and harm to hormone-sensitive tissues. Manufacturers continue to substitute new PFAS for which exposure- based health risks are unknown. There is an urgent public health need to determine the effects of PFAS in use on both mammary gland development and increased breast cancer incidence. Current exposure studies use rodent models that require cumbersome end-point analyses as well as large monetary and time investments.  Our proposal is aimed at developing an in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) pipeline of mammary gland development and maintenance to identify and prioritize potentially toxic PFAS, to ultimately mitigate number of animals needed for environmental exposure studies. Our approach is to develop in vitro models of the mammary gland of increasing complexity but decreasing throughput, identifying links between high-throughput and high- complexity model endpoint readouts to best prioritize large chemical libraries. A key technology to establish links across multiple in vitro culture platforms is optical coherence tomography-based structural-functional imaging (OCT-SFI), developed by MPI Oldenburg, which non-invasively visualizes label-free cells, their intracellular motility, and morphology of formed spheroids, within optically turbid tissue models.  Our first specific aim advances a high-throughput paper-based culture system, developed by MPI Lockett, to study mammary epithelial cell invasion in physiologically relevant tissue microenvironments. The platform will evaluate 96 different exposure conditions in parallel. Our second specific aim employs 3D co-culture models that include fibroblasts to model stromal signaling known to affect mammary gland development. OCT-SFI will provide cellular motility and morphology of the organotypic spheroids that form in these cultures. Finally, our third aim will screen a library of 40 PFAS, with a particular focus on the perfluoroethercarboxylic acids (PFECAs) currently used in industrial coatings. In addition, 12 PFAS will be screened for which there is existing in vivo rodent model data available, and comparisons between in vitro assay outputs and in vivo gland remodeling will be used to refine the assay models and establish initial thresholds for screening.  The models developed as part of this proposal will thus be predictive of biology, enabling the high-throughput capability needed for future screening of all PFAS as well as other emerging endocrine disruptors. The project’s risk is balanced by the known imaging capabilities of OCT-SFI to probe responses in 3D spheroid and paper- based co-cultures. The high-throughput nature of this IVIVE pipeline makes it ideal for screening libraries of potential toxicants, providing information-rich datasets of spatially and temporally resolved morphological and molecular changes across the tissue-like structures. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a pipeline to screen and prioritize libraries of potentially toxic man-made chemicals found in the environment for further analyses, with particular emphasis on per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) of which there are over 5000 currently known. Current environmental exposure testing methods evaluate mammary gland development in live mice because the mammary gland is highly susceptible to chemical exposure; yet, such methods are slow and expensive. Our proposal uses mammary cell culture models in increasingly complex, tissue-like environments, in combination with high-speed 3D optical imaging techniques, and ultimately compare the platform with a few candidate PFAS against existing data in live mice, setting the stage for future high-throughput screening of potential environmental toxicants.",Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of mammary gland exposure-response relationships to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),10152786,R01ES032730,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Breast Cancer Epidemiology', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Fibroblasts', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gland', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hormones', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Investments', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary gland', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Mesenchymal', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nature', 'North Carolina', 'Odds Ratio', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Physiological', 'Poly-fluoroalkyl substances', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'S-Phase Fraction', 'Scanning', 'Scoring Method', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'assay development', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'carcinogenicity', 'cell motility', 'chemical stability', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging capabilities', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'intercellular communication', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant phenotype', 'mammary epithelium', 'mammary gland development', 'man', 'model design', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'premalignant', 'protein biomarkers', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,559511,0.015777934113438384

"2D NMR SPECTRA, IMAG. RECONSTRUCTION AND PATTERN RECOG.

"Identification of Neurochemical Antecedents and Consequences of Distinct Learning Processes Relevant to Addiction Liability ABSTRACT Cues or stimuli in the environment can guide behavior in adaptive ways, bringing one in close proximity to valuable resources (i.e. food, water, mates); but they can also elicit maladaptive behavior. For example, in addicts, exposure to cues (e.g. places, paraphernalia) previously associated with drug-taking often leads to relapse, despite the desire to remain abstinent. The ability of such cues to elicit complex emotional and motivational states and gain control over one's behavior occurs via Pavlovian learning mechanisms. Using an animal model that captures individual differences in response to reward cues, we can now study the neural processes underlying aberrant forms of cue-reward learning, bringing us closer to identifying novel targets for the treatment of addiction. When rats are exposed to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm wherein a discrete cue is repeatedly paired with presentation of a reward, some are “sign-trackers”—those that attribute incentive salience to the cue, and others “goal-trackers”—those that assign only predictive value to the cue. Thus, there is individual variation in the extent to which food cues are attributed with Pavlovian incentive motivational value (“incentive salience”), and this variation predicts the degree to which drug cues will attain control over behavior and the propensity to relapse. Furthermore, this animal model allows us to parse the incentive from the predictive properties of reward cues, and we have used it to demonstrate that distinct neural circuits regulate these different forms of cue-reward learning. In addition, we have shown that dopamine is critical for incentive learning (i.e. sign-tracking), but not predictive learning (i.e. goal-tracking). Most studies to-date, however, have been hampered by the inability to measure neural correlates of these phenotypes prior to learning. That is, rats must first undergo Pavlovian conditioning in order to be characterized as sign- or goal-trackers. Thus, the first Aim of the current proposal is to determine whether there are pre-existing basal differences in neurotransmitter signaling in the nucleus accumbens core that predict those individuals prone to attribute incentive salience to reward cues prior to behavioral testing. To do this, we will use a novel chemical analytical approach (stable-isotope labeling) that will allow us, for the first time, to assess true basal levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA in sign- and goal-trackers. The second Aim will use another novel, but different, chemical analytical approach to simultaneously assess up to 50 neurochemicals in the nucleus accumbens core in sign- and goal-trackers. The focus of the second Aim will be on the neurochemical profiles that emerge as a consequence of an individual's associative learning style. Advanced statistical analyses will be applied in order to identify neurochemical profiles that best predict the behavioral phenotypes and to examine the relationship between neurochemicals over the course of learning. This work will highlight specific neural systems that may render an individual more susceptible to control by reward cues and lay the foundation for future studies to identify novel neuromolecular targets for the treatment of addiction. PROJECT NARRATIVE The way an individual responds to cues associated with rewards may be a key determinant of vulnerability to addiction and relapse. We will employ novel analytical approaches to uncover neurochemical signatures associated with individual variation in response to reward cues. These studies will identify pre-existing and experience-dependent neural mechanisms that allow cues in the environment to gain inordinate control over behavior, and could lead to novel targets for the treatment of addiction.",Identification of Neurochemical Antecedents and Consequences of Distinct Learning Processes Relevant to Addiction Liability,9716629,R21DA045146,"['Acetylcholine', 'Address', 'Algorithm Design', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorides', 'Complex', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'High Pressure Liquid Chromatography', 'Impulsivity', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microdialysis', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motivation', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome Measure', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'behavior test', 'classical conditioning', 'drug seeking behavior', 'executive function', 'experience', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'incentive salience', 'individual variation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motivated behavior', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurochemistry', 'neuromechanism', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'reinforcer', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sample collection', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2019,233699,0.03534364359734129

Advanced statistical analyses will be applied in order to identify neurochemical profiles that best predict the behavioral phenotypes and to examine the relationship between neurochemicals over the course of learning. This work will highlight specific neural systems that may render an individual more susceptible to control by reward cues and lay the foundation for future studies to identify novel neuromolecular targets for the treatment of addiction. PROJECT NARRATIVE The way an individual responds to cues associated with rewards may be a key determinant of vulnerability to addiction and relapse. We will employ novel analytical approaches to uncover neurochemical signatures associated with individual variation in response to reward cues. These studies will identify pre-existing and experience-dependent neural mechanisms that allow cues in the environment to gain inordinate control over behavior, and could lead to novel targets for the treatment of addiction.",Identification of Neurochemical Antecedents and Consequences of Distinct Learning Processes Relevant to Addiction Liability,9527977,R21DA045146,"['Acetylcholine', 'Address', 'Algorithm Design', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorides', 'Complex', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'High Pressure Liquid Chromatography', 'Impulsivity', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microdialysis', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motivation', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome Measure', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'behavior test', 'classical conditioning', 'drug seeking behavior', 'executive function', 'experience', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'incentive salience', 'individual variation', 'learning strategy', 'motivated behavior', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurochemistry', 'neuromechanism', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'reinforcer', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sample collection', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2018,208699,0.03534364359734129
"KNOWLEDGE-BASED CHEMICAL SYMBOL RECOGNITION SYSTEM The ultimate goal of this project is to develop and commercialize a functional, low-cost system for machine reading and recognition of chemical structure diagrams.  The specific Phase I goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing such a system using a knowledge-based approach which provides a logical method for expanding the chemical symbol recognition domain and for handling exceptions to recognition rules.  Prior work on system design, algorithm development and literature research supports our contention that developing a useable chemical reader is feasible.  the chemical reader will find application as an intelligent input device for entry of chemical structure data into chemical information systems.  Yearly, thousands of structures must be entered into large databases by specially trained persons.  In addition, searches of these databases by chemistry researchers often require input of structural information.  The chemical reader will enable entry of structural information via universally recognized diagrams instead of using system specific codes.  In this proposal we describe a knowledge- based approach to developing the chemical reader.  This approach has been successfully used by others in systems designed to recognize line drawings.  In the chemical reader system a knowledge base will be built which contains rules incorporating knowledge of chemistry and diagramming conventions.  The rules will use facts obtained from feature extractors operating on pattern primitives derived from 2D gray level images of structure diagrams.  the images can be acquired using either optical scanners or CCD camera/frame grabber devices.  The result of processing the structure diagram will be a connection table, the standard representation for chemical structures.  n/a",KNOWLEDGE-BASED CHEMICAL SYMBOL RECOGNITION SYSTEM,3498720,R43GM047173,"['artificial intelligence', ' chemical information system', ' chemical structure', ' computer graphics /printing', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' information retrieval']",NIGMS,"WESTERN RESEARCH COMPANY, INC.",R43,1993,50000,0.19388814904539015
"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems. All of these studies will be carried out in collaboration with leading experimentalists, while continuing to add a new dimension to the field of biomolecular computer simulation as a whole. 1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  In this project, computer simulations will be used to study proton transport in several important biomolecular systems. Proton translocation is of fundamental significance throughout biology, as demonstrated by the pH-dependence of biomolecular structure and function and the central role of transmembrane proton gradients in bioenergy conversion. Moreover, understanding proton transport is of fundamental importance and direct relevance to numerous aspects of human health, including metabolism, aging, diabetes, neurodegeneration, retinal degeneration, antivral and anti-bacterial therapeutics, and homeostasis. 1",Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules,9934213,R01GM053148,"['ATP Synthesis Pathway', 'Achievement', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Amino Acids', 'Anions', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Entropy', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Inorganic Phosphate Transporter', 'Ion Transport', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oligopeptides', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proton Pump', 'Protons', 'Publishing', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transport Process', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus Diseases', 'Water', 'Wisconsin', 'anti-influenza drug', 'antiporter', 'chemical bond', 'chemical reaction', 'experimental study', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'kinetic model', 'migration', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'multi drug transporter', 'novel', 'pH gradient', 'protonation', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'symporter', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2020,310328,0.03986273778278472

"Mechanism of Dioxygen Reduction by Heme-Copper Oxidases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of this research is to elucidate the mechanism of electron and proton transfer during the reduction of dioxygen to water by heme-copper oxidases. Our specific aims will focus on 4 problems: 1. The mechanism of the reduction of dioxygen to water by wild-type and mutant bacterial heme-copper oxidases will be studied by the CO flow-flash method. Time-resolved multichannel optical absorption spectroscopy, in conjunction with singular value decomposition (SVD) and global exponential fitting analysis, will be used to follow the kinetics of electron and proton transfer and to deduce the UV-Vis spectra of the transient intermediates. These studies should provide new insight into the mechanism of the dioxygen reduction reaction by heme-copper oxidases. 2. The intramolecular electron transfer in the bacterial oxidases, bo3 from E. coli, aa3 from Rhodobacter sphaeroides and ba3 from Thermus thermophilus, will be investigated using a photoactivatable dye, thiouredopyrenetrisulfonate (TUPS), covalently linked to single reactive cysteine residues on the oxidases. Time-resolved optical absorption spectroscopy will be used to determine the spectra of the intermediates. By varying the distance between the labeled cysteine and the initial electron acceptor and by introducing breaks into presumed electron transfer pathways by site-directed mutagenesis, detailed information regarding intramolecular electron transfer pathways in heme-copper oxidases will be obtained. 3. We will synthesize chemical analogs of the active site of cytochrome oxidase, including the cyclic pentapeptide (His-Pro-Glu-Val-Tyr) with and without Cu-ligands incorporated. The analogs will be studied using steady-state and time-resolved UV-Vis spectroscopy, FTIR and EPR, which will provide insight into the role of the cross-link in cytochrome oxidase function. 4. Nitric oxide (NO) has emerged as an important biological regulatory agent. A new direction in our research is to understand how NO interacts with heme-copper oxidases. The photodissociation dynamics of ruthenium nitrosyl complexes and the reaction of the photoproduced NO with heme-copper oxidases and their turnover intermediates will be investigated using time-resolved multichannel optical absorption spectroscopy.

Our specific aims will focus on 4 problems: 1. The mechanism of the reduction of dioxygen to water by wild-type and mutant bacterial heme-copper oxidases will be studied by the CO flow-flash method. Time-resolved multichannel optical absorption spectroscopy, in conjunction with singular value decomposition (SVD) and global exponential fitting analysis, will be used to follow the kinetics of electron and proton transfer and to deduce the UV-Vis spectra of the transient intermediates. These studies should provide new insight into the mechanism of the dioxygen reduction reaction by heme-copper oxidases. 2. The intramolecular electron transfer in the bacterial oxidases, bo3 from E. coli, aa3 from Rhodobacter sphaeroides and ba3 from Thermus thermophilus, will be investigated using a photoactivatable dye, thiouredopyrenetrisulfonate (TUPS), covalently linked to single reactive cysteine residues on the oxidases. Time-resolved optical absorption spectroscopy will be used to determine the spectra of the intermediates. By varying the distance between the labeled cysteine and the initial electron acceptor and by introducing breaks into presumed electron transfer pathways by site-directed mutagenesis, detailed information regarding intramolecular electron transfer pathways in heme-copper oxidases will be obtained. 3. We will synthesize chemical analogs of the active site of cytochrome oxidase, including the cyclic pentapeptide (His-Pro-Glu-Val-Tyr) with and without Cu-ligands incorporated. The analogs will be studied using steady-state and time-resolved UV-Vis spectroscopy, FTIR and EPR, which will provide insight into the role of the cross-link in cytochrome oxidase function. 4.

"NEURAL SYSTEMS THAT EXTRACT INFORMATION FROM DATABASES The intent of this project is to develop a method of automatically programming neural-networks to extract needed information from databases of biological and chemical information.  The specific application example we will pursue in Phase I will be the creation of a framework for training a neural network to predict the toxic and carcinogenic properties of chemicals using data stored in the Organ Toxicity Database.  The neural network will be trained to recognize patterns and correlations between chemical structure/substructures, physiochemical properties, and toxicologic/carcinogenic findings stored in the electronic compilation of a large subset of NTP TR and NTP TOX documents.  A system which automatically selects the pertinent data fields for accurately predicting toxicity and then trains a neural network will be developed.  The ability of the resulting neural network to predict the carcinogenic and toxic properties of known liver and kidney toxicants and carcinogens will be evaluated during Phase I. If accurate prediction is achieved, we will build a generalized framework for extending our techniques to other types of biological and chemical databases during Phase II.  The value of many databases will be greatly increased by the availability of methods to automatically create neural networks which extract needed information for various applications.  For example, our toxicity prediction system would reduce the exposure of the general public to possibly hazardous chemicals, would allow chemical manufacturers to quickly determine the hazards of new and existing products, and would same enormous amounts of time and money currently spent on animal testing.  Each application developed using our framework could offer similar benefits.  n/a",NEURAL SYSTEMS THAT EXTRACT INFORMATION FROM DATABASES,2104250,R43CA062795,"['artificial intelligence', ' chemical carcinogen', ' chemical information system', ' chemical structure function', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' information retrieval', ' information system analysis', ' method development', ' toxicology information system']",NCI,NOVEL PHARMACEUTICALS,R43,1994,80768,0.12192100788663512
"Improving Quantum Chemistry Calculations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the functionality of our commercial quantum chemistry program, Q-Chem, to effectively treat molecules containing transition metals. This enhanced capability will provide Q-Chem's end-users with the ability to accurately model complex molecules such as proteins, enzymes, and catalysts of industrial importance. While remarkable progress has been made over the last several years in the accurate modeling of systems containing transition metals, current numerical methods for achieving SCF convergence in these systems are problematic at best, resulting in long execution times or, in some cases, complete failure to find a solution. However, a novel computational technique developed at Q-Chem has been shown to dramatically improve convergence for organic molecules with known SCF convergence problems. We propose to adapt this method for use with transition metals. Our goal is to achieve the same robust SCF convergence that is realized for most organic molecules, thereby greatly increasing productivity and extending the capability of scientists to study molecules such as enzymes and industrial catalysts. During Phase (I, our efforts will be to further extend Q-Chem's capability in the molecular biology arena. This proposal seeks to improve the quantum chemical treatment of molecular systems containing transition metals. Transition metal elements are essential to natural biological processes. The technology developed in this research will enable the computer modeling of those systems that are difficult to handle with the current methodologies and therefore increase of the applications of computational modeling. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Transition-metal elements play a vital role in biological systems.  The success of this project will improve the performance of modeling of transition-metal complexes and making the modelings possible for the systems that current algorithms fail.  The resulting work will be made available to researchers in health industry and universities through our commercial software Q-Chem. n/a",Improving Quantum Chemistry Calculations,6484828,R43GM065617,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' heavy metals', ' mathematical model', ' mathematics', ' model design /development', ' quantum chemistry']",NIGMS,"Q-CHEM, INC.",R43,2002,109642,0.015309069989443142
"Predictive QSAR Modeling DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main objective of this project is to develop, validate, and deliver efficient computational tools for rapid and reliable prediction of biological activity and/or related pharmaceutical properties of drug-like molecules. We plan to develop statistically significant and robust Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) methodologies, which incorporate rigorous validation procedures and lead to models with a high predictive power and practical utility. The methodologies are built upon the similarity principle, i.e., similarity or diversity of chemical structures determines similarity or diversity of their biological action. We argue that chemical similarity should be evaluated in the context of the target property and employ objective similarity and diversity functions to achieve biologically meaningful clustering of compounds in the descriptor space. Consequently, our methodologies employ variable selection procedures aimed at identifying descriptors most relevant with respect to the target property. Paramount to our approach is rigorous model validation with external datasets which ensures the highest hit rates when predictive QSAR models are ultimately applied to screening chemical databases or virtual libraries for biologically active compounds. Four major areas of concentration in this proposal corresponding to its Specific Aims include: . development of novel, mainly non-linear QSAR methods, such as k nearest neighbor (kNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) approaches. The emphasis will be on the development of novel descriptors of chemical structure, and the efficiency, automation and statistical robustness of the underlying methodologies to afford their application to large commercial datasets. . development of efficient and objective QSAR model validation methodologies, which define the domain of model applicability and maximize the predictive ability of the models. This studies should lead to establishing widely accepted ""good practices"" of reliable and extensively validated QSAR models. . application of validated QSAR modeling methods to various datasets of pharmacological or pharmaceutical significance in collaboration with experimental investigators; this part also includes the development of new approaches for effective data analysis and model interpretation based on advanced algorithms for data compression and mapping from high- to low dimensional descriptor space. . implementation of all modeling methods developed and validated in the course of this work in the publicly accessible UNC QSAR web server. Successful implementation of this proposal is expected to afford highly automated, predictive and accessible QSAR modeling tools, which will benefit a broad research community working in the area of drug design and discovery. n/a",Predictive QSAR Modeling,7088734,R01GM066940,"['Internet', 'chemical structure function', 'computer program /software', 'drug discovery /isolation', 'information systems', 'mathematical model', 'method development', 'model design /development', 'pharmacokinetics', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2006,245716,0.0761124926563579

The methodologies are built upon the similarity principle, i.e., similarity or diversity of chemical structures determines similarity or diversity of their biological action. We argue that chemical similarity should be evaluated in the context of the target property and employ objective similarity and diversity functions to achieve biologically meaningful clustering of compounds in the descriptor space. Consequently, our methodologies employ variable selection procedures aimed at identifying descriptors most relevant with respect to the target property. Paramount to our approach is rigorous model validation with external datasets which ensures the highest hit rates when predictive QSAR models are ultimately applied to screening chemical databases or virtual libraries for biologically active compounds. Four major areas of concentration in this proposal corresponding to its Specific Aims include: . development of novel, mainly non-linear QSAR methods, such as k nearest neighbor (kNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) approaches. The emphasis will be on the development of novel descriptors of chemical structure, and the efficiency, automation and statistical robustness of the underlying methodologies to afford their application to large commercial datasets. . development of efficient and objective QSAR model validation methodologies, which define the domain of model applicability and maximize the predictive ability of the models. This studies should lead to establishing widely accepted ""good practices"" of reliable and extensively validated QSAR models. . application of validated QSAR modeling methods to various datasets of pharmacological or pharmaceutical significance in collaboration with experimental investigators; this part also includes the development of new approaches for effective data analysis and model interpretation based on advanced algorithms for data compression and mapping from high- to low dimensional descriptor space. . implementation of all modeling methods developed and validated in the course of this work in the publicly accessible UNC QSAR web server.

"Predictive QSAR Modeling  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main goal of this project is to develop, validate, and deliver efficient computational tools for rapid and reliable prediction of biological activity and/or related pharmacological or pharmaceutical properties of drug-like molecules. We plan to develop statistically significant and robust Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships(QSAR) methodologies, which incorporate rigorous validation procedures and lead to models with a high predictive power and practical utility. The QSAR approaches are based on the SAR premise: similarity or diversity of chemical structures determines similarity or diversity of their biological action. We argue that formal assessment of chemical similarity or diversity in terms of various chemically relevant molecular descriptors may be inadequate in case of QSAR modeling because the relative association of descriptors with target property (biological activity) is not known a priori. We suggest that the similarity (diversity) should be evaluated in the context of the target property and employ objective similarity and diversity functions to achieve biologically meaningful clustering of compounds in the descriptor space. Therefore, our methodologies employ variable selection procedures aimed at identifying descriptors that are most relevant with respect to the target property. Rigorous model validation ensures the highest hit rates (i.e., the highest content of biologically active compounds in the top scoring compounds) when predictive QSAR models are ultimately applied to screening  chemical databases or virtual libraries.

"Microsystems to Manipulate Fibroblast Chemotaxis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During tissue repair, fibroblast cells chemotax, i.e. migrate in the direction of extracellular chemical gradients, using the numerous biochemical receptors distributed on their surface. This project proposes a new, innovative approach to chemotaxis study by developing a model system and methodology to identify the causality between extracellular ligands imposed onto a fibroblast cell, and the consequent redistribution of intracellular proteins needed to initiate chemotaxis-driving signal cascades. It is our hypothesis that the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAP) cascade regulates fibroblast migration by influencing the distribution of the docking protein, Growth Factor Receptor Bound-2 (GRB2), which binds to the surface receptors activated by the known chemoattractant ligand, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Beta (PDGFB). The current project will test this hypothesis via experiments that utilize our own transparent, single-cell, chemotaxis system nicknamed the microLane, to impose one-dimensional concentration gradients of PDGFB across bovine ligament fibroblast cells. GRB2 molecules of the fibroblasts tested within our system will be labeled and mapped using the fluorescent signatures of nanocrystal Bioconjugates (Q-Dots) bound to GRB2 antibodies, apriori. Quantitative results describing GRB2 redistribution as a function of imposed PDGFB gradients will develop a new and unprecedented method to manipulate fibroblast chemotaxis during wound healing. The results will impact Human health via clinical development of therapeutic technologies in avascular tissue repair, as well as research development of collagen scaffolds and biomaterials needed to advance wound healing.         n/a",Microsystems to Manipulate Fibroblast Chemotaxis,7025786,R21GM071703,"['affinity labeling', 'binding proteins', 'biological signal transduction', 'biotechnology', 'chemotaxis', 'fibroblasts', 'growth factor receptors', 'immunoconjugates', 'immunofluorescence technique', 'method development', 'mitogen activated protein kinase', 'nanotechnology', 'platelet derived growth factor', 'tissue engineering', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R21,2006,149405,0.03407190693390792

"New conserved candidate for egg activation and early embryogenesis in Drosophila.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The transition from egg to embryo is a critical time in development. Since this process is essential for fertility, a better understanding of its mechanisms is important in developmental biology and will also help to optimize ART procedures. It has thus far been very difficult to identify the critical proteins needed for this transition, in part because it is too rapid to involve changes in gene transcription. Instead, numerous lines of evidence argue that this rapid and comprehensive change in cell state is mostly accomplished by post-translational modification of existing proteins. We are focusing on proteins whose phosphorylation state is modulated during egg activation, reasoning that these proteins constitute an enriched pool of molecules important for the egg-to-embryo transition. We propose to use germline-specific RNAi to screen among 258 conserved proteins that our proteomics screens have found to be phospho-modulated during egg activation in Drosophila. By straightforward phenotypic screening that takes advantage of the latest strains and methods for this model organism, we expect to identify the genes that regulate the transition from a mature oocyte to an ""activated"" egg that can begin development, as well as those genes that initiate its embryogenesis. We will prioritize the order of screening, giving precedence to genes likely to encode upstream regulators of this transition, and to one class of downstream effectors: those likely to regulate the cell cycle as it transitions from meiosis to mitosis. Once we have identified these new players, we will use Western blotting and phosph-proteomics to begin to order their actions. The goal of the proposed research is to discover the critical genes that carry out the important developmental transition from egg to embryo. These genes will permit future studies to dissect in detail the molecular interactions and pathways that carry out egg activation and initiate embryogenesis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  To understand fertility, as well as to design optimal methods for infertility treatments such as IVF and ICSI, we need to know the molecules that ""activate"" an egg to develop immediately after fertilization. Few of these molecules are known because of technical difficulties in previous methods to identify proteins that act during this narrow window of time. Taking a new approach, we propose to identify such molecules by screening genetically among a defined set of proteins chosen because their chemical modification state changes when eggs are triggered to activate development in the genetic model system, Drosophila.                ",New conserved candidate for egg activation and early embryogenesis in Drosophila.,8701322,R21HD072714,"['Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Biological Models', 'Calcineurin', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Event', 'Female', 'Fertility', 'Fertilization', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Infertility', 'Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injections', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Meiosis', 'Methods', 'Mitosis', 'Mitotic', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Oocytes', 'Oogenesis', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Poly(A)+ RNA', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Dephosphorylation', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Interference', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Set protein', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Vertebrates', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'base', 'critical period', 'design', 'egg', 'embryonic protein', 'fly', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'screening', 'text searching', 'tool']",NICHD,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,187305,0.019845410672171007

"Replacement Ocular Battery (ROBatt)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this grant project is the development and pre-validation of the Replacement Ocular Battery (ROBatt), a tiered testing strategy consisting of a battery of four alternative ocular irritancy assays, which will replace regulatory mandated acute ocular irritation testing using the Draize Rabbit Eye test. ROBatt consists of the Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability Assay (BCOP), the Chorioallantoic Membrane Vascular Assay using 10-day fertile chicken eggs (CAMVA), the Porcine Corneal Reversibility Assay (PorCORA) and the Porcine Confocal Assay (PorFocal). This tiered strategy follows a decision tree that allows for a thorough interrogation of possible ocular irritants. Although four assays are recommended, in most cases only two or three will be used depending on the degree of irritation. The Specific Aim of the ROBatt project is to validate the decision tree variables using at least 50 chemicals listed in the European Center for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC) data bank, including Corrosive (EEC R41, GHS/EPA Cat 1), Severe (EEC R36, GHS CaL 2, HMIS 2), Moderate (EPA Cat. 3, HMIS 2), Mild (HMIS 1) and Non-irritating (EPA Cat 4, HMIS 0). The long-term project goal is to submit the ROBatt testing strategy to iCCVAM/ECVAM for consideration as a standalone alternative to the Draize Rabbit Eye test. Validation and acceptance of the ROBatt testing strategy will significantly reduce the number of rabbits used in the toxicological assessment of consumer products, chemicals and raw materials by replacing rabbits with four robust alternative assays.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ocular irritation testing is extremely relevant to assuring adequate safety levels of public health as new formulations of chemicals and products are introduced.

"High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The correct functioning of many proteins depends on glycosylation, the addition of sugar molecules (glycans) to selected amino acids in the protein. For example, cancer cells have different glycosylation patterns than ordinary cells, and there is strong evidence that glycoproteins on the surface of egg cells play an essential role in sperm binding. Despite the importance of glycosylation, there are as yet no reliable, high-throughput methods for determining the identity and location of glycans. Glycan identification is currently a manual procedure for experts, involving a combination of chemical assays and mass spectrometry. The automation of the process would have a significant impact on our understanding of this important biological process. The proposed project aims to invent chemical procedures, algorithms, and software for high-throughput analysis of glycan mass spectrometry data. The goal is to bring glycan analysis up to the level of peptide analysis within 3 years. In contrast to peptide analysis, which can leverage genomics data, glycan analysis requires the incorporation of expert knowledge of synthetic pathways, in order to limit the huge number of theoretical combinations of monosaccharides to the much smaller number that are actually synthesized in nature. The project will have to develop novel representations for the evolving expert knowledge, because an exhaustive list- analogous to the human genome- is not currently known. Along with expert knowledge, the project will develop and validate machine learning and statistical techniques for glycan identification. In particular, the project will develop methods for internally calibrating spectra, and will learn fragmentation patterns that can statistically distinguish different types of glycosidic linkages.         n/a",High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra,7628516,R01GM074128,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Carbon', 'Cartoons', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Expert Systems', 'Genomics', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Graft Rejection', 'Human Genome', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monosaccharides', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Polysaccharides', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Work', 'cancer cell', 'egg', 'enzyme activity', 'experience', 'glycosylation', 'glycosyltransferase', 'high throughput analysis', 'immune function', 'improved', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'sperm cell', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIGMS,PALO ALTO RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2009,329306,0.08857333685033214

Despite the importance of glycosylation, there are as yet no reliable, high-throughput methods for determining the identity and location of glycans. Glycan identification is currently a manual procedure for experts, involving a combination of chemical assays and mass spectrometry. The automation of the process would have a significant impact on our understanding of this important biological process. The proposed project aims to invent chemical procedures, algorithms, and software for high-throughput analysis of glycan mass spectrometry data. The goal is to bring glycan analysis up to the level of peptide analysis within 3 years. In contrast to peptide analysis, which can leverage genomics data, glycan analysis requires the incorporation of expert knowledge of synthetic pathways, in order to limit the huge number of theoretical combinations of monosaccharides to the much smaller number that are actually synthesized in nature. The project will have to develop novel representations for the evolving expert knowledge, because an exhaustive list- analogous to the human genome- is not currently known. Along with expert knowledge, the project will develop and validate machine learning and statistical techniques for glycan identification.

"A Simulation Tool to Enable Identification of Critical Network Interactions Using    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the main challenges in the discovery of intracellular biomarkers and identification of therapeutic targets is the lack of a mechanistic understanding of the complex underlying pathways. The tremendous increase in both the quantity and diversity of cellular data represents a significant challenge to researchers seeking to construct biologically relevant interaction maps, and objectively extract specific actionable information. Machine learning based clustering algorithms serve as a preliminary statistical data analysis metric, but they fail to capture the data in the proper biological context. While chemical kinetics based models have proved to be effective in elucidating the pathway mechanisms, accurate estimates for the model parameters are severely lacking and are often impossible to obtain owing to the inherent difficulties involved in making dynamic measurements of specific intracellular phenomena. Additionally, methods for rational prioritization and selection of critical intracellular interactions (in the absence of kinetic information) are sorely lacking. Therefore, there is a clear need for innovative software tools that enable quantitative analysis of available microarray data in a biological pathway context, ultimately leading to the objective identification of critical biological interactions, providing a direction for more focused future efforts. We propose to address this challenge by developing an automated software platform that utilizes microarray data to select and merge relevant canonical biological pathway models thereby placing significantly expressed genes in their biological context. The analysis software will utilize a microarray expression-weighted metric to objectively rank the most critical interactions within the network model using a novel chemical kinetics-free Boolean dynamics algorithm. In the Phase I effort, we will develop a software tool composed of an R library that enables the automated generation of a pathway model from a given microarray dataset. Additionally, a methodology, and associated R library will be developed to objectively rank critical interactions in the pathway model, using a microarray data expression-weighted metric. Demonstration and validation of proposed algorithm will be carried out using a well characterized lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage system. In Phase II, we will extend the scope of the algorithmic framework to include proteomic and metabolomic weighting in the objective ranking of critical interactions, and add workflow improvements through the addition of a graphical user interface (GUI). Experimental verification and validation of critical interactions identified in Phase I will be carried out using gene-silencing techniques. We also intend to establish collaborative partnerships with commercial entities. The proposing team has extensive experience in the areas of systems biology and bioinformatics (CFDRC) and microarray data analysis (Shawn Levy, University of Vanderbilt). CFDRC has a strong track record in the commercialization of software and hardware. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Recently, there has been a tremendous increase in both the amount and diversity of cellular data available to researchers, representing a clear need for the development of advanced computational analysis software to enable the discovery of biomarkers of disease states, and identification of new therapeutic targets. However, currently available analysis tools do not consider the data in a proper biological context. This research proposes to develop an automated software platform that utilizes available data to develop and analyze mathematical models of complex processes in an automated fashion, resulting in the identification of critical intracellular processes.             n/a",A Simulation Tool to Enable Identification of Critical Network Interactions Using,7482734,R43GM084890,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Gene Silencing', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Title', 'Universities', 'Urination', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'base', 'chemical kinetics', 'commercialization', 'editorial', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'simulation', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,CFD RESEARCH CORPORATION,R43,2008,99571,0.05337113682162127
"Stochastic dynamics for multiscale biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Complex biological systems are increasingly subject to investigation by mathematical modeling in general and stochastic simulation in particular. Advanced mathematical methods will be used to generate next-generation computational methods and algorithms for (1) formulating these models, (2) simulating or sampling their stochastic dynamics, (3) reducing them to simpler approximating models for use in multiscale simulation, and (4) optimizing their unknown or partly known parameters to fit observed behaviors and/or measurements. The proposed methods are based on advances in applied statistical and stochastic mathematics, including advances arising from operator algebra, quantum field theory, stochastic processes, statistical physics, machine learning, and related mathematically grounded fields. A central technique in this work will be the use of the operator algebra formulation of the chemical master equation.       The biological systems to be studied include and are representative of high-value biomedical target systems whose complexity and spatiotemporal scale requires improved mathematical and computational methods, to obtain the scientific understanding underlying future medical intervention.

"Activation and Regulation of the Understudied Kinome Using MIB/MS Technology DESCRIPTION: A novel approach has been implemented to study the activation state of protein kinases ""en masse"". Our methods allow isolation and analysis of protein kinases from cell lines, tissues and tumors assayed in a single mass spectrometry run using Multiplexed Inhibitor Beads (MIBs). MIBs consist of mixtures of Sepharose beads with covalently immobilized, linker adapted, kinase inhibitors. Kinase capture is reproducible and is a function of  affinity of kinases for the different immobilized inhibitors as well as the activation state of the  kinase. The inhibitors we have synthesized for linker conjugation to Sepharose beads are primarily type 1 inhibitors that preferentially bind activated states of protein kinases. Extensive  characterization of the MIBs has demonstrated they have a strong preference for binding the active state of kinases and inactive kinases bind poorly. Using a layered bead composition for MIB columns, we are able to capture and identify more than 275 kinases in a single mass spectrometry run. Based on RNA-seq analysis, MIBs are capturing at least 75-80% of the expressed kinome from cell lines, tumors or normal tissues. Importantly, we have captured and characterized up to 275 kinases with as little as 500 mg protein from cell and tissue lysates. This level of sensitivity is essential for kinome analysis when tissue is limiting. Thus, MIB/MS provides an unparalleled scalable biology- based high throughput technology to assay the activation state of the kinome including ""untargeted and understudied"" kinases. There simply are few or no reagents for many of the ""understudied"" kinases, thereby limiting their study and MIB/MS overcomes these limitations. MIB/MS also detects activity changes in kinases for which reagents cannot distinguish closely related kinases (e.g., different activity states of MEK1 vs. MEK2 and ERK1 vs. ERK2, which are assessed together by anti-phospho-antibodies that cannot distinguish isoforms). Similarly, we can easily distinguish the regulation of related receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as DDR1 and DDR2, for which there are few reagents for study. The aims will define comprehensive kinome activation signatures that include poorly or uncharacterized kinases. Aims include: 1. Determine the activation state of the kinome using MIB/MS for a series of human cell lines spanning different cancer types, human and mouse tumors, and normal tissues of the mouse. 2. Determine the response of the kinome to perturbation of cellular physiology using specific chemical probes targeting protein and lipid kinases, cytoskeleton, metabolic regulators, DNA damage and epigenetic chromatin modifying enzymes. 3. Determine the consequence of RNAi knockdown of understudied kinases on the activation state of the kinome. The aims emphasize determining the activation state of understudied kinases and if specific understudied kinases function as part of a signature of kinase activation/inhibition in response to specific cellular perturbations. This analysis will defne the signaling networks and cellular functions for which the activity of understudied kinases are regulated and contribute to homeostatic control mechanisms. The goal is to identify and validate which current understudied kinases function as regulatory nodes within the kinome and warrant future chemical probe development.

"Activation and Regulation of the Understudied Kinome Using MIB/MS Technology DESCRIPTION: A novel approach has been implemented to study the activation state of protein kinases ""en masse"". Our methods allow isolation and analysis of protein kinases from cell lines, tissues and tumors assayed in a single mass spectrometry run using Multiplexed Inhibitor Beads (MIBs). MIBs consist of mixtures of Sepharose beads with covalently immobilized, linker adapted, kinase inhibitors. Kinase capture is reproducible and is a function of  affinity of kinases for the different immobilized inhibitors as well as the activation state of the  kinase. The inhibitors we have synthesized for linker conjugation to Sepharose beads are primarily type 1 inhibitors that preferentially bind activated states of protein kinases. Extensive  characterization of the MIBs has demonstrated they have a strong preference for binding the active state of kinases and inactive kinases bind poorly. Using a layered bead composition for MIB columns, we are able to capture and identify more than 275 kinases in a single mass spectrometry run. Based on RNA-seq analysis, MIBs are capturing at least 75-80% of the expressed kinome from cell lines, tumors or normal tissues.

"Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We have recently developed novel framework for next-generation quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) designed to meet the challenges of biomolecular simulations and drug discovery applications. QMFFs have tremendous computational advantages relative to their fully QM counterparts, being inherently parallelizable and linearly scaling, offering tremendous computational speedup, and promising quantitative accuracy potentially superior to full QM methods. QMFFs accurately model multipolar electrostatics, charge penetration effects, and non-linear polarization response. QMFFs thus offer a transformative technology for drug discovery applications, in particular, for advancing the predictive capability of free energy simulations in lead reﬁnement. These are critically important for the diverse chemical space of drug molecules, including halogen bonding, cation-  and metal-ligand interactions. Further, QMFFs offer a mechanism for modeling covalent inhibitors. Speciﬁcally, we propose to: I. Develop new QMFFs for drug discovery. QMFFs will be developed based on both semiempirical and ab initio density-functional methods in the following stages: 1) determination of multipolar mapping parameters enhancing the DFTB electrostatic potential to reach greater accuracy, 2) augmentation of electronic response terms using chemical potential equalization (CPE) corrections using an orthogonal perturbation-response approach to solve the under-polarization problem of DFTB methods, 3) parameterization of non-electrostatic non-bonded interac- tion parameters using realistic potentials that capture many-body exchange and dispersion interactions, and 4) exploration of statistical potentials, using machine learning approaches applied to quantum data sets, to correct internal conformational energies and short-range interactions. II. Develop new free energy methods to enable protein-ligand binding predictions using QMFFs. We will develop a novel integrated free energy pipeline to pre- dict alchemical binding free energies for ligands and inhibitors. This will include new GPU-accelerated methods for  -space self-adaptive mixture sampling ( -SAMS) and 2D-vFEP analysis, coupled with conformational space enhanced sampling methods for alchemical steps of the thermodynamic cycle, and advancements in free en- ergy “book-ending” methods (BBQm) to efﬁciently connect molecular mechanical force ﬁeld and QMFF model representations. III. Test and validate QMFFs and free energy methods, and apply to MIF inhibitor binding. The methods will be broadly tested against established data sets for solvation free energies, and a drug discovery data set. More in-depth validation studies will be conducted by examining the relative binding free energies of inhibitors of the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF). Finally, exploratory applications will examine mechanisms, characterize transition states and predict rates for covalent inhibition for a series of MIF inhibitors.

"Development of a Novel Membrane Protein Solubilization/Stabilization Screen ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The increasing output of new integral membrane protein (IMP) structures is partially due to the availability of an increasing number of chemical variables such as detergents, detergent-like molecules, lipids, and solubilizing/stabilizing additives. It is clear that specific combinations and concentrations of these different variables are often necessary to improve IMP solubility/stability and crystallization. For each IMP studied, researchers typically explore (via a trial and error approach) many of these chemical variables. However, there is limited understanding of the importance and effect of specific combinations/concentrations of these chemical variables on IMP extraction, solubilization/stabilization, purification and crystallization. We propose to use our novel technology and approach, high-throughput self-interaction chromatography (HSC) combined with an incomplete factorial screen and artificial neural network analysis to discover new formulations that improve/optimize IMP solubility and physical stability (IMP homogeneity). This phase-1 proposal will perform a pilot study on seven different IMPs including the chemokine receptor-1 (CCR1), cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein (CCR1), epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), acid sensing ion channel (ASIC), P- glycoprotein (Pgp), bacteriorhodopsin (BR) and ferric yersiniabactin uptake receptor (FIP). The HSC approach involves rapid experimental determination of second viral coefficient values (B- values) for an incomplete factorial of the total possible number of chemical combinations and concentrations for each IMP. This is followed by input and analysis via an artificial neural network (ANN) program that, once ""trained"", produces B-value predictions for a complete factorial of possible chemical combinations and concentrations. Chemical conditions associated with the most positive B-value predictions (suggesting improved solubility and physical stability) are then experimentally validated via HSC measurements followed by evaluation of the IMP's stability/folding (via differential scanning calorimetry, Western gels, CD and when available, bio- assays), solubility and stability in several of these solutions. It is possible that the proposed comprehensive analysis of chemical variables will result in new combinations and/or concentrations that may become useful ""cocktails"" to be included in screening solubility and stability new IMPs within the same class of IMPs. However, the major goal of the proposed research is to demonstrate the value of the HSC technology and approach to determine novel and improved solubilization/stabilization solutions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Researchers typically explore a variety of detergents and detergent/lipid combinations in attempts to enable isolation, purification of integral membrane proteins (IMPs) to support biological, drug discovery and structural biology studies. IMPs, important proteins involved in human disease, are the targets of more than 50% of all drugs currently under development. The inability to express, solubilize and purify homogeneous preparations represents a major bottleneck in IMP research adversely affecting drug development pipeline. This proposal involves use of a novel technology and experimental approach to determine novel combinations and concentrations of existing detergents and additives that can improve the solubility, stability and crystallization of IMPs.            ",Development of a Novel Membrane Protein Solubilization/Stabilization Screen,8831266,R41GM109565,"['ASIC channel', 'Affect', 'Bacteriorhodopsins', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caliber', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatography', 'Crystallization', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Detergents', 'Development', 'Differential Scanning Calorimetry', 'Drug Formulations', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Epithelial', 'Evaluation', 'Excipients', 'Gel', 'Goals', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Lipids', 'Measurement', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Output', 'P-Glycoprotein', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sodium Channel', 'Solubility', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Viral', 'chemokine receptor', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'epithelial Na+ channel', 'human disease', 'improved', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'screening', 'structural biology', 'uptake', 'yersiniabactin']",NIGMS,"SOLUBLE THERAPEUTICS, INC.",R41,2015,153004,0.14476302807273178
"Determination of structure, dynamics and energetics of enzyme reactions Project Summary  Understanding enzyme mechanisms is of paramount importance from both the basic biophysics perspective of understanding life processes and the role of enzymes in diseases. To achieve a detailed understanding of enzyme catalysis, the effects of protein structure and dynamics on the reaction energetics need to be elucidated. We propose a combined computational and experimental approach that combines the synthetic, computational and structural biology expertise of a team of investigators that has been working together for >15 years to create a “molecular movie” where the position, movement and energy of every atom in the system followed over the entire reaction pathway. The proposal exploits the emerging convergence of timescales accessible by molecular simulation using GPUs and time resolved structural biology. Specific Aim 1 describes the simulation of the complete reaction pathway of Pseudomonas mevalonii (Pm) HMGCoA Reductase (HMGR) and will use transition state force fields (TSFFs) generated by the quantum guided molecular mechanics method to allow the µsec MD simulations of the chemical steps. TSFFs not only circumvent the well-known boundary problem of QM/MM, but are also 102-104 times faster. This allows a realistic modeling of the coupling of µsec dynamics and catalysis that was demonstrated in the last grant period to be essential for understanding the reaction. Together with accelerated MD simulations of the conformational changes involved in the reaction using standard force fields, these computational studies cover the fsec to µsec timescale. In Specific Aim 2, the computational results will be merged with the results of a three-tiered approach to obtain structural snapshots with progressively increasing time resolution: (i) “Frozen” intermediates that map out the overall pathway on long timescales, (ii) time resolved Laue crystallography using pH jump initiation on the msec timescale and (iii) use of photocaged substrates to allow time resolved Laue experiments on the µsec timescale. This approach will be applied to the study of HMGR, an enzyme of high biophysical and biomedical significance that has a complex reaction mechanism involving three chemical steps, six large-scale conformational changes and two cofactor exchange steps. The project is highly innovative because it (i) uses a combination of MD simulations using TSFFs and time resolved crystallography to span timescales of at least 12 orders of magnitude, (ii) iteratively couples the Markov State analysis of long timescale trajectories to the Singular Value Decomposition used to analyze time resolved crystallography data, thus providing new tools to generate and experimentally validate trial structures (iii) applies global optimization and machine learning techniques to allow the automated fitting of TSFFs for proteins, which will enhance the application of this powerful method to other proteins and (iv) provides new photocaged substrates for the study of enzyme mechanisms to the chemical biology community. All tool compounds, methods and codes developed in this project will be made available to the scientific community. Public Health Statement  The detailed study of enzyme mechanisms is a cornerstone of biophysical chemistry that, while basic in nature, has had a major impact on human health including the development of new mechanism-based drugs for a range of diseases and an understanding of the mechanism of action for existing drugs that allows the design of combination therapies. The combination of Laue crystallography and long-scale MD simulations will allow simultaneous studies of structure, dynamics and energetic studies with unprecedented detail. The application to HMG CoA Reductase, arguably the single most important drug target in western industrialized countries, will demonstrate the applicability of the methodology to an enzyme of high mechanistic complexity. 1","Determination of structure, dynamics and energetics of enzyme reactions",9897100,R01GM111645,"['Active Sites', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Couples', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enzymatic Biochemistry', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Free Energy', 'Freezing', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Movement', 'Mutagenesis', 'Nature', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Pseudomonas', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical chemistry', 'cofactor', 'computer studies', 'design', 'electron density', 'enzyme mechanism', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'millisecond', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'molecular scale', 'movie', 'new therapeutic target', 'particle', 'protein structure', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'structural biology', 'synthetic biology', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2020,335664,0.0692563318555937

"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Humans rely on the microbial communities that colonize the gut for a wide variety of critical functions, including nutrition, immune system maturation, protection against infection by disease-causing microbes, and detoxification of environmental chemicals. Daily life is punctuated by events, such as exposure to antibiotics or other chemicals, or changes in diet, that sometimes disturb or destabilize our microbial communities with potentially severe and sustained negative impacts on health. We propose an ambitious study in which we will monitor the microbial communities of healthy humans before, during and after several types of planned disturbance, and discover community features that predict future stability or future recovery from disturbance, with the expectation that our findings will fundamentally change the practice of medicine.",Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome,9325416,R01AI112401,"['Allergic Disease', 'Antibiotics', 'Attention', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Statistical Methods', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'data integration', 'environmental chemical', 'expectation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical methods', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'pathogen', 'public health relevance', 'resilience', 'response', 'theories', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'urinary']",NIAID,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2017,765521,0.03732836501827639

"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience.

"Estrogen receptor control of inflammatory gene expression Menopause induces systemic inflammation that contributes to impaired endocrine and bone function, metabolic disease, obesity, as well as autoimmunity and cognitive decline. These observations highlight a critical need to understand the relationship between estrogen signaling and inflammation. The overarching problem in both our basic understanding and therapeutic targeting of nuclear receptors remains an almost complete lack of understanding of how small differences in ligands can drive widely different transcriptional outcomes, including pathway and tissue-selective signaling. The goal is to define the chemical, structural, and molecular rules for how the estrogen receptor-α (ERα) ligands control inflammatory gene expression through binding directly or indirectly to DNA and altering coregulator recruitment, which in turn controls gene expression. A systems biology approach to chemical biology and structural biology will be used to reveal rules for how ligands achieve signaling specificity. Specific Aim 1. Discover and characterize the epigenetic regulome that mediates differential effects of ERα ligands on the inflammatory response. Functional genomics approaches will be used to identify three sets of inflammatory gene sets that we hypothesize will show distinct rules for gene control: 1) TNF-induced, E2 modulated genes with composite ERE/κB sites 2) TNF-induced, E2 modulated genes with ERα tethering to κB response elements; and 3) TNF-induce genes where ERα bounds but does not modulate. We will pick 3-4 representative genes from each category to target with an shRNA screen targeting all coregulators (~1200 shRNAmir targeting ~300 genes) to identify those required for ERα modulation. Coregulator-ERα interaction screens will be built and profiled with a compound library of 500 ERα ligands. Statistical models will enable identification of specific coregulator interactions that predict the inflammatory response to different classes of ligands and ties them to specific structural perturbations. Specific Aim 2. Identify the chemical and structural rules by which ERα transduces chemical structure into recruitment of specific signaling complexes that control inflammatory gene expression. Analysis of >100 crystal structures will be used to compute all atom distance matrices and use principal component analysis and multiple linear regression to identify ligand-induced perturbations that predict (1) regulation of specific genes, and (2) interaction with specific coregulators defined in Specific Aim 1. Impact: This work will identify structural rules for how ERα ligands differentially regulate inflammatory gene expression through the ligand-receptor interface allosterically controlling recruitment of an ensemble of specific coregulatory complexes. Identifying causal models for how ligands achieve signaling specificity impacts drug discovery and our understanding of the physiology underlying a variety of hormone-sensitive physiological systems and disease states, and should be readily translatable to other allosteric signaling systems including other nuclear receptors and GPCRs.   Following menopause, systemic and localized inflammation contribute to a suite of changes attributed to loss of estrogenic signaling, including obesity, autoimmunity, diabetes, and impaired endocrine and bone function, while there are important gender differences across human diseases with central inflammatory components, including infectious and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. The goal of this proposal is to define how different small molecule ligands of the estrogen receptor-α bind to the receptor and induce ligand-specific effects on controlling inflammatory genes.

"Crowdsourcing Phenotypes - Diversity Supplement     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bringing new drugs to market is a lengthy and expensive endeavor.

This method is based on a hypothesis that the tissue pattern of the expression of drug targets is essential for the unbiased matching of phenotypes to potential drugs. Matching complex molecular biomarkers of a disease to drugs thus depends on knowledge of the complete molecular signature (polypharmacologic fingerprint) of the drug or drug combination. Our approach is based on integration of large datasets from chemical and 'omics' databases and developing algorithms to link clinical phenotypes with drugs and drug-like chemicals.

"Novel tool for linking drugs to phenotypes - I-Corps Supplement DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bringing new drugs to market is a lengthy and expensive endeavor. To increase the number of affordable new drugs available to consumers at reasonable costs, the efficiency of the drug development process must be greatly improved. We aim to develop a novel tool that addresses this challenge by rapid identification of drug targets and drug candidates for any given clinical phenotype utilizing our newly developed computational method. This method is based on a hypothesis that the tissue pattern of the expression of drug targets is essential for the unbiased matching of phenotypes to potential drugs. Matching complex molecular biomarkers of a disease to drugs thus depends on knowledge of the complete molecular signature (polypharmacologic fingerprint) of the drug or drug combination. Our approach is based on integration of large datasets from chemical and 'omics' databases and developing algorithms to link clinical phenotypes with drugs and drug-like chemicals. This is achieved by identifying the polypharmacologic profile of bioactive drugs and matching this drug-based profile to a phenotype-based tissue profile of a disease, which is derived from the computational analysis of 'omics' data. We have already developed and validated the 'drug' module of this system. Here we propose to (a) develop the 'phenotype' module, which will include the phenotype-tissue-target data via integration of clinical phenotypes, tissue-specific target expression, and GWAS and microarray data; (b) develop 'matching' algorithms for the modules that will build a direct link between drugs and clinical phenotypes as well as a ranking system for those matches; (c) validate this system using well-established clinical phenotypes and drugs for their treatment. When completed, the proposed research will result in a system that will allow users to instantly identify the ranked list of predicted drugs for any given clinical phenotype. Alternatively, it can be used to identify a list f phenotypes associated with any given drug/compound or drug/compound combination. This addresses a major challenge in the drug development process, improving the productivity and efficiency of the drug discovery phase, and it provides a useful and highly desired tool for the pharmaceutical industry and for academic research.

"Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of highly efficient and accurate approaches to structure-based virtual screening (VS) continues to represent a formidable challenge in the field of computational drug discovery. Outstanding and widely recognized research problems in the field include the relative computational inefficiency of most approaches, which limits the size of molecular libraries used for virtual screening; the low hit rate; and the inaccurate prediction of ligand binding affinity and pose. The proposed studies address these challenges by using innovative and computationally efficient approaches to VS that fully integrate concepts from the complementary fields of cheminformatics and molecular simulation to devise an integrated two-step VS methodology. Building upon our experience in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling, we aim to develop novel, computationally efficient cheminformatics approaches to pre-process very large (on the order of 107 compounds) chemical libraries available for biological screening, and eliminate up to 99% of improbable ligands. Only the remaining 1% of probable ligands will be evaluated by slower but accurate ensemble flexible docking approaches relying on molecular simulation techniques. The cheminformatics step will also produce important information on privileged protein-ligand interactions that will be used in a live-processing step to guide the structure-based virtual screening and avoid oversampling of ligand poses. Moreover, post- processing cheminformatics methods will be implemented to filter out decoy poses from docking calculations. The ultimate goal of our hybrid methodology is to arrive at a small set of high-affinity computational hits in receptor-bound conformations that can be validated experimentally. We will pursue this goal following three specific aims: 1) Develop novel cheminformatics-based virtual screening approaches to eliminate both improbable ligands and improbable poses, as well as generate information on preferred protein-ligand interactions; 2) Develop new, efficient flexible ensemble docking methods guided by the preferred protein- ligand interactions to select the most probable ligands and predict their binding poses; 3) Apply the developed hierarchical virtual screening workflow to several therapeutic targets and test high-confidence computational hits in experimental assays. All computational tools resulting from this project will be made publicly available. This proposal is innovative because the proposed VS platform will result from a unique marriage of disparate approaches for VS, combining their corresponding strengths. This proposal is significant because the implementation of this project will enable substantial improvement in the efficiency, accuracy, and experimentally-confirmed impact of structure-based drug discovery tools.

"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets. Data collected in this project will be aggregated with existing information from previous NIH-funded large-scale structural and genomic projects to create a Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK) that provides gene-by-gene and network-level information on the dark kinome and its interaction with other signal transduction and regulatory networks. Close coordination with the NIH LINCS project will ensure data interoperability and make efficient use of informatics tools. The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands. Aim 5 will involve collaboration with other investigators to assay the expression and function of DKs in primary human cells and tissues relevant to the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative. All aims will be pursued in parallel for a progressively expanding resource of data and tools for continued study of DKs.

The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands. Aim 5 will involve collaboration with other investigators to assay the expression and function of DKs in primary human cells and tissues relevant to the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative. All aims will be pursued in parallel for a progressively expanding resource of data and tools for continued study of DKs.

"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets.

"Quantifying the role of adaptation in olfactory coding through the logic of navigation Project Summary This project’s long-term goal is a fuller understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of olfactory sensory adaptation that facilitate odor discrimination in the natural world. To confront the wide fluctuations in intensity and temporal variability that are characteristic of natural odor environments, animals have evolved refined neurosensory mechanisms for parsing behaviorally-relevant signals such as pheromones from background nuisance odors. This project seeks to elucidate how adaptive mechanisms in the olfactory periphery play a central role in this discrimination task. The project will utilize a novel behavioral assay that permits precise quantification of the logic used by insects in navigating complex, temporally dynamic odor environments. By combining this assay with data analytic methods and machine learning, a comprehensive lexicon of archetypal navigational strategies of insect odor navigation will be derived. Importantly, since both odors and insects can be simultaneously tracked in this assay, the project will uncover strategies employed by insects in not just static, but also fluctuating odor landscapes. By quantifying how these strategies modulate in time, the role of memory in shaping navigational strategies will also be determined. The project will then leverage this dictionary of navigational logic to quantify how various mechanisms of adaptation in Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons can shape odor discrimination. Importantly, this project will examine the role of olfactory sensory adaptation in an ethologically-relevant way, by connecting mechanisms that operate at the level of sensory input with neural computations that affect output behavior. Further, since the behavioral assay tracks complex odor environments simultaneous with freely-moving insects, the impact of behavior on future signal acquisition – behavioral feedback onto odor stimuli – is fully maintained. The behavioral experiments and data analysis in this project utilize the tractable, highly-characterized system of Drosophila melanogaster, in which a wealth of existing genetic tools will allow directed experimentation of specific adaptive mechanisms in olfaction. The results of this project will elucidate how insects effectively navigate complex odor environments, and how olfactory systems maintain sensitivity despite odor conflicts and temporal variability. Project Narrative This project will contribute to our understanding of how the olfactory sensory periphery and neural circuitry have evolved to effectively encode our vast and varied chemical environment. The project will help reveal how odor discrimination capability is maintained in natural odor landscapes, leading to practical interventional strategies for the control of disease vectors such as tsetse flies and mosquitos, who rely critically on their sense of smell to navigate. Chemical sensing is the only shared sensation among organisms as simple as bacteria and as complex as humans, and this project will enhance our fundamental knowledge of this universal sensory modality.",Quantifying the role of adaptation in olfactory coding through the logic of navigation,9868821,F32MH118700,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Culicidae', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Dictionary', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Vectors', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Insecta', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Left', 'Logic', 'Lymph', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Olfactory Receptor Neurons', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pheromone', 'Photosensitivity', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Tsetse Flies', 'Walking', 'analytical method', 'disorder control', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'light intensity', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mutant', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurosensory', 'novel', 'odorant-binding protein', 'optogenetics', 'preservation', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,69554,0.05204149959746147
"A Multiwell Plate Format Microfluidic Immobilization Chip for High-Content Imaging of Whole Animals for in vivoNeurotoxicology Testing Project Summary: Neurotoxicological evaluation of new compounds intended for human use or of potential human exposure is mandated by international regulatory bodies and largely relies on lethality testing in higher-order vertebrate animals. High screening costs, long experimental times, and legislative requirements to reduce dependence on animal testing have led many industries to search for alternative technologies. In vitro toxicology testing uses isolated cells or monotypic cell culture and can only provide limited insight since these models lack biologically relevant intact multi-typic cellular network structures. While both technologies have been augmented by in silico technologies, there is still a non-trivial gap between what can be learned and translated from simple, fast, inexpensive in vitro methods versus longer, complex, and costly in vivo studies in higher order animals. Newormics’ approach to filling this gap is to enable in vivo neurotoxicological assessment in Caenorhabditis elegans, an accepted alternative invertebrate model organism, by developing neuron-specific toxicity assays, delivered via a proprietary high-density, large-scale microfluidic immobilization device for high-content, high throughput analysis. Building on advances made during Phase I and important market learnings from participation in the NIH I-Corps program, Phase II proposes several new elements of innovation to achieve our goals in 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will convert our first-generation microfluidic device to a high-density (384- well) vivoChip with improved microfabrication technologies, incorporate on-chip culture for transfer-less exposure and testing, and integrate automation for chip loading, imaging, and analysis. These measures will significantly increase test scale (from 80 compounds per chip to 280) and lower the consumable and labor costs per test. In Aim 2, building on our dopaminergic neurotox assay from Phase I, we will develop four neurotox assays with brightly fluorescently labeled dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons providing the unprecedented ability to assess subtle phenotypic effects of chemicals on individual intact, functional neurons. To achieve real-time image processing, multi-parameter phenotyping, and managing the terabytes of image data generated per test, we will build a computational platform empowered by a graphic user interface. This platform will be used for image compilation, user-annotated phenotype definition and scoring, and automated report generation with appropriate statistical analysis. In Aim 3, with our industry partners, we will validate our platform and assays using reference chemicals. As more chemicals are tested, we will build a database which can be further mined. The outcome of this work will enable many industries to reduce lethal animal testing and get safer industrial and personal consumer products to market faster for economic benefit, reaching regulatory compliance for reduced animal use, and improved healthcare for neurological diseases. Narrative: The proposed work will enable the use of a small invertebrate model organism, C. elegans, for neuron-specific analysis of neurodegeneration phenotypes from high-resolution fluorescence images of individual neurons at high throughputs. The proposed imaging system and the neuron-specific assays will provide an unprecedented ability to assess developmental neurotoxicity in an intact, live, whole organism, down to a neuronal mechanism- of-action level.

"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods.

"High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important condensed phase probes of composition, structure and dynamics of biomolecules and bio-organic species. NMR observables such as chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings can be measured to very high accuracy. Because they are sensitive to the biological functional groups, detailed geometries, and chemical environments, they allow for prediction of solution phase protein structures or to identify or verify the structure of chemical compounds in the crystalline phase. The connection to structure, while true in principle, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to reveal in practice through direct assignment of the spectrum. Simulation methods that accurately predict spectral observables from structure are a key goal for NMR spectral assignment. Such methods are even more crucial for the inverse problem of realizing high quality NMR structures of folded proteins from spectra, and as powerful restraints for determining the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Existing approaches to this problem typically rely on semi-empirical heuristics, and while they have achieved considerable success, they also reveal limitations that significantly degrade the quality of structural prediction. In this equipment supplement we are proposing to acquire a dedicated compute cluster for high throughput calculations of wavefunction-based QM methods we have developed for chemical shifts that offer improved accuracy over DFT. This will be employed to populate databases that reflect protein and small molecule drug relevant for machine learning methods we have developed under NIH support. With such data, machine learning and deep networks will determine a quantitative relationship between structure and computed NMR observable, and the resulting data science driven methods will be tested on the refinement of folded proteins and small molecule drug prediction. NMR shifts and splitting measurements for organic materials containing 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei can provide detailed descriptions of the structure of drug molecules, folded proteins and their complexes, as well as the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). However there are currently limitations of turning accurate NMR measurements into accurate structures that clearly hampers advances that could be made on connecting structure to function of proteins in their native aqueous environments. This supplemental equipment proposal aims to use machine learning on QM data through the purchase of a high-throughput GPU/CPU cluster, and will significantly improve the ability to predict the chemical shifts and indirect spin-spin couplings to yield the spectrum associated with a given folded structure or drug crystal, with very high accuracy, and with good computational efficiency.",High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,10145510,U01GM121667,"['Biological', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Proteins', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'crystallinity', 'drug structure', 'functional group', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'success']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,U01,2020,150000,0.11801715224077781

"HLS13-04 High-Content High-Throughput Screen for Diamond Blackfan Anemia Treatments ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are thousands of rare genetic diseases that have no approved treatment. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug discovery platform that seeks to re-purpose known drugs for the treatment of such diseases. The platform consists of high content immunofluorescent image analysis using machine-learning algorithms to identify relevant and on-target changes induced by both RNAi and various chemicals. This system has been used to identify a phenotype for loss of function of two related genes, RPS19 and RPS10 in multiple human cell types. Mutations in these genes are the primary cause of Diamond Blackfan Anemia, a rare genetic disease with no specific targeted therapy. In this grant, we propose to: develop RPS19 and RPS10 knockout cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 technology; evaluate knockout cell lines for phenotypes ('phenoprints') using our drug discovery platform; conduct chemical suppressor screens of thousands of known drug candidates to identify those that  ameliorate on-target phenoprints associated with loss of RPS19 and RPS10; expand the capabilities of our drug screening platform to enable the use of non-adherent cell lines in  our workflow and use the expanded capabilities to confirm the validity of drugs identifie as candidate therapies in  CD34+ suspended cell culture models of Diamond Blackfan Anemia. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has the experience, tools, and drive to execute this Phase I SBIR proposal, and to accelerate commercial development of any compounds arising from the project. The proposed study would have significant societal and commercial implications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA) is a rare genetic disease for which no targeted therapy exists. Loss of function in RPS19 and RPS10, or other ribosomal protein genes, results in the disease. We will use chemical suppressor screens of known drugs, based on structural changes in cellular disease models, to identify potential therapeutics for treatment of DBA.            ",HLS13-04 High-Content High-Throughput Screen for Diamond Blackfan Anemia Treatments,8902889,R43HL127820,"['A549', 'Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Animal Model', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD34 gene', 'Cavernous Malformation', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cerebrum', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computer software', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diamond-Blackfan anemia', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Erythrocytes', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Hydrops Fetalis', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Orphan Drugs', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'RNA Interference', 'Rare Diseases', 'Ribosomal Proteins', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Stem cells', 'Stroke', 'Structural defect', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'bone marrow failure syndrome', 'cell type', 'disease phenotype', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'early onset', 'erythroid differentiation', 'experience', 'high throughput screening', 'knock-down', 'loss of function', 'new technology', 'phase 2 study', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'public health relevance', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'working group']",NHLBI,"RECURSION PHARMACEUTICALS, LLC",R43,2015,217352,0.06635961213466712
"Feature Learning For Improved Multiplex Disease Diagnosis Abstract This proposal is for CATTS, a feature learning technique optimized for use in multiplex mass spectrometry (MS) fingerprinting assays.

"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public.

"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents.

"Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The study of biomolecular interactions and design of new therapeutics requires accurate physical models of the atomistic interactions between small molecules and biological macromolecules. Over the least few decades, molecular mechanics force ﬁelds have demonstrated the potential that physical models hold for quantitative biophysical modeling and predictive molecular design. However, a signiﬁcant technology gap exists in our ability to build force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy, can be systematically improved in a statistically robust manner, be extended to new areas of chemistry, can model post-translational and covalent modiﬁcations, are able to quantify systematic errors in predictions, and can be broadly applied across a high-performance software packages. In this project, we willl bridge this technology gap to enable new generations of accurate quantitative biomolec- ular modeling and (bio)molecular design for chemical biology and drug discovery. In Aim 1, we will produce a modern, open infrastructure to enable practitioners to rapidly and conveniently construct and employ accurate and statistically robust physical force ﬁelds via automated machine learning methods. In Aim 2, we will construct open, machine-readable experimental and quantum chemical datasets that will accelerate next-generation force ﬁeld development. In Aim 3, we will develop statistically robust Bayesian inference techniques to enable the auto- mated construction of type assignment schemes that avoid overﬁtting and selection of physical functional forms statistically justﬁed by the data. This approach will also provide an estimate of the systematic error in predicted properties arising from uncertainty in parameters or functional form choices—generally the dominant source of error—to be quantiﬁed with little added expense. In Aim 4, we will integrate and apply this infrastructure to produce open, transferable, self-consistent force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy and broad coverage for modeling small molecule interactions with biomolecules (including unnatural amino or nucleic acids and covalent modiﬁcations by organic molecules), with the ultimate goal of covering all major biomolecules.

"Computational Explorations of Unconventional Approaches to Control Noncovalent Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY The research interests of my group are rooted in explorations of new and useful conceptual models to improve the control and prediction of noncovalent interactions. Our research involves the use of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools, applications of density functional theory (DFT), cheminformatics, and machine-learning methods. A premise of our research is that aromaticity may be used to modulate many types of noncovalent interactions (such as hydrogen bonding, π-stacking, anion-π interactions). The reciprocal relationship we find, between “aromaticity” in molecules and the strengths of “noncovalent interactions,” is surprising especially since they are typically considered as largely separate ideas in chemistry. The innovation of this research is that it will enable use of intuitive “back-of-the-envelope” electron-counting rules (such as the 4n+2πe Hückel rule for aromaticity) to make predictions of experimental outcomes regarding the impact of noncovalent interactions. A five-year goal is to realize the use of our conceptual models in real synthetic examples prepared by our experimental collaborators. My research vision is to bridge discoveries of innovative concepts to their practical impacts for biomedical and biomolecular research.

"A Machine Learning Platform for Adaptive Chemical Screening Project Summary High-throughput screening remains the most common method to identify the primary chemical hits in chemical biology and drug discovery projects. However, large-scale screens are often financially out of reach for many academic labs. The resulting small screens of small chemical libraries often identify few confirmed hits, most of which are unsuitable for medicinal chemistry follow-up. There is a critical need for computational tools that can guide experimental screening at a reasonable cost while exploring far more chemicals. This proposal will develop a computational platform that can be applied to any target or phenotypic system to select compounds for experimental screening from virtual chemical libraries with a billion or more compounds. New machine learning and high-throughput computing methods will navigate this large chemical space strategically and efficiently, improving the quality of the identified compounds. The computationally guided screening can ultimately improve the chemical diversity, target specificity, and stability of the identified active compounds, accelerating and enabling drug discovery across NIH Institutes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop technologies that make chemical screening accessible to more research groups and enable drug discovery in any therapeutic area. Data science techniques can take advantage of existing public bioactivity data in PubChem to help prioritize chemical screening for a new target. In this technology development proposal, the researchers will 1) determine a general initial screening compound set, 2) develop a computationally-guided iterative screening system, and 3) create and experimentally validate an end-to-end high-throughput computing workflow that directs drug discovery for any new target. At each step, rigorous comparisons to experimental results and baseline models will ensure the methods are working as expected and offer capabilities that do not exist in the current state-of-the-art computational methods. The resulting computational platform will improve the efficiency of and reduce the barriers to chemical screening, ultimately making screening for new compounds available to academic research groups in ways and in places where it has previously been inaccessible. Project Narrative The proposed project is broadly relevant to public health as a critical advancement of technology to enable basic biomedical research across therapeutic areas. This effort creates a computational platform to reduce the overall cost and improve the quality of high-throughput screening in any chemical biology or drug discovery project, which will be rigorously compared to existing experimental techniques. Modern data science tools will reduce the barriers to high-throughput screening and make screening for new compounds available to academic research groups in ways and in places where it has previously been inaccessible.",A Machine Learning Platform for Adaptive Chemical Screening,10049862,R01GM135631,"['Active Learning', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Budgets', 'Chemicals', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protac', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'PubChem', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening Result', 'Seeds', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'body system', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lead optimization', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'prevent', 'protein degradation', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'technology development', 'therapeutic target', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'virtual library', 'virtual screening']",NIGMS,"MORGRIDGE INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, INC.",R01,2020,475021,0.08192673469159871
"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis.

"Imaging Molecular Level Details of Collagen Fibers by VSFG Microscopy In this proposed project, we plan to fill the knowledge gap of the relationships between microscopic self-assembled structures, collagen-molecule interactions and macroscopic fiber morphologies of type-I collagen, the primary component of most human tissues and a commonly used biomaterial for tissue engineering. By investigating collagen-water and collagen-protein interactions in in vitro systems that mimic basic aspects of physiologically relevant three- dimensional fibrillar tissue architectures, we aim to fill knowledge gaps in fundamental collagen research. We will achieve this goal by developing a hyperspectral imaging technique – vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) microscopy – at high repetition rates (400 kHz) and apply it to collagen. The long-term vision is to develop new biophysics methods to reveal molecular-level structures and interactions for pericellular space research and other complex biological environments, and eventually applying it to study various pericellular environment related diseases. In order to correlate spectral features to microscopic and macroscopic structures of type I collagen, we plan to apply machine-learning techniques to analyze our data and extract spectral signatures of collagen’s micro/macrostructures. We will two major scientific focuses: (A) understanding molecular signatures of microscopic self-assembly fibrils structures and its relationship to the macroscopic morphology (plan 1 and 2); and (B) investigating molecular level collagen-molecule interactions (plan 3 and 4). Specific plans include:  1. Obtaining hyperspectral VSFG images of collagen tissues to study their morphology in a  label free and non-invasive manner  2. Establishing molecular spectral signatures of self-assembled collagen fibril structures  3. Understanding collagen-water interaction in first solvation layer of collagen fibers.  4. Imaging spatial locations of chemicals and peptides that interact with collagens. If successful, the significance is that a label free, vibrational mode specific imaging technique specific for pericellular space will be available, which can reveal molecular level insights of collagen structures and its interactions with surrounding molecules, pertinent to fibrosis and cell— pericellular space interaction related diseases. This proposed project contributes to the scope of NIGMS by developing new technology to reveal fundamental molecular-level principle, mechanism and signatures related to morphology of collagen I at both micro- and macroscopic scales, and collagen-molecule interactions, laying foundations for biophysical/biochemical principles for future biomedical applications related to collagens. This proposed development of vibrational sum frequency generation microscopy, in the short term, will spatially resolve collagen tissues with chemical structure and molecular interaction information in a complicated environment. Machine learning and simulation approaches will be employed to build a data base to convert hyperspectral images of collagen into a spatial map with microscopic structures and molecular interaction information. In the long term, the fundamental biochemical knowledge learned from this development will lay foundations for rationally design biomedical approaches to monitor and control pericellular spaces and its interaction with cells, and further advance treatment to diseases related to it.",Imaging Molecular Level Details of Collagen Fibers by VSFG Microscopy,10028946,R35GM138092,"['3-Dimensional', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Fiber', 'Collagen Fibril', 'Collagen Type I', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fiber', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Peptides', 'Physiological', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'Water', 'biophysical techniques', 'design', 'human tissue', 'image reconstruction', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'new technology', 'self assembly', 'simulation', 'vibration']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R35,2020,393958,0.04049777512721857
"Combining chemical and computational tools for predictive models of microbiome communities ABSTRACT The gut microbiome has a tremendous impact on health and disease, actively contributing to obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular diseases, and several poorly understood neurological disorders. We do not yet have the necessary tools to precisely probe these microbial communities, though such tools could unlock extensive benefits to human health. Elucidating the contributions of individual species or consortia of bacteria would provide a rational basis for understanding microbiota-controlled disease and lead to novel therapies. To carry out the fundamental research planned in this proposal, we will tackle three major problems: First, we will build the first set of molecular tools that effectively and precisely modulate the microbiome bacteria; second, we will analyze the multiscale dynamics of microbial communities; and third, we will construct an ingestible biosensor for real-time monitoring of microbiome populations. Although antibiotics and fecal transplants can reconfigure microbial consortia, they do not precisely target individual bacteria. Conversely, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have evolved to selectively attack pathogenic bacteria but do not target microbiome bacteria, constituting desirable scaffolds for molecular engineering and potential sources of microbiome-targeting agents. We will develop a new computational peptide design methodology, based on classical and hybrid-quantum mechanical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to create a groundbreaking assessment of the dynamical and emergent properties of AMPs. Chemical synthesis and large-scale screening will confirm predicted selectivity against microbiome species, and a machine learning workflow will connect sequences of individual peptides to their dynamics and activity. We will then apply the synthetic AMPs to interrogate the human microbiome by selectively removing species during bacterial consortia experiments, to be carried out in bioreactors, under regular or anaerobic conditions. We will pair our experiments with whole-cell metabolic network models, providing a systems biology perspective to the analysis of inter-species interactions. An integrated ingestible biosensing device will be developed to monitor the microbiome by electrochemically sensing unique biomarkers from gut microbes. This will provide the first real-time measurements of microbiome composition and will be integrated to our bioreactors for testing, to ultimately be used for in vivo tests. This work will build the first set of molecular and computational tools for microbiome engineering and will lay the foundation to address critical gaps in our understanding of the gut micro-environment, and of the contributions of gut bacteria to the etiology of disease. Grounded in our demonstrated expertise in synthetic biology, computer science, microbiology, and electrical engineering, this project will provide a computational- experimental framework for developing a peptide encyclopedia for the gut microbiome, in line with NIH's public health mission and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The gut microbiome plays roles in nutrition, immunity, metabolism, and several poorly understood neurological disorders. Suitable tools, however, do not yet exist for engineering the microbial communities that constitute the human microbiome. The proposed research introduces the first molecular tools to precisely understand the functions of microbiome communities in our health and disease in order to then delineate therapeutic interventions for diseases mediated by the gut microbiota, thereby addressing NIH's public health mission.",Combining chemical and computational tools for predictive models of microbiome communities,10029354,R35GM138201,"['Address', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological Markers', 'Bioreactors', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Encyclopedias', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hybrids', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Microbiology', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Role', 'Source', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'antimicrobial peptide', 'base', 'chemical synthesis', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fecal transplantation', 'fundamental research', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'in vivo evaluation', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'molecular dynamics', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'novel therapeutics', 'nutrition', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'predictive modeling', 'quantum', 'real time monitoring', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'targeted agent', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R35,2020,342713,0.043851393615729206
"Spatiotemporal control of concentration gradients with electrochemistry in extracelluar space Project Summary  The natural environment is intrinsically spatiotemporally heterogenous at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. What shapes such a heterogeneity includes the concentration gradients of biologically relevant chemical species in the extracellular medium including dioxygen (O2), reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as essential redox-active transition metals. While a significant amount of effort has been devoted to spectroscopically image these chemical moieties, our capability to spatiotemporally control their concentration distributions in the extracellular medium remains limited. This is especially the case for biofilms and microbiota, in which the microorganisms’ small length scales pose significant challenges for concentration modulation. The inadequate control of concentration heterogeneity limits our capability of mimicking the natural environments in vitro and investigating how local concentration gradients affect microbial functionality. Therefore, there is a need for an advanced method of controlling chemical concentrations at microscopic level.  Our proposed research aims to use electrochemical nano-/micro-electrodes to spatiotemporally control the concentration gradients in the extracellular medium. When an electrochemical reaction occurs on an electrode’s surface, a concentration gradient is established near the electrode. Taking advantages of this phenomena with the assistance of numerical simulation, we will employ an array of nano-/micro-electrodes with individually addressable electrochemical potentials to program any arbitrary spatiotemporal concentration profiles. We will fine-tune the surface chemistry and the electrochemical properties of these electrodes to ensure biocompatibility and reaction specificity. The developed system will be applied to biofilms and we aim to investigate how the microbial social behavior will be affected by a perturbation of local O2 concentration. Moreover, we will use this device to mimic the heterogenous environment in the gut and culture gut microbiota in vitro. An algorithm based on machine learning will be employed to actively adjust electrode potentials, maintaining a stable concentration profile despite the accumulation of gut microorganisms.  Ultimately, our work will expand our capability of controlling the concentration heterogeneity in nature. The developed electrochemical system will serve an in vitro platform to culture microorganisms in their native environment, or as a tool to perturb the concentration profiles. Combining electrochemistry, inorganic chemistry, and nanomaterials the research will enable a deeper understanding of the spatial distribution and temporal response of microbial systems. Project Narrative The natural environment is intrinsically heterogenous yet our control of concentrations for chemical species is limited at microscopic level. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of the NIH because it describes the development of technology that will expand our capability of controlling chemical concentration profiles in a variety of microbial systems relevant to the public health. The research described here will enable a deeper understanding of disease-related microbial systems and help to formulate strategies to combat diseases.",Spatiotemporal control of concentration gradients with electrochemistry in extracelluar space,10029526,R35GM138241,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Devices', 'Dioxygen', 'Disease', 'Electrochemistry', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Heterogeneity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Chemistry', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Microscopic', 'Mission', 'Nanoarray Analytical Device', 'Nature', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'System', 'Transition Elements', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'combat', 'extracellular', 'gut microbiota', 'microbial', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'microorganism culture', 'nano', 'nanomaterials', 'programs', 'response', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'technology development', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R35,2020,371084,0.11845415338342424
"Biophysical and Mechanistic Determinants for Cancer Cell Import of Hydrocarbon-Stapled Peptides PROJECT SUMMARY  Deregulated intracellular protein interactions mediate a complex network of pathologic signaling events that drive human cancer. The development of drugs to modulate the large, flat, and complex interfaces of oncogenic signaling proteins remains a formidable challenge and has inspired alternative approaches to traditional small molecule discovery. Although the very peptide structures that define the molecular handshakes between proteins are ideally suited to modulate such signaling events, structured peptides in the context of a protein typically lose their bioactive shape when isolated from the whole. We previously developed hydrocarbon-stapled peptides that recapitulate the natural shape of -helical interaction motifs by insertion of chemical crosslinks. Stapled peptides are structurally-stable, protease-resistant, and retain the capacity to engage their biological targets with natural potency and specificity. Unexpectedly, select stapled -helical peptides are also cell- permeable, opening the door to an entirely new modality for dissecting and potentially drugging pathologic protein interactions in cancer. However, despite a decade of progress in the creation of new research tools to investigate and target disease-causing proteins, the true promise of structured peptides as a novel therapeutic platform for cancer has been hampered by our very limited understanding of two fundamental questions: (1) What biophysical properties dictate whether a stapled peptide will be taken up by a cancer cell? (2) What is the explicit molecular mechanism of cellular import and intracellular release for cell-permeable stapled peptides? The answers to these questions not only carry the potential to transform these research tools and prototype therapeutics into an arsenal of bona fide cancer drugs, but will also provide critical new insight into the essential cellular process of vesicle transport. For example, certain cancer cells enforce metabolic immortality by upregulating protein nutrient uptake via the pinocytosis import pathway – a mechanism that could be leveraged to achieve a therapeutic window for structured peptide-based cancer drugs. Here, I propose a two-pronged research plan that harnesses our deep experience with stapled peptide design and application, but diverges from our traditional protein targeting research to instead focus on the why and how distinct stapled peptides access the intracellular environment. To achieve our goals, we will (1) employ biostatistical and computational methods to glean what biophysical parameters confer cellular penetrance among our libraries of stapled peptides, and (2) perform a genome-wide CRISPR-based screen to identify and then vet those cellular components that alternatively impair and enhance the import pathway for stapled peptides. By integrating our laboratory’s foundation in the chemical biology of oncogenic protein interactions with the proposed biostatistical, CRISPR screening, and cancer cell import validation studies, we hope to break new ground in our understanding of just how stapled peptides and their uptake mechanisms can be harnessed for therapeutic benefit in cancer.

We aim to address these two fundamental questions using multidisciplinary approaches, which include synthetic, biophysical, computational, and CRISPR screening methods, and translate the fresh insights into the design of stapled peptide therapeutics that efficiently penetrate and neutralize human cancer cells.",Biophysical and Mechanistic Determinants for Cancer Cell Import of Hydrocarbon-Stapled Peptides,9178990,R21CA209358,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'BCL1 Oncogene', 'BCL2 gene', 'BCL2L11 gene', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'EZH2 gene', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'High Pressure Liquid Chromatography', 'Human', 'Hydrocarbons', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Nutrient', 'Oncogenic', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetrance', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pinocytosis', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Son of Sevenless Proteins', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Targeted Research', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Vesicle Transport Pathway', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'crosslink', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'drug development', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'novel therapeutics', 'peptide drug', 'peptide structure', 'prototype', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'uptake', 'validation studies']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2016,190313,0.045342276017891536
"A Machine-Learning Based Software Widget for Resolving Metabolite Identities Owing to recent technological advances in measurement platforms, it is now possible to simultaneously detect and characterize a very large number of metabolites covering a substantial fraction of the small molecules present in a biological sample. This presents an exciting opportunity to develop potentially transformative approaches to study cells and organisms. One major challenge in realizing this potential lies in processing and analyzing the data. A typical dataset from an untargeted experiment contains many of thousands of “features,” each of which could correspond to a unique metabolite. Analyzing such datasets to obtain meaningful biological information depends on reliably and efficiently resolving the chemical identities of the detected features. Currently, in silico fragmentation methods predict candidate metabolites that are scored and ranked based on how well the fragmentation explains the observed MS/MS spectrum, and on other factors influencing fragmentation such as bond dissociation energies and ionization conditions. Deciding which candidate metabolites is the best match for a particular feature in the context of the biological sample, however, is a daunting task. Extensive testing of candidate metabolites against chemical standards library may be prohibitive in terms of cost and efforts. We seek to develop software-enabled workflows centered on resolving metabolite identities. Our approach is to exploit knowledge of the biological context of a sample to identify the metabolites. Recognizing that the metabolites present in a sample result from enzyme-catalyzed biochemical reactions active in the corresponding biological system, we employ topological analysis and inference to best map the metabolites implied by the detected features to metabolic pathways that are feasible based on the genome(s) of cells in the biological system. Aim 1 develops a computational method based on Bayesian-inference to enhance candidate metabolite rankings that are obtained via in silico fragmentation analysis. Our method utilizes all available information (database lookups, in silico fragmentation analysis, and network/pathway context) to maximally inform and adjust the rankings. Aim 2 will build software widgets to implement the metabolite identification workflow within a data-analytics framework. As the analytics framework, we will use Orange, which allows the user to create interactive data analysis pipelines through a plug-and-play graphical user interface (GUI). Aim 3 will validate the computational method and software widget implementation. Experimental validation will utilize high-purity standards to confirm (or reject) the computationally assigned metabolite identities. Widget implementation will be evaluated through a focus group discussion with the widget users in the labs directed by the PIs. As project outcomes, we anticipate both a methodological advance in analyzing mass signature data as well as a suite of easily accessible software in the form of widgets. Metabolomics is concerned with the comprehensive characterization of the small molecule metabolites in biological systems. Owing to recent technological advances in measurement platforms, it is now possible to simultaneously detect and characterize a very large number of metabolites. Prospectively, advanced computational tools and software for metabolomics data analysis can aid discovery efforts aimed at identifying novel bioactive metabolites that could be developed into diagnostic indicators or therapeutic agents. ",A Machine-Learning Based Software Widget for Resolving Metabolite Identities,9223450,R03CA211839,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dissociation', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Oranges', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'base', 'biological systems', 'chemical standard', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'database query', 'flexibility', 'functional outcomes', 'graphical user interface', 'heuristics', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'instrument', 'ionization', 'mass spectrometer', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'research study', 'small molecule', 'software development']",NCI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R03,2016,147569,0.03808006595238056
"Ion mobility based informatics and visualization strategies in support of metabolomics Project Summary  Metabolites are building blocks of cellular function, thus understanding the mechanisms that underlie various physiological conditions and processes will provide insight into disease or aberrant states. Innovative developments in high-throughput analytical technologies and data analysis have allowed for systems-level metabolomics analyses to be performed, many of these technologies have centered around mass spectrometry. The diverse chemical structures in the human metabolome exhibit a wide range of concentration, solubility, polarity and volatility with highly diverse structural forms and physiochemical properties as well as a high number of isomers, therefore the need for as many orthogonal separations as possible is necessary for metabolomics experiments (i.e., multidimensional data sets). Mass spectrometry approaches incorporating liquid chromatography ion mobility mass spectrometry (LC-IM-MS/MS) analyses have shown utility for global untargeted metabolic profiling experiments. Since ion mobility coupled to mass spectrometry (IM-MS) is a relatively new commercially available technology, the incorporation of the ion mobility measurement (via collision cross section, CCS) into current metabolomics data analysis identification strategies is minimal. The typical analytical use of ion mobility is as a quick chemical separation (which allows for noise reduction, increase in peak capacity, etc.), however IM can also be used to increase the confidence in identification and characterization because CCS provides structure specific information about individual metabolites. The long term objectives of this proposal are all centered around incorporating IM measurements into metabolomics based chemoinformatic and bioinformatics pipelines. These include: (1) determining the extent at which the ion mobility dimension can address molecular specificity of isomeric metabolites, (2) developing an IM-based library using CCS values as a descriptor to screen and assign identities to unknown metabolites and lastly, (3) incorporating visualization tools for navigating multidimensional datasets which will allow scientists to better uncover relationships between metabolites and human health. Molecular specificity of the IM dimension will be addressed by analyzing previously generated IM-MS data from a commercially available metabolite library (>600 primary metabolites, of which >20% are isomeric). Individual metabolites in the metabolite library will also be interrogated for curation of the CCS library and these values will be used in the molecular identification pipeline for global untargeted metabolite studies generated previously. Lastly, multidimensional self-organizing maps will be utilized to visualize and navigate various dimensions of data (LC, CCS, m/z, etc.) and ultimately allow the user to prioritize and identify with high confidence metabolites indicative of disease state. Accomplishing the aims outlined in this proposal will be seen as overcoming several critical barriers which have so far hindered the routine and widespread use of ion mobility in MS-based metabolomics workflows. Project Narrative  The innovative developments described in the proposal incorporate high-throughput metabolomics technologies, big data informatics, and multidimensional visualization strategies which will allow scientists to uncover relationships between metabolites and human health using systems-level metabolomics analyses. Specifically, we believe these goals can be accomplished by overcoming several critical barriers to adopting new technologies based on multidimensional mass spectrometry which hold promise for furthering our knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems. Strategies outlined in this proposal include, providing a highly annotated library incorporating empirical ion mobility based collision cross section values (inclusive also of exact mass, fragment ion data, and retention time) and developing novel big data and visualization strategies to improve throughput and confidence in metabolite annotations.",Ion mobility based informatics and visualization strategies in support of metabolomics,9433378,R03CA222452,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cell physiology', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Mail', 'Exhibits', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Ions', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phonation', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Solubility', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'data visualization', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interest', 'ion mobility', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'professor', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R03,2017,151533,0.04842870440462628
"Quantitative SRS Imaging of Cancer Metabolism at Single Cell Level Project summary: Although altered cell metabolism is becoming an established hallmark of cancer, there remains a crucial need of new tools for quantitation of metabolites at single living cell level. In particular, due to lack of specific labels for metabolites, there is an unmet need for high-resolution imaging tools capable of mapping metabolites and small molecules (fatty acids, carbohydrates, amino acids) that play essential roles in pathogenesis of cancer. Supported by a R21 grant through the IMAT program, our team partially addressed this need via developing a multiplex stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscope, which enabled vibrational imaging of metabolites in live tumor cells and intact biopsies at the speed of 5 microseconds per spectrum. This R33 application aims to push the hyperspectral stimulated Raman imaging technology to the next level through (i) technical simplification and validation, (ii) developing a robust hyperspectral image segmentation framework, and (iii) integrating the SRS modality with a commercial spontaneous Raman microscope towards broad use by non-experts.

"Support for Preparation of National Toxicology (NTP) Nomination Background Inform The goal of this contract is to provide support of National Toxicology Program (NTP) hazard identification activities targeted toward the prevention of diseases or adverse effects caused by environmental exposure to chemical or physical agents. To carry out its mission to evaluate environmental substances of public health concern by developing and applying tools of modern toxicology and molecular biology, the NTP organizes and conducts a comprehensive research and testing program focused on determining potential human health hazards of exposures to chemical, biological or physical substances or mixtures of substances. The nomination and selection of substances for study by the NTP is critical to the effective long-term operation of the program and helps to ensure that NTP resources are being used to address priority public health needs. Within the NIEHS, the NTP Office of Nomination and Selection serves as the focal point for coordinating the nomination and selection process and providing supporting documentation for the evaluation and selection of substances nominated for study. This contract provides administrative and scientific support for the preparation of information materials and background documents on substances or issues under consideration for toxicological study by the NTP. Substances evaluated by the NTP include chemical, physical and biological agents to which humans are likely to be exposed and for which there is inadequate toxicity information to accurately estimate potential human health hazards and risks. The contractor utilizes public and proprietary databases and other information sources to comprehensively search and identify the existing information on substances under consideration. The data and information gathered in the literature searches are used to prepare brief summaries of the literature identified and a written review document (Toxicological Summary Report) containing information on physical and chemical properties, production levels and processes, uses, human exposure, regulatory status, human and environmental health effects, experimental toxicology studies, and structure-activity relationships. These reports are used in the formal open public process for the review and selection of substances for study by the NTP and for the design of NTP toxicology studies. Specifically, the reports are provided as supporting documents to each committee in the nomination review process (Interagency Committee for Chemical Evaluation and Coordination [ICCEC], NTP Board of Scientific Counselors, and the NTP Executive Committee). The supporting documents are made publicly available via the NTP web site during the nomination review process (e.g. see http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/34146) and are subsequently maintained on the NTP web site as nomination background information (e.g. see http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/18546). The information and documents developed though this contract, along with the data generated by the various NTP research and testing programs, are also used in the preparation of NTP Technical Reports.

"NICEATM Support Contract: Base Contract This is a Research and Development (R&D) contract to provide scientific and administrative support for the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM). NICEATM research supports activities of NTP in general, and specifically, NTP’s Biomolecular Screening Branch (BSB), the Tox21 consortium, and the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM). NICEATM is responsible for ensuring compliance with the duties and provisions of the ICCVAM Authorization Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 285l-3) - to promote the research, development, validation, evaluation, acceptance, and use of new and alternative testing methods and strategies that are more predictive of human health and ecological effects than currently available methods and strategies. NICEATM carries out its mission by performing independent R&D activities, reviewing proposed test methods, organizing workshops and meetings, and facilitating peer reviews.  The Contractor is required to acquire and apply new and existing scientific knowledge to develop, evaluate, and validate novel computational approaches that can be used for chemical hazard identification and risk assessment with direct relevance to human health. Data development, analysis, and evaluation represents a large portion of the work of this requirement. These approaches include, but are not limited to: exposure modeling, physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) modeling, reverse toxicokinetic (R-TK) modeling, Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling, analysis of quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) and high content (HC) data, and development of novel Integrated Testing and Decision Strategies (ITDS) using in vivo, in vitro and/or in silico systems. The Contractor routinely utilizes information from diverse data types and multiple databases (e.g., ToxRef DB, ToxCastDB, ExpoCastDB, DSSTox, CEBS, etc.) to develop and evaluate the above listed approaches. The Contractor develops Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs), in accordance with guidelines proposed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)3, for novel AOPs of interest to Federal agencies. The Contractor analyzes the performance characteristics of the proposed AOPs in the context of emerging scientific literature and novel computational approaches.  To explore the utility of alternative methods, the Contractor identifies, retrieves, and compares data generated from novel methods with extant data from traditional methods found in the published literature.

"NICEATM Support Contract: Meeting Support This is a Research and Development (R&D) contract to provide scientific and administrative support for the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM). NICEATM research supports activities of NTP in general, and specifically, NTP’s Biomolecular Screening Branch (BSB), the Tox21 consortium, and the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM). NICEATM is responsible for ensuring compliance with the duties and provisions of the ICCVAM Authorization Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 285l-3) - to promote the research, development, validation, evaluation, acceptance, and use of new and alternative testing methods and strategies that are more predictive of human health and ecological effects than currently available methods and strategies. NICEATM carries out its mission by performing independent R&D activities, reviewing proposed test methods, organizing workshops and meetings, and facilitating peer reviews.  The Contractor is required to acquire and apply new and existing scientific knowledge to develop, evaluate, and validate novel computational approaches that can be used for chemical hazard identification and risk assessment with direct relevance to human health. Data development, analysis, and evaluation represents a large portion of the work of this requirement. These approaches include, but are not limited to: exposure modeling, physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) modeling, reverse toxicokinetic (R-TK) modeling, Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling, analysis of quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) and high content (HC) data, and development of novel Integrated Testing and Decision Strategies (ITDS) using in vivo, in vitro and/or in silico systems. The Contractor routinely utilizes information from diverse data types and multiple databases (e.g., ToxRef DB, ToxCastDB, ExpoCastDB, DSSTox, CEBS, etc.) to develop and evaluate the above listed approaches. The Contractor develops Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs), in accordance with guidelines proposed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)3, for novel AOPs of interest to Federal agencies. The Contractor analyzes the performance characteristics of the proposed AOPs in the context of emerging scientific literature and novel computational approaches.  To explore the utility of alternative methods, the Contractor identifies, retrieves, and compares data generated from novel methods with extant data from traditional methods found in the published literature. Using public and proprietary databases, the Contractor gathers all relevant production, use, exposure, and toxicological information on selected chemicals and mixtures currently included in or inder consideration for inclusion in Tox21-related efforts or of interest to the NTP. The Contractor reviews and evaluates the data and information gathered from the literature searches and prepares comprehensive written reports, as needed. In order to promote the research, development, validation, acceptance, and use of new and alternative testing methods and strategies, NICEATM supports ICCVAM-coordinates evaluations of submitted and nominated test methods by drafting supporting documentation for ICCVAM review, comment, and approval. In addition, NICEATM may be called upon to coordinate validation studies for emerging alternative approaches.
