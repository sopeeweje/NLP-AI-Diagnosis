"DNA PATTERN IDENTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS We will continue our development of methods for recognizing and                  representing functional domains in biological sequences.  This                   includes methods to identify regulatory sites in DNA starting                    from unaligned sequences, and to develop models that will allow                  new sites to be accurately predicted.  This will involve the                     adoption of better statistical models so that the most                           significant alignments can be more readily obtained.  We will                    also develop improved methods for recognizing functional motifs                  in RNA sequences that are composed of both sequence and                          structure.  These methods will be useful for identifying                         regulatory domains that operate post-transcriptionally, and also                 for determining the common motifs in RNAs selected in vitro for                  particular activities.  And we will further enhance methods for                  representing conserved domains in protein families that new                      members of the families can be identified more reliably.

"The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes PROJECT SUMMARY - HGNC The core objective of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is to enable effective communication and data exchange between everyone with an interest in human genes, by providing a unique, concise and standardized gene symbol and name for every human gene. As usage of genomic data increases in healthcare the need for a consistent language for genes becomes ever more vital. Aim 1 of this proposal will ensure the continuity of standardized naming of novel human protein-coding genes, long and small non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and pseudogenes. In particular all putative novel protein coding loci will require careful consideration; as active members of the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) consortium, HGNC can ensure that named loci accurately reflect the current expert manual annotations provided by consortium members. Aim 2 concentrates on renaming newly characterized human genes that are currently assigned a placeholder symbol; some genes with a phenotype-based nomenclature will also be considered for reassignment. These updates will reflect functional information, aid name transferal to orthologous genes, and avoid confusion. This round of revision will be a precursor to a nomenclature freeze for the majority of protein coding genes. Aim 3 focusses on coordinating gene naming across vertebrates, collaborating with the six existing vertebrate gene nomenclature committees (mouse, rat, chicken, Anolis, Xenopus, zebrafish) which base their naming on human gene nomenclature. As the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) this effort will be extended to naming genes in vertebrates lacking a nomenclature authority, such as cow, dog and horse. Recent gene naming in chimpanzee enabled creation of the necessary tools, pipelines and databases required for naming in other species. Assignments will reflect homologous relationships to human genes. Aim 4 will investigate the utility of machine learning in automated assignment of systematic nomenclature to long ncRNA genes and vertebrate orthologs, and potentially to pseudogenes. Models will be trained on manually curated datasets to learn both explicit and implicit practices, and then applied at scale. Aim 5 will ensure consistent naming across vertebrates in complex and divergent gene families, which can reveal some of the most interesting evolutionary biology and account for key diversity between species, but require careful manual curation. HGNC will collaborate with experts to expand the successful gene naming in the pharmacologically relevant cytochrome P450 (CYP) family to further species, also working across species on two other complex key families involved in detoxification, the glutathione S-transferases (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). HGNC will also work with experts to expand gene naming of olfactory receptors, the largest vertebrate gene family, from mammals to other well- studied model organisms such as zebrafish, Xenopus and chicken. HGNC is the only group worldwide providing systematic and user-friendly names for genes that are used throughout biomedical science and clinical practice; this is a crucial facility, with increasing importance and direct benefits for public health. To ensure effective communication between basic and clinical researchers, practicing clinicians and patients, there has to be a consistent well managed set of names for all human genes, which HGNC has provided since 1979. Having these names enables new discoveries, avoids confusion and prevents patient harm, by helping to ensure that everyone refers to a given gene using the same name.",The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes,9937764,U24HG003345,"['Animal Model', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cattle', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ensure', 'Equus caballus', 'Family', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Transfer', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Glucuronosyltransferase', 'Glutathione S-Transferase', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Nomenclature', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pan Genus', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudogenes', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Study models', 'Syntenic Conservation', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'Zebrafish', 'authority', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'gene product', 'genomic data', 'human genomics', 'interest', 'member', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'olfactory receptor', 'parallelization', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vertebrate genome', 'web site']",NHGRI,EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY,U24,2020,550000,0.07411854608163462

"Bio-behavioral chronic disease management by families of young minority children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (09) Health Disparities and specific Challenge Topic 09-MD- 102 Trans-disciplinary Research to Integrate the Biological and Non-biological Determinants of Health to Address Health Disparities. Description ""Bio-behavioral chronic disease management by families of young minority children"" seeks to reduce health disparities by investigating methods to close the gap between health information and health behaviors- specifically, the gap between instruction provided by clinicians to families of young children with chronic diseases and the capacity of economically stressed families to act on that instruction. Whether addressing asthma, diabetes, obesity, or tooth decay, needed now is trans-disciplinary translational research that tailors pharmacological and behavioral interventions to care management plans that parents are able to implement successfully. Envisioned is a computer ""Tool"" for use in community sites that assists community health workers in collaboration with families to: (1) determine children's level of risk for chronic diseases, (2) match them to clinicians and care plans, (3) characterize a family's capacity to engage in such plans, and (4) modify care plans to meet family's capacities. Target families are those disadvantaged by low-income, low-literacy, cultural barriers and minority status. Specific research aims are to develop, pilot test, and refine two ""Instruments"" that are integral to this Tool: (1) a 'disease risk assessment instrument' and (2) a culturally adaptable 'family capacity assessment instrument.' Early childhood caries (""ECC"") was selected as the exemplar chronic disease for this research by an existing 12-member multi-disciplinary Project Team comprised of social and behavioral scientists, clinicians, educational and informatics technologists, and health services researchers. ECC was selected because it is highly prevalent in young children, because preventive and therapeutic bio- behavioral therapies are available but underused, and because significant cost savings may accrue to governmental programs, insurers, and families if the need for dental repair can be reduced. The proposed 'disease risk assessment instrument' will experiment with inputting recognized biological (clinical, laboratory, psychological, and pharmacologic), and non biological (knowledge, logistic, socio-cultural, and environmental) risk factors into algorithm-supported ""classification and regression tree analyses"" and machine learning ""artificial neural networks"" to improve on current professionally-endorsed methods of classifying young children by risk. As the proposed 'family capacity assessment instrument' has been less developed to date by the Project Team, its ultimate form will be determined by this research. Success in developing and implementing the Tool and its two assessment Instruments can result in better oral health outcomes at lower cost through risk-based early intervention, disease suppression, individualized care, family engagement, and elimination of the need for dental surgery in children under the age of six. Findings of this research will support clinical trials of risk-based caries management in vulnerable minority child populations and is adaptable to management of other chronic diseases in young children.

"Comparison of Protein Sequences and Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goals of our research are: (a) to develop more sensitive and reliable methods for exploiting sequence and structure information through similarity searching; and (b) to understand better the biophysical constraints on protein folding that can be identified from protein sequence information. Although similarity searching is now routinely used to characterize sequences and annotate genomes, the most widely used methods focus on speed at the expense of sensitivity and statistical accuracy. We believe that more flexible algorithms, with more accurate statistical estimates, can provide new biological insights about the structure, function, and evolutionary history of protein and DMA sequences. Over the next five years, our specific aims are: (1) To improve the FASTA programs by: providing better performance on parallel (Beowulf) clusters; using vector-parallel instruction sets, and providing more accurate statistics. (2) To develop evolutionary calibrated DMA sequence comparison algorithms using rapid initial seeding, followed by extension using context dependent scoring matrices. The goal is to develop heuristic approaches with well understood evolutionary horizons. (3) To develop improved strategies for identifying repeated sequences in proteins by combining optimal local alignment strategies with appropriate scoring matrices and gap penalties, (4) To develop accurate statistical estimates for profile: sequence and profile: profile similarity searches. Profile: profile comparison programs with accurate statistical estimates should substantially reduce the sensitivity gap between sequence and structure comparison. Profile: profile comparisons will both be far more useful, and allow us to explore fundamental questions about how easy it is for new protein families to emerge. (5) We will examine local sequence constraints in proteins, using each family as an independent observation. We believe that much of the literature on the global properties of protein sequences fails to distinguish between correlations that reflect genuine biophysical constraints, and correlations that reflect shared evolutionary history. We will also search for clear examples of convergent evolution-similar functions carried out by clearly non-homologous proteins. Accurate statistical estimates for searches with real protein sequences, and profiles from real protein families, can change fundamentally the inference of homology from statistically significant similarity. Because of inaccurate statistical estimates, similarity searching is often considered a tool for generating hypotheses about homology, which must be confirmed experimentally. When the statistical estimates are highly accurate, it may become possible to define homology in terms of statistically significant similarity.           n/a",Comparison of Protein Sequences and Structures,7096765,R01LM004969,"['artificial intelligence', 'biochemical evolution', 'chemical information system', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'protein sequence', 'protein structure', 'statistics /biometry']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,R01,2006,333081,0.04946116776650741

Although            similarity searching is now a routine first step in the characterization of          newly determined sequences, we believe that additional improvements in               similarity searching methods will allow investigators to look back more deeply       in evolutionary time.  Moreover, as complete protein sequence sets become            available for more organisms, sequence information can be exploited more             effectively for functional genomics and traditional biochemical problems.  The       availability of complete genome sequences, combined with reliable and                sensitive sequence comparison algorithms, also allows us to test hypotheses          about the possible emergence of novel proteins over the past 200-1,200 million       years.  Over the next five years, our specific aims are: (1) To extend the           average look-back time provided by protein sequence similarity searching.  We        propose improvements to the scoring methods and statistics analysis of               similarity scores that seek to push back the protein similarity-search horizon       from 1.5-2-fold, to more than 2,000 million years for most protein families.         (2) To develop a higher performance, more flexible and user-friendly FASTA           package.  (3) To study repeated domains in proteins.  We will develop more           quantitative methods for identifying both simple sequence and long-period            repeats in proteins.  We will characterize the fraction of repeat-containing         proteins in proteomes, characterize the fraction of domain-structured proteins       that are not internally repetitive, and ask whether these proteins duplicate         or diverge with patterns that differ from ""normal"" single domain proteins.

"CLASSIFICATION NEURAL NETWORKS FOR GENOME RESEARCH The long-term objective is to develop computer technology needed to              accomplish the objectives of the Human Genome Project and to apply the           technology to the analysis and management of sequencing data.  Currently,        a database search for sequence similarities represents the most direct           computational approach to the analysis of genomic information.  However,         the search is becoming ever more forbidding due to the accelerating              growth of sequencing data.  The goal of the proposed research is to              further develop and enhance a software tool for speedy classification of         unknown sequences, and make it available to the genome community.  The           research will build upon a pilot system designed and developed by the            principal investigator that has shown great promise.  The specific aims          are (1) to enhance the tool for speedy identification of PIR                     superfamilies and ProSite patterns, (2) to develop a pilot DNA/RNA               classification system, (3) to distribute the tool, and (4) to aid PIR            protein database and RDP ribosomal RNA database organization.  In                contrast to other search methods whose search time grows linearly with           the number of entries in the database, the time of the proposed tool             grows with the number of families, which is likely to remain low.  The           tool would automate family assignment which is especially important for          managing the influx of new data in a timely manner.                                                                                                               The proposed research applies neural network technology to solving the           database search/organization problem.  The major design principles               involve an encoding schema to extract sequence information and a modular         architecture to scale up backpropagation networks.  The encoding                 algorithm is a hashing function similar to the k-tuple method.  A pilot          system has been implemented on a Cray supercomputer to classify electron         transfer proteins and enzymes.

The speed may be 1000 times         faster than others in a decade if the database continues to grow at the          current rate.  In the proposed research, the sensitivity of the tool             would be improved and a full-scale system would be developed.  The               automated software tool would be portable at the source code, user               interface, and hardware levels.

"Alignment-independent Classification of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Human Genome project and related genome projects have stirred great hopes for improving our understanding and treatment of diseases. Central to this process is the automated detection of functional motifs and classification of protein sequences into families and/or subfamilies. Conventional approaches for protein sequence classification usually employ sequence alignment methods; other methods depend on the choice of the features included in the training sets, and on accuracy and availability of data. We propose an alignment-independent classification approach based on a search engine technology that had been successfully used in classifying medical records. Each protein is represented by a multidimensional vector, the elements of which refer to the protein's most discriminative eta-grams (sequences of eta amino acids). Preliminary studies on G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) showed that a simple Naive Bayes classifier using straightforward eta-gram feature   selection in its preprocessing, can outperform existing classifiers including support vector machines on previously investigated, standardized GPCR sequence data subsets. Jackknife tests applied to the Protein Information Resource (PIR) Protein Sequence Database PSD and to the Pfam database (DB) of protein families showed that approximately 70% of the protein sequences are classified correctly.  More significantly, the most discriminative eta-grams in a given protein family appear to have a functional or structural role, as suggested by their comparison with the sequence motifs known to be conserved or active in existing DBs and by the examination of the three-dimensional structure of representative members of the family. Encouraged by these results, we propose to pursue the following specific aims:   (1) develop a new computational tool for protein sequence analysis and protein classification based on eta-gram distributions, (2) build a comprehensive DB of protein families based on eta-gram distributions and investigate the relationships between this DB and the leading protein classification DBs, (3) determine the functional significance of the top-ranking n-grams, and (4) develop a Java based toolkit that will provide easy-to-use, yet flexible, web interface to researchers from various background. The expected deliverables are the methodology and software for classification without alignment (CWA); a new database of classified proteins, based on CWA; and an on-line server and GUI that will deliver the database and data mining tools to the scientific community in a user-friendly environment.         n/a",Alignment-independent Classification of Proteins,7237368,R01LM007994,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Sequence Databases', 'Amino Acids', 'Biological', 'Case Study', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Information Resources', 'International', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Kindling (Neurology)', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Numbers', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Pilot Projects', 'Printing', 'Probability', 'Probability Theory', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Databases', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Sequence Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'Randomized', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Score', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'SwissProt', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data mining', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'interest', 'markov model', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'stem', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vector', 'web interface']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2007,264180,0.13424074386681578

"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This eMERGE III proposal builds on past discoveries and research designed to translate genomic advances into clinical care involving clinicians, patients and families. This phase focuses on traits associated with preventable health concerns: colon cancer, triglycerides, and immunity.

Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This eMERGE III proposal builds on past discoveries and research designed to translate genomic advances into clinical care involving clinicians, patients and families. This phase focuses on traits associated with preventable health concerns: colon cancer, triglycerides, and immunity. We address optimal methods to share information across families and whether other information found by genomic tests impact the care, health, and medical costs of individuals.","The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III",9564312,U01HG008657,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amendment', 'American', 'Asians', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Community Practice', 'Community of Practice', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Digital Libraries', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Immunity', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Libraries', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Other Genetics', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Social Impacts', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Triglycerides', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'economic outcome', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'online resource', 'outreach', 'polyposis', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2017,54232,0.12963911102994422

"OMOP information model for eMERGE phenotyping ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality.

Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality.

"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to identify susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of keratoconus (KC). We will achieve our goal by: 1) refining criteria for the early detection of KC using videokeratography and wavefront Zernike variables; 2) comprehensively testing genes under newly identified linkage peaks generated through genome wide linkage scans of KC families, and performing comprehensive positional candidate gene association studies; and 3) characterizing specific genetic variants that predispose an individual to developing KC. We will study a cohort comprising: normal controls, patients with 'early' KC, KC 'suspect', and KC relatives with videokeratography and aberrometry in order to determine the best combination of variables that discriminate KC 'suspects' from normals. Study subjects will be followed longitudinally to determine which combination of variables is predictive of progression to KC, and thus define subclinical KC (Aim 1). After genome-wide linkage scan of multiplex KC families, we identified regions with significant or suggestive linkage on chromosomes 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 14, confirmed by subsequent fine mapping studies. To follow-up these positive linkage findings, we will conduct a comprehensive positional candidate gene association study by testing all genes in these regions with tagSNPs. Any positive association results will be tested in an independent sample for confirmation (Aim 2). Additionally, using newly identified criteria for defining subclinical markers for KC (combination of videokeratography and aberrometry), we will refine our linkage analysis on families with KC in an attempt identify new linkage peaks which may encompass new potential candidate genes for study. Genes identified by both genetic association studies and expression studies published in the literature to date will be prioritized for further study to identify specific genetic variants that contribute to the susceptibility of KC (Aim 3).  Refining criteria for early detection of KC will provide the tools to prevent many patients from under- going unnecessary surgery and developing post-lasik ectasia, a significant public health issue. It will also facilitate identification of susceptibility genes for KC, which may provide an understanding of the mechanisms contributing to corneal thinning in KC.

Study subjects will be followed longitudinally to determine which combination of variables is predictive of progression to KC, and thus define subclinical KC (Aim 1). After genome-wide linkage scan of multiplex KC families, we identified regions with significant or suggestive linkage on chromosomes 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 14, confirmed by subsequent fine mapping studies. To follow-up these positive linkage findings, we will conduct a comprehensive positional candidate gene association study by testing all genes in these regions with tagSNPs. Any positive association results will be tested in an independent sample for confirmation (Aim 2). Additionally, using newly identified criteria for defining subclinical markers for KC (combination of videokeratography and aberrometry), we will refine our linkage analysis on families with KC in an attempt identify new linkage peaks which may encompass new potential candidate genes for study. Genes identified by both genetic association studies and expression studies published in the literature to date will be prioritized for further study to identify specific genetic variants that contribute to the susceptibility of KC (Aim 3).  Refining criteria for early detection of KC will provide the tools to prevent many patients from under- going unnecessary surgery and developing post-lasik ectasia, a significant public health issue. It will also facilitate identification of susceptibility genes for KC, which may provide an understanding of the mechanisms contributing to corneal thinning in KC. Ultimately, this work may improve our ability to treat KC and/or prevent the development of KC.          n/a",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,7568725,R01EY009052,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Keratoconus', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Relative (related person)', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Study Subject', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Videokeratographies', 'Work', 'aquaporin 5', 'case control', 'cohort', 'corneal epithelium', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'genetic association', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide linkage', 'improved', 'indexing', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2009,668551,0.03292839512809603

"ADVISOR FOR CAREGIVERS TO ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS DESCRIPTION (From Applicant's Abstract):  The goal of this research proposal is to produce ACAP, a personal computer based Advisor for Families and Caregivers of Alzheimer's and other Demented Patients. Utilizing expert system techniques, the system is intended to promote an understanding of dementia related disease processes, provide an overview of the medical, custodial care, financial, and legal problems normally encountered, and identify specific sources of national and local assistance.  Use by families and professional caregivers is envisioned at hospital education centers, nursing schools, teaching nursing homes, and Alzheimer's centers.  ACAP is considered an adjunct in existing educational tools. Comprehensive coverage of the entire range of problems is planned, with more extensive consideration of the financial management and legal aspects of the disease than is generally presented.  The system will be readily updatable, offer a flexible mechanism for probing deeper levels of information complexity (independent of, or determined by profile), allow hardcopy output of desired data, and provide a practical starting point for obtaining assistance in all problem areas.  Simplicity and flexibility of human interface and information interrogation mechanisms will be emphasized.  n/a",ADVISOR FOR CAREGIVERS TO ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS,3487954,R43AG009712,"[""Alzheimer's disease"", ' artificial intelligence', ' caregivers', ' computer assisted instruction', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' dementia', ' health care cost /financing', ' health care model', ' health care personnel education', ' health economics', ' health related legal', ' information systems', ' mental health services', ' pathologic process']",NIA,ATLANTIC MICROSYSTEMS INC.,R43,1992,50000,0.0029117543804120212
"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups. The hidden group models and metrics will be embedded in analysis methods, and then evaluated by TB experts. The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.          n/a",Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data,7805478,R01LM009731,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Boxing', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Gender', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guadeloupe', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phylogeny', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Restriction fragment length polymorphism', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder control', 'family genetics', 'fight against', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'global health', 'improved', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health research', 'relational database', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NLM,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2010,339537,0.09261620360599537

"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups.

"Scalable tools to effectively translate genomic discoveries into the clinic PROJECT SUMMARY We are in the midst of a genomic revolution; more than 250,000 human genomes have been sequenced, generating over a petabase of genomic data. While these new data hold great promise to impact health, there is a disconnect between genomic discovery and clinical care. Providers frequently misinterpret genomic information, patients often don't understand their own test results, and genomic information about disease risk is infrequently shared between patients and family members. Importantly, ineffective communication and data misinterpretation has devastating consequences- including unnecessary organ removal, missed disease prevention opportunities, and premature death. We are addressing these genomic care gaps by developing and testing tools that optimize the integration of whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing (WES, WGS) for general clinical practice. My vision for improving genomic medicine is based on my work within multidisciplinary consortia and addresses the National Human Genome Research Institute's priority research area of improving the effectiveness of healthcare. In the proposed work we will test the effectiveness of a multilevel genomic e-Health intervention in cancer (Aim 1). Our intervention 1) educates physicians and patients about genomics, 2) enables direct-to-patient return-of- results, 3) provides physicians with patient-specific results and resources for interpretation, and 4) facilitates sharing of genomic results within families. We hypothesize that intervention use will result in higher rates of uptake of high-quality, genetically guided care. We will test our hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial among academic and community physicians who use WES for their patients. Next, we will use an iterative process, with stakeholder engagement, to adapt and pilot test our tool for Spanish and Mandarin speaking patients and for patients who have diabetes (Aim 2). Finally, we will create and assess new, moderated, social networks as a platform for genomic information sharing (Aim 3). Our hypothesis is that providers, patients and family members will engage with the genomic information sharing social networks and find them to be highly useful. Our general approach includes 1) creating the secure social networks, 2) integrating the networks into our e-Health intervention, and 3) using complementary methods, such as interviews and natural language processing, to assess stakeholders' network-related attitudes and network information quality. If successful, we will be well positioned to widely disseminate our e-Health tools. In sum, this work stands to transform how people obtain, process and share genomic information in the context of clinical care. Our tools reconceive genetic communication to allow for multi-directional flow of information, connects multiple stakeholders with one another, and integrates high-quality dynamic web-based resources to improve genomic care. In creating and deploying tools that both respond to and leverage the complexities of our information environment, we intend to transform genomic research and clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE/ RELEVANCE OF PROJECT TO RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH Widespread utilization of genomic sequencing in medicine creates an urgent need to educate providers and patients. Currently, providers frequently misinterpret genomic information and patients often don't understand their own test results.

"Polygenic Risk Scores for Healthier African American Families PROJECT ABSTRACT  To advance the health and care of children, as in eMERGE II & III, CCHMC will assemble a birth cohort in eMERGE IV, ascertained on pregnant or recently delivered self-identified African-American (AA) women and their babies, along with the willing fathers and siblings. The eMERGE IV collection will be the inaugural effort in a new CCHMC initiative, a birth cohort of mother and baby dyads called My Genome and Me, Cincinnati (MGMC), conceived to develop an understanding of the genomics that informs health and disease risk, beginning at birth and continuing across the lifespan with dyads randomized at enrollment to genotyping with return of results as neonates or later as older children. Our eMERGE IV project will directly grapple with the ethical issues raised by return of results to families with different considerations operating in babies, siblings and parents regarding the particular phenotypes being studied. For eMERGE IV, as site-specific phenotypes, we nominate Asthma, Atopic Dermatitis, Obesity, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Prematurity, and Breast Cancer. We will exploit the work done that will enable developing polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and genomic risk estimates (GREs) for these conditions in addition to the 15 others chosen by the eMERGE IV Network and anticipate developing consensus across the Network for the PRSs and GREs applied. The care of families will exploit the harmonization of the electronic health records between the adult and pediatric hospitals, which has been achieved with the Maternal and Infant Data Hub (MIDH) using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. For data quality control we will evaluate discrepancies between eMERGE IV genotyping and low read depth coverage (LRDC) genotypes (LRDC sequencing will be at CCHMC expense.) We will collect preferences and attitudes of our local AA community with respect to genomic results and return of results. We will develop health risk-reducing recommendations and return GREs with and without actionable PRSs to assess the influence of PRSs on the adherence to risk-mitigating recommendations. We will use SMART on FHIR (Substitutable Medical Applications, Reusable Technologies and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource) through the electronic health record (EHR)-integrated clinical decision support (CDS)-Hooks framework to provide CDS to both the adult and pediatric EHR systems. We will periodically revise PRSs and GREs and return changes when indicated. CCHMC will provide LRDC sequencing from >17,000 DNA AA samples from children in the CCHMC biobank and ≥50,000 subjects in total for genotype generation and mitochondrial DNA variant analysis. Federated geocoding will be available to all eMERGE IV sites from CCHMC. To disseminate genomic practice within CCHMC, across the Network, and in general, CCHMC will provide services to advance PRSs and GREs for specific conditions, starting with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, migraine headache, and suicide. In sum, CCHMC presents an aggressive program use genomic medicine to advance toward better health outcomes focused on underserved AA dyads of neonates and mothers with their families. Project Narrative Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) proposes to join eMERGE IV by enrolling of local Cincinnati African-American newborn babies and their mothers with available fathers and brothers and sisters to develop predictions of their risk for Asthma, Atopic Dermatitis, Obesity, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Prematurity, and Breast Cancer (along with 15 disorders chosen by the eMERGE IV Network and disorders chosen by CCHMC Faculty) using genetic variation, environmental factors, and family history. We will test whether knowledge of having a higher genetic risk for these disorders will motivate closer adherence to health recommendations made to reduce disease risk.",Polygenic Risk Scores for Healthier African American Families,9988603,U01HG011172,"['7 year old', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent Psychiatry', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Ancillary Study', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Attitude', 'Birth', 'Brothers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Repository', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethical Issues', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Fathers', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Fetus', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Mothers', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Siblings', 'Sister', 'Site', 'Suicide', 'Sum', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biobank', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'data hub', 'data modeling', 'data quality', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'minority subjects', 'neonate', 'polygenic risk score', 'preference', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'programs', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool']",NHGRI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,U01,2020,1338768,0.00876685591076929
"Effects of Lead on Calcium-Binding Proteins in Rats    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major long-term objectives of the proposed research are [1] to test the hypothesis that lead interacts with calcium binding proteins of the C2 and annexin families, and [2] to identify genes and proteins of these calcium-binding families that are regulated following lead exposure of rats. Lead poisoning remains a pervasive problem in the United States, affecting at least 5% of all children. The proposed research is intended to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying lead toxicity. Previous studies have demonstrated potent interactions between lead and proteins of the C2 domain family (e.g. protein kinase C and synaptotagmin) and annexins. Furthermore, lead exposure of cells has been shown to regulate the expression of genes encoding calcium-binding annexins. The four specific aims of this proposal are [1] to measure the interactions of lead with proteins of the C2 domain and annexin families, in order to determine the possible targets of lead. [2] To measure gene expression in the brain, kidney and liver of lead-exposed rats. This in vivo model may reveal whether lead exposure differentially regulates the expression of genes encoding calcium-binding proteins. [3] To extend gene expression studies to well characterized cell lines (astrocytes, PC12 cells, fibroblasts and normal rat kidney cells). These studies will complement gene expression measurements from the in vivo model. [4] To deposit gene expression data into a publicly accessible database. Together these studies may reveal which calcium binding proteins interact with lead, and which genes encoding calcium-binding proteins are regulated by lead exposure.         n/a",Effects of Lead on Calcium-Binding Proteins in Rats,7216675,R01ES012191,"['Affect', 'Annexin A1', 'Annexins', 'Astrocytes', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'C2 Domain', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Binding', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Class', 'Complement', 'Condition', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Divalent Cations', 'Environmental Health', 'Family', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'In Vitro', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Lead Poisoning', 'Liver', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Molecular', 'Northern Blotting', 'PC12 Cells', 'Pattern', 'Phospholipase A2', 'Phospholipids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Proteins', 'Rat Cell Line', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'annexin A5', 'base', 'calreticulin', 'cell type', 'cellular targeting', 'frontal lobe', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'kidney cell', 'lead exposure', 'member', 'neurotoxicity', 'neurotransmitter release', 'pup', 'repository', 'response', 'second messenger', 'sensor', 'statistics', 'synaptotagmin']",NIEHS,HUGO W.

"First Person Vision for Objective Evaluation of Caregiving Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 40 million family members provide informal care to older individuals annually, making them an essential component of the health care system in the US. Almost 11 million Americans provide unpaid care for a person with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. Health care professionals typically rely heavily on self-report by family members to understand the dynamics of the caregiving dyad, the quality of caregiving, and the impact of dementia on everyday life. Though invaluable, this information may be devoid of context, or biased due to caregiver reticence or imperfect recall. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to understand the challenges of caregiver/care-recipient interactions, and caregivers' responsiveness to clinicians' suggestions for handling difficult caregiving challenges. Equipped with tiny sensors and worn on eyeglasses or clothing, FPV devices capture video and sound within the user's field of view. These devices can document actual interaction, permit identification of antecedent circumstances or consequences, and provide the basis for targeted intervention designed to assure safe interactions and to prevent, eliminate, or ameliorate distressing care-recipient behaviors. This project with caregiving dyads aims: to describe the feasibility, usability, and interpretability of FPV device use at home (Aim 1); to explore the effect of nurse- delivered intervention, informed by FPV data, on reducing problem behaviors and caregiver burden when delivered in person within 2 weeks (Aim 2) or delivered by phone in ""near real-time,"" that is, within 1 hour, of problem behavior events (Aim 3); and to develop algorithms for an automated system capable of generating real-time Machine Learning responses that promote effective handling of problem behaviors (Aim 4). This project will involve 40 caregiving dyads comprising family caregivers age 21 or older who experience these problem behaviors and care-recipients age 50 or older with moderate to severe dementia (MMSE score <18) due to Alzheimer's disease, frontal temporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, or vascular dementia. Baseline data will include demographic, health, and caregiving information including problem behaviors, functional status, and attitudes toward technology. Caregivers among the first 20 dyads will wear two FPV devices during waking hours over 7 days and signal when the care-recipient takes medications and engages in problematic behavior. Within 2 weeks the caregiver will be shown video clips of his or her FPV data as part of a nurse- delivered intervention focused on handling problem behaviors, then wear the FPV devices for another 7 days and receive brief telephone contact to reinforce the intervention, which we anticipate will reduce problem behaviors and caregiver burden. This pilot intervention study will be replicated with the second 20 dyads, though the nurse will access FPV data remotely and intervene by phone within 1 hour of problem events. FPV data gathered in these investigations will be used to develop algorithms for an innovative, automated tool for objective assessment and timely, tailored intervention aimed at improving caregiving quality and safety.        Family caregivers often find it difficult to deal with the agitation, resistance, and repetitive behaviors of their family members with moderate or severe dementia, and they frequently ask health care professionals how to handle these difficult interactions. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to providing health care professionals with objective evidence of caregiving quality and responsiveness to recommended strategies for dealing with everyday problem behaviors. This project explores the use of FPV technology to assess specific interactions between caregivers and care-recipients, and it examines how FPV data can inform nurse-delivered intervention and provides the basis for development of an automated, intelligent assessment and intervention tool to reduce problem behaviors and decrease caregiver burden.

"A Genetic Study of GTS, OCD and ADHD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is a better understanding of the role of genetic and environmental factors in human neuropsychiatric disorders through the study of the Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GTS), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Recent research has led to several notable advances in our understanding of GTS, OCD, ADHD and related conditions. This research suggests that: 1) there are components of GTS, OCD and ADHD that represent distinct heritable phenotypes; 2) there are susceptibility genes of major effect that contribute to the expression of GTS, OCD, ADHD and related conditions; 3) there are DMA markers in several genomic regions linked to susceptibility genes for each of these disorders; and 4) some of those genomic regions overlap, suggesting that some genes may be contributing to the susceptibility of shared components of each of these conditions. Furthermore, the prevalence of GTS, OCD, ADHD and associated illnesses and their debilitating affects on those afflicted makes these conditions a major public health problem. Understanding the genetic factors important for the manifestation of these conditions will be of direct benefit to patients concerned about recurrence in their families; ultimately, clarifying the genetics of these conditions may elucidate their pathogenesis and lead to more effective interventions. Results from our ongoing analyses suggest that there is an etiologic relationship between GTS, OCD and some types of ADHD. In this application, we are proposing to collect additional data that will make it possible to characterize more completely the nature of the relationship between GTS, OCD, ADHD and related conditions. We propose to collect data from 700 families of ascertained individuals with GTS, OCD and ADHD. This data will allow a more complete delineation of the components of each disorder and allow a more complete examination of the genetic relationship between GTS, OCD and ADHD and their component parts. Data from these new family study samples should help identify specific genetic factors associated with the variable expression of GTS, OCD and ADHD and related behaviors.

"Identifying Electronic Phenotypes associated with Patient Health Outcomes of Interhospital Transfer Patients Project Summary/Abstract Approximately 1.6 million patients undergo interhospital transfer (IHT) each year in the United States. Of those IHTs, approximately 550,000 are conducted by air (i.e., helicopters or jets), or roughly one every 60 seconds, at an estimated annual cost of $6 billion. Contrary to common belief, patients who undergo IHT experience worse outcomes, which include double the length of stay, twice the cost, and higher mortality than non- transferred patients. While worse outcomes are not necessarily due to higher severity of illness, factors contributing to unfavorable outcomes have yet to be identified. For about 30% of the patients experiencing an immediately life-threatening condition such as trauma or heart attack, immediate IHT by air is beneficial; but for the other 70% of patients not experiencing a life-threatening condition, the benefit is less clear.  The current decision-making process regarding who should be transferred and how (air vs. ground) is rarely guided by evidence or guidelines. Furthermore, patients and families rarely have input regarding how a patient is transferred. Empirical evidence is needed to identify meaningful indicators for IHT and to guide the decision regarding mode of transfer. Previous research efforts relied almost exclusively on data from the post- transport phase of illness, a major limitation when investigating what leads up to a patient needing transfer to another hospital. To investigate the factors that lead to IHT, we developed a data repository for patients who are transported from one hospital to another. This repository includes the electronic medical record of helicopter and jet transfers, as well as the sending and receiving hospital EMR data.  The purpose of this study is to model complex patient-centered data that may predict those patients that will benefit from IHT by identifying pre-transport electronic phenotypes, and to determine who will benefit from air versus ground transfer. To fully leverage the data repository, this study will employ a data science approach that leverages statistical learning techniques to achieve the following aims: 1) Identify and rank specific combinations of comorbidities, active medical problems, and physiologic instability indicators according to frequency and impact on post-IHT mortality, and 2) Identify electronic phenotypes of IHT patients that benefit from air transfer according to health outcomes (hospital discharge status and functional status). After conducting exploratory data analysis and reducing variables with repeated measures, we will employ Association Rules to identify significant combinations of covariates to include in final model development (Aim 1). Then in Aim 2 we will use Random Forest to identify the most impactful variables from all of the available variables that will be analyzed via Classification and Regression Tree to identify distinct subgroups of patients that benefit from IHT by air transport. The individual characteristics identified from this data driven approach will provide the evidence needed to support future applications to develop clinical decision support for use by clinicians, patients, and families when making transfer decisions. Project Narrative Air Medical Transport (AMT), the use of helicopters and jets to transfer patients from one hospital to another, has been shown to save lives for patients with immediately life threatening conditions such as trauma or heart attack; for patients not experiencing an emergency, the impact of using AMT and transferring is unknown. To increase our understanding of the impact that AMT has for patients not experiencing an emergency, we will identify the patient characteristics and transport factors that improve patient survival after transport. Our study will be the first to provide evidence to support informed conversations between patients, families, and providers to guide those making the difficult decisions of if and how to transfer to another hospital.",Identifying Electronic Phenotypes associated with Patient Health Outcomes of Interhospital Transfer Patients,9515376,R15NR017792,"['Address', 'Air', 'Behavioral Model', 'Belief', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Helicopter', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypotension', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patient Transfer', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research', 'School Nursing', 'Severity of illness', 'Stroke', 'Students', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'experience', 'faculty support', 'forest', 'functional status', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'member', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'repository', 'support tools']",NINR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R15,2018,150000,0.02178243002599934
"Genetic Modulators of Glaucoma Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. While elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor, damage and death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) underlies visual field loss. However, a thorough understanding of this disease is a major challenge because its genetic basis is heterogeneous and it represents a family of age-related disorders resulting from intersecting gene-regulated pathophysiologic networks. We propose to continue to use the BXD (C57BL/6 x DBA/2J) family of recombinant inbred (RI) lines of mice as a genetic reference panel (GRP) and to combine our work with human genome wide association studies (GWAS), to uncover and clarify the genetic heterogeneity that underlies optic nerve (ON) damage. We have had recent success using this combined approach in the regulation of intraocular pressure (IOP). We are very well positioned to take the next step and apply this approach to define cellular targets of RGC damage and death. We propose to uncover phenotypic diversities of glaucoma-related ON damage and uncover common underlying mechanisms that are shared with IOP modulation. Our long-term research goal is to identify disease mechanisms and develop neuroprotective therapies to preserve retinal health in patients at risk for glaucoma. Our overall objective is to identify novel gene products and related mechanisms that lead to glaucomatous endophenotypes using multi-dimensional genetic analyses, cross-species comparisons (mouse, rat and human) and validation using novel murine glaucoma models. Our central hypothesis is that molecular processes leading to glaucoma associated-endophenotypes, such as elevated IOP and ON damage, are shared across species, and that species comparisons can uncover common underlying mechanisms, and efficient testing of targeted glaucoma therapeutics. In the current investigation, we perform a systematic analysis of ON damage, and an additional species—rat. We will mine the extensive databases of IOP and ON damage that we are generating for more than 70 BXD strains across five age cohorts with the goal of defining new models of glaucoma. An overall strength of this proposal is the combination of cutting-edge systems genetics methods, species comparisons of glaucoma phenotypes, and a strong interdisciplinary team that includes investigators with extensive experience in systems genetics, glaucoma, GWAS in human and rats, and advanced computational methods. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following thress studies: 1) Identify the candidate gene on chromosome 12 that modulates ON damage; 2) Determine if modulation of IOP and/or ON damage is shared across rodent species; and 3) Identify novel spontaneous glaucoma models through a comprehensive analysis of our enlarged BXD GRP of 100 or more BXD strains. The outcomes of these studies will define novel genes and molecular networks that underlie glaucoma-associated phenotypes and also provide unique glaucoma models for future analysis. These results are expected to fundamentally advance the field of glaucoma disease mechanisms and enable targeted therapeutic development.

"The Neurotransmitter:  Sodium Symporter Permeation Pathway    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biogenic amine transporters play important roles in the action and recycling of their specific neuretransmitter substrates. They have been well established as the targets for many pharmacological agents that affect brain function. For examples, the rewarding properties of cocaine are due mainly to its inhibition of dopamine transporter (DAT); the antidepressant effect of imipramine is exerted on serotonin transporter (SERT). These transporters belong to the NeurotransmitterSodium Symporter (NSS) family, which has a large number of prokaryotic homologs, including a tryptophan transporter (TnaT), a tyrosine transporter (Tyt1), and a leucine transporter (LeuT). Recently, a LeuT structure has been solved in high resolution, with the substrate Leu bound in an enclosed cavity. However, the determinants of substrate specificity, an understanding of which is important for rational drug design, may lie not only within the binding site crevice revealed by the LeuT structure, but also along the permeation pathway. The long term goal of the present proposal is to elucidate dynamic structural changes of the permeation pathway of NSS family proteins during the translocation cycle and to evaluate competing transport models, e. g., the alternating-access scheme and the substrate hopping model. Specifically, using prokaryotic NSS-proteins, TnaT, Tyt1, and LeuT as model systems, this will be achieved by an integrated, comparative process of iteration between molecular modeling simulations and experimental investigations/validations. With this multidisciplinary protocol we will explore the conserved residue positions and potential auxiliary cavities that line the permeation pathway and reorganize dynamically in different conformational states. The common, and the different features of the permeation pathways, including the roles of sodium ions, will be compared among TnaT/Tyt1/LeuT, and with other prokaryotic and eukaryotic NSS-proteins.

"Families of cohort survivors over 90 - Study Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to recruit families of the long term survivors in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) for the Multicenter Study on Exceptional Survival in Families (ESF). The CHS cohort (n=5888) was originally recruited from a random sample of Medicare enrollees in 4 US communities in 1989-90. They have been extremely well characterized regarding health and function, providing an opportunity to examine many specific as well as composite phenotypes over time. All have stored DNA or cryopreserved white blood cells. We have determined that about 400 individuals aged 90 and over will be available in CHS, with about 200 remaining free of disability and 100 with fairly large families (average 12) including sibs and their children. We would propose to characterize these family members at several levels of detail, to include the minimal data set suggested by the working group on exceptional survival. Since the disability measures proposed for the minimal data set may well not yet be expressed in the children, we also propose measures that would be   informative across a spectrum of age as markers of aging and subclinical disease processes. We have a long history of productive collaboration on large multicenter studies and can contribute to the design of common protocols and analytic approaches. Our goal is to contribute as a study center in the design and implementation of this study. We will recruit and examine older adults who have reached age 90, their siblings and the children of the index generation (index cases and siblings). We will determine the extent of clustering of several potential important exceptional survival phenotype. We can contribute data on environmental and behavioral determinants and intermediate phenotypes that can be assessed in younger old adults and will measure core phenotypic characteristics and important environmental exposures in these families.

"Families of cohort survivors over 90 - Study Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to recruit families of the long term survivors in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) for the Multicenter Study on Exceptional Survival in Families (ESF). The CHS cohort (n=5888) was originally recruited from a random sample of Medicare enrollees in 4 US communities in 1989-90. They have been extremely well characterized regarding health and function, providing an opportunity to examine many specific as well as composite phenotypes over time. All have stored DNA or cryopreserved white blood cells. We have determined that about 400 individuals aged 90 and over will be available in CHS, with about 200 remaining free of disability and 100 with fairly large families (average 12) including sibs and their children. We would propose to characterize these family members at several levels of detail, to include the minimal data set suggested by the working group on exceptional survival. Since the disability measures proposed for the minimal data set may well not yet be expressed in the children, we also propose measures that would be   informative across a spectrum of age as markers of aging and subclinical disease processes. We have a long history of productive collaboration on large multicenter studies and can contribute to the design of common protocols and analytic approaches.

To accomplish this objective, the center and the three accompanying proposals, an ""Expert System for inferring patient illness and treatment models"", ""Self-regulation and self-management in older asthmatics,"" and ""Disease models, psychosocial factors and end-of-life planning"", have the following specific aims: 1. To deepen our understanding of cognitive and affective processes underlying older individuals' understanding and emotional reactions to their experiences with chronic illness, and the effects of their experience on function, treatment decisions, self care, social relationships and end of life decisions. The commonsense model of self regulation (CS/SR) will be used as the framework for integrating the individual, social, institutional and cultural level processes that reflect the inter-disciplinary make up of the center faculty. 2. To translate the findings of research based on cognitive/affective science into the clinical context by developing interventions that consider all participants in the management of chronic illness: practitioners, patients, and family members. We view this as a bidirectional process, the concepts for understanding cognitive-affective processes affecting practice, and practice raising questions and suggesting concepts for inclusion in the models of patient behavior. 3. Develop, test and disseminate theory based interventions to increase the overlap of common-sense models of illness and treatments (CS/SR) held by patients and family members with each other's representations and with valid biopsychosocial models of illness and treatment. A variety of methodologies are used by each study to achieve these aims including detailed observation of provider practices, cohort designs predicting patient behaviors and health outcomes, qualitative methods, and randomized trials assessing mediating processes and testing the efficacy of specific intervention strategies.

Predicting the molecular function of novel proteins is ah urgent task for the post-genomics era. Especially, recent assessment of structural genomic efforts revealed a gap between experimental protein structure determination and the use ofthe structural knowledge for gaining understanding of biological function of the proteins at the molecular level. We will employ recent developments in discriminative machine learning approaches for constructing a residue-level classification system for function prediction from structure. Existing systems for functional prediction from structure either use global structural and sequence similarities over entire protein chain or use localized similarities such as putative functional sites. Our system will leverage the information from both global and local similarities, and identifies important residues and clusters of residues that are distinctive among different functional families. Our approach is based on and extend over an efficient optimization framework that we developed for protein superfamily classification. We expect that these methodological developments will not only improve the performance of state-of-the-art function prediction, but also help illuminating our understanding ofthe interplay of sequence and structure on defining functional variations among protein families.

"Algorithms for protein superfamily classification and function prediction The goal of this project is to develop new algorithms for protein function prediction. Recent rapid advancements in various technological developments produce biological data of unprecedented amount and complexity. Computational methods are becoming essential components in modern biomedical research. One of greatest challenges facing bioinformatician is the discovery of connections among different data sets and generating novel biological knowledge or hypotheses. Predicting the molecular function of novel proteins is ah urgent task for the post-genomics era. Especially, recent assessment of structural genomic efforts revealed a gap between experimental protein structure determination and the use ofthe structural knowledge for gaining understanding of biological function of the proteins at the molecular level. We will employ recent developments in discriminative machine learning approaches for constructing a residue-level classification system for function prediction from structure. Existing systems for functional prediction from structure either use global structural and sequence similarities over entire protein chain or use localized similarities such as putative functional sites. Our system will leverage the information from both global and local similarities, and identifies important residues and clusters of residues that are distinctive among different functional families. Our approach is based on and extend over an efficient optimization framework that we developed for protein superfamily classification.

"Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions: Computational Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cocaine inhibition of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters is responsible for the addictive properties of this potent illicit compound. A molecular model of the cocaine neurotransmitter transporter complex would promote understanding of the addictive nature of cocaine and accelerate development of therapeutics for psychiatric treatment of cocaine addiction. Recent developments in the neurotransmitter transporter field present a unique opportunity to develop an accurate model of cocaine interactions with neurotransmitter transporters. The recent report of a high-resolution crystal structure of a leucine transporter, the first member in the neurotransmitter sodium symporter (NSS) family of proteins, enables reliable structural interpretation of functional data for human dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters. This structure, combined with the currently available sequences for the NSS family and the datasets for cocaine-derived inhibitors of serotonin and dopamine transporters, give the means to create an accurate model for cocaine neurotransmitter transporter interactions. This project takes a two-pronged approach to modeling the cocaine neurotransmitter complexes. First, evolutionary conserved structural and functional constraints evolutionary will be extracted using ""evolutionary trace"" and ""statistical coupling analysis"" methods on available neurotransmitter transporter sequences. This will identify networks of residues responsible for the diverse functionalities observed in neurotransmitter transporters. Second, protein computational modeling techniques will be used to build comparative models off the leucine transporter structure, and then to predict modes of interaction for cocaine and cocaine analogs. The models can then be filtered and refined based on available biological data. Out of this project, the resulting atomic resolution models of cocaine and its analogs bound to dopamine and serotonin transporter will explain and predict the efficacy of new therapeutics for treatment of cocaine addiction. In short, the molecular models of cocaine bound to serotonin or dopamine transporter would provide a critical advancement for investigating and understanding cocaine and its neuro-chemical effects.            n/a",Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions: Computational Studies,7658677,F31DA024528,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Chemicals', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Dopamine', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Leucine', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sodium', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substance of Abuse', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analog', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'design', 'dopamine transporter', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'member', 'molecular modeling', 'mutant', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'serotonin transporter', 'small molecule', 'symporter', 'therapeutic development', 'tool']",NIDA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,28202,0.06266351073828057

"Family Immigration Status and Latino Youth Substance Use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parent unauthorized immigration status (PUIS), which refers to a foreign-born non-citizen person's lack of legal authorization to reside in the US has been neglected in studies of substance use among Latino youth, despite the fact that about a quarter of Latino youth live with an unauthorized immigrant parent. Emerging evidence suggests that the parent unauthorized immigration status (PUIS) places formidable hardships on families and leads to adverse developmental outcomes in children [22-24]. However, the effects of PUIS on family and parenting processes and their implications for substance use by Latino youth have been neglected. For instance, a search of the literature yields no published studies examining the relationship between immigration status (i.e., authorized or unauthorized) and adolescent substance use. The overall goal of this dissertation project is to understand the effects of PUIS on adolescent risk for substance use. Unauthorized immigration status refers to a foreign-born non-citizen person's lack of legal authorization to reside in the US [25]. Adolescent risk for substance use refers to pro-drug norms, self-efficacy to refuse drug offers, and intentions to use drugs. The drugs or substances of interest in this project are alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana. The goal of this project will be accomplished by a mixed-method design including qualitative and quantitative components. The project aims to 1) Identify discrete stressors confronted by families where a parent has unauthorized immigration status, the meaning families ascribe to those stressors and the strategies families use to cope with the stressors. 2) Delineate variations in exposure to immigrant stressors, family coping, parent and youth distress, and parenting practices by parent immigration status (i.e., unauthorized versus authorized). 3) Delineate the prevalence of risk for substance use in adolescents according to parent immigration status (i.e. authorized versus unauthorized), and exploring if stressor exposure and family coping are associated with differences in adolescents risk for substance use. Study aims will be accomplished using a sequential mixed-methods design. In the qualitative phase, 20 parents who are unauthorized immigrants from Mexico or the spouses/partners of unauthorized immigrants from Mexico will be interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. In the quantitative phase, 200 adolescents enrolled in 7th and 8th grade and one of their parents will complete questionnaires. Adolescents will be asked about stressors (i.e., PUIS related stressors, and general immigrant stressors) their stress response (i.e., distress), strategies their families use to cope with PUIS stressors, parenting practices, their drug refusal confidence, pro-drug norms, and intentions to use drugs (i.e., alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana). Parents will be asked about stressors (i.e., PUIS related stressors, and general immigrant stressors), stress response (i.e., distress), and strategies their families use to cope with the stressors.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rising substance use among a rapidly growing population of children of Latino immigrants will increase the burden on the nation's social systems and institutions in the decades ahead. It is imperative to determine the ecological conditions that place Latino children at risk for substance use. Due to the significant number of children of unauthorized immigrant parents, the study of the effects of parent unauthorized immigration status on family processes and youth development will inform prevention efforts, clinical practice, and policies affecting immigrant families.             ",Family Immigration Status and Latino Youth Substance Use,8702754,R36DA035976,"['Acculturation', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Authorization documentation', 'Birth Rate', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Crack Cocaine', 'Criminal Justice', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family Process', 'Fathers', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Immigrant', 'Immigration', 'Inhalant dose form', 'Institution', 'Insurance', 'Interview', 'Latino', 'Legal', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Marijuana', 'Methamphetamine', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Parenting behavior', 'Parents', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prodrugs', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self Efficacy', 'Services', 'Social Security', 'Spouses', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'clinical practice', 'coping', 'design', 'eighth grade', 'family influence', 'grandchild', 'grandparent', 'health disparity', 'intention to use drugs', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neglect', 'offspring', 'parental role', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'social', 'stressor', 'text searching']",NIDA,OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY STILLWATER,R36,2014,54000,0.07884403710261016
"Automatic Acquisition of Knowledge for Senior Care Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dramatic growth of the senior population in the U.S. is widely expected to challenge the capacity of this segment of the U.S. health system. Alternative strategies to support seniors living independently will be critical in meeting the short fall. My Health Care Manager (MHCM) has developed the Senior Care Navigation System (SCANSTM) to provide decision support to Geriatric Care Managers (GCMs), registered nurses and social workers, in the construction of consumer-side care plans for seniors and their caregivers. SCANSTM provides interventions and practical, real-world tools to extend the healthy and active years of life and assist families with critical decisions. Automatic acquisition of knowledge will help to augment MHCM's research staff in order to keep the SCANSTM knowledge base up to date for providing effective and efficient senior care plans. The overall goal for this Fast-Track SBIR research will be for MHCM in collaboration with the Indiana University's School of Informatics to develop an automated knowledge acquisition system that will acquire knowledge from health literature pertinent to senior care. This knowledge in the form of ""best practices"" will be used as part of the SCANSTM decision support system. The automatic acquisition of knowledge will greatly increase the overall productivity of the SCANS Research Team. The improvements in quality, timeliness, breadth, depth, and volume of research will be a marketable feature of the SCANSTM product. During Phase I, MHCM will validate the feasibility of automatically acquiring knowledge in literature for senior care planning. MHCM will develop knowledge extraction methodologies for geriatric care in Phase I and will implement 3 of 40 MHCM defined care categories. Phase II will expand on the algorithm(s) developed during Phase I to include an additional 30-37 care categories. MCHM will also develop geriatric care intervention discovery algorithms to be used in finding, updating, and evaluating new knowledge to be included in the SCANSTM knowledgebase. MHCM will verify and validate the feasibility of the knowledge acquisition methods by comparing the current manual research process with an automated acquisition process using literature. MHCM will then augment the knowledge discovered through text mining with an existing Bayesian Reasoning Network model to make the SCANS TM an efficient decision support system for geriatric care. With the completion of Phases I and II, commercialization of the knowledge acquisition system for SCANSTM can then proceed in Phase III of the project.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this Fast-Track research application is to improve the quality, depth and breadth of research reference material held in the Senior Care Navigation System, SCANS, knowledgebase used by our Geriatric Care Managers.

Optical scanning or on-line data capture will be used for data entry. In 2003 and 2005 clinical assessments or clinical file review will provide EEG, ECG, blood parameters, bone densitometry and autonomic nervous system data. A video protocol developed in 2001 to record functional ability will be extended to include gross motor and oral motor function, hand apraxia, gait assessment and language function. Serial videos collected in 2003 and again in 2005 will enable us to monitor changes over time and the effect of therapy or surgery. Yearly telephone interviews to families will record anthropometric data, current medication usage and update previously collected family tree data. Every two years a validated questionnaire to identify epilepsy type will be included. Resource data to determine the direct, indirect and opportunity costs associated with Rett syndrome will be compared with a normal and Down syndrome comparison group. Data analysis will use multiple regression models to examine effects of different variables on child and family level outcomes and discriminant analysis, recursive partitioning and machine learning to identify genotype/phenotype associations at the individual child level.

"LINKAGE ANALYSIS METHODS IN SCHIZOPHRENIA The long-term goal is to provide new and improved analytical methods that will enable researchers to find gene markers genetically linked with the putative gene(s) for schizophrenia.

"Strengthening Families Program Online Web Version for Teens ABSTRACT  This SBIR Phase I project uses formative evaluation strategies to develop, test, refine, and evaluate an alpha prototype of the 10-session, evidence-based Strengthening Families Program 7-17 and SFP Home-Use DVD as a web-assisted platform. The Specific Aim of the new “SFP Online!” program is to increase family accessibility and engagement by transitioning from costly group-based, facilitator-led, parenting and family skills training to low cost web-delivery. SFP draws heavily on theories that integrate family dynamics (monitoring, bonding, and communication), parenting skills, youth drug etiology (risk and protective factors), and social learning. Substantial empirical evidence from 14 RCTs with diverse families and locations shows that SFP works with large program effect sizes to reduce behavioral health risks and substance abuse. Phase I will determine whether the adapted online version can reproduce outcomes of the facilitator-led family group version with minimal loss of fidelity, efficacy, and vitality. Five integrated formative evaluation strategies involving 380 participants including ten focus groups with potential end users (100 parents and 100 youth) from SFP providers nationwide will explore adaptations, usability, feasibility and barriers to use. Consumer preference surveys tapping both recent SFP DVD users and agency service providers will explore factors that may mitigate or enhance delivery of SFP Online. This approach based on input from both parents and youth and providers will ensure that SFP Online is culturally and developmentally appropriate. We will also rely on key informant interviews with 50 family service providers and community stakeholders to address barriers to implementation and the eventual integration of SFP Online into existing prevention and treatment strategies. We will include interviews with prevention scientists and e-learning experts to review the architectural plan and ensure fidelity to current prevention and technology initiatives. These consumer surveys will inform a product specification plan supporting a “wireframe technology” to make SFP Online a viable web-assisted program. To create the alpha prototype in Phase I SFP LLC will collaborate with 3C Institute, a leading software development company with extensive expertise building interactive multimedia technology for behavioral health interventions. 3C Institute will employ its proprietary Dynamic e-Learning Platform (DeLP), a customizable technology that integrates the latest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. LARS Research Institute, a leading behavioral technology transfer company will assist in the evaluation of the program’s adherence to the standards of evidence. We will also draw on extensive community support based on 30 years of administering SFP products to family service agencies nationwide and other CBOs that emphasize parent training, and drug and child maltreatment prevention. The proposed formative evaluation strategies and collaboration with ten national prevention and e-learning experts should ensure timely and successful completion of the Phase I research activities and produce an effortless transition to the Phase II build-and-test stage. Project Narrative – SFP Online! This Phase I SBIR study seeks to adapt the Strengthening Families Program, an evidence-based facilitator-led family skills training and youth drug prevention program with family classes and entertaining video clips, to a web-based platform. Providing parenting training and drug prevention via the web offers tremendous cost savings and provides an efficient conduit for mass dissemination. The proposal utilizes five formative evaluation strategies to examine the steps required for technological adaptation and which will retain program and implementation fidelity.",Strengthening Families Program Online Web Version for Teens,9557402,R43DA046238,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Consumer Preferences', 'Cost Savings', 'Cultural Sensitivity', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Prevention Program', 'E-learning', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Evidence based program', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Family Relationship', 'Family dynamics', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Location', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Program Evaluation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Sexuality', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Problems', 'Speed', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vehicle crash', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral health intervention', 'child protection', 'child protective service', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'court', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'formative assessment', 'foster care', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'informant', 'innovation', 'interactive multimedia', 'mindfulness', 'preference', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'rehearsal', 'satisfaction', 'scaffold', 'service providers', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social learning', 'social media', 'social skills', 'software development', 'theories', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'usability', 'virtual']",NIDA,"STRENGTHENING FAMILIES PROGRAM, LLC",R43,2018,150054,0.14846258406665638
"Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track  ABSTRACT The population of the United States, as in most developed nations, is aging and is doing so at an increasing rate. This change in demographics is having a dramatic affect on the nation's healthcare delivery system and the related public costs. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the cost of long-term care for the elderly will reach $207 billion in 2020 and $346 billion in 2040. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will amount to almost 60% of the federal budget. The strong predilection of most of the elderly, and their families, is to prefer long-term care delivery in the home rather than in the institutionalized setting. This has resulted in a massive shift of elderly care costs to unpaid family caregivers, and this cost is not reflected in the budget numbers provided above. However, the continuation of this shifting of elderly care costs to family members is not sustainable due to the decrease in birth rate and the increasing number of adults surviving to old age without living children. As a result there will be an increasingly urgent need for publicly funded support of elderly home-based care while, at the same time, an equally urgent need to control the spirally cost of this care. More efficient delivery of home-care services for the elderly can have a significant impact on controlling, or even reducing, the cost of long-term elderly care. However, in order to deliver this care cost-effectively, a technology-based infrastructure optimized for this purpose will be required. One means of achieving this goal is by developing innovative mobile technology solutions which can monitor and maintain the activity, health and safety, and thereby the independence, of the elderly within the home. Our working hypothesis in this proposal is that a properly designed, head-mounted, wearable-computing solution can bring unique and powerful capabilities to address the need for more effective and lower-cost elderly home monitoring. We propose to develop a highly compact, light-weight, innovative technology called the Head-mounted Activity Monitoring (HAM) System. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to develop an innovative, low cost, ubiquitous and easy to use hardware and software system designed to support the independent living of the elderly. This wearable computing system accomplishes this by facilitating remote activity and safety monitoring, and also supports communication and interaction between the elderly, their caregivers, friends and family members, thereby reducing social isolation.            ",Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track,8647170,R44AG046969,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Behavior', 'Birth Rate', 'Breeding', 'Budgets', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ear', 'Elderly', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eyeglasses', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Home Care Services', 'Home environment', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Housing', 'Independent Living', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Social Security', 'Social isolation', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telecommunications', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Wearable Computer', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'care delivery', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'demographics', 'design', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care delivery', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light weight', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'trend', 'usability']",NIA,"GEN-9, INC.",R44,2014,222981,0.08372431484157068

"Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The population of the United States, as in most developed nations, is aging and is doing so at an increasing rate. This change in demographics is having a dramatic effect on the nation's healthcare delivery system and the related public costs. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the cost of long-term care for the elderly will reach $207 billion in 2020 and $346 billion in 2040. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will amount to almost 60% of the federal budget. The strong predilection of most of the elderly, and their families, is to prefer long-term care delivery in the home rather than in the institutionalized setting. This has resulted in a massive shift of elderly care costs t unpaid family caregivers, and this cost is not reflected in the budget numbers provided above. However, the continuation of this shifting of elderly care costs to family members is not sustainable due to the decrease in birth rate and the increasing number of adults surviving to old age without living children. As a result there will be an increasingly urgent need for publicly funded support of elderly home-based care while, at the same time, an equally urgent need to control the spirally cost of this care. More efficient delivery of home-care services for the eldery can have a significant impact on controlling, or even reducing, the cost of long-term elderly care. However, in order to deliver this care cost-effectively, a technology-based infrastructure optimized for this purpose will be required. One means of achieving this goal is by developing innovative mobile technology solutions which can monitor and maintain the activity, health and safety, and thereby the independence, of the elderly within the home. Our working hypothesis in this proposal is that a properly designed, head-mounted, wearable-computing solution can bring unique and powerful capabilities to address the need for more effective and lower-cost elderly home monitoring. We propose to develop a highly compact, light-weight, innovative technology called the Head-mounted Activity Monitoring (HAM) System.

"TREATMENT TRIAL FOR MOTHER-ADHD ADOLESCENT CONFLICT DESCRIPTION:  (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract):  The aim of this study is to conduct a carefully controlled evaluation of the efficacy and practicality of three treatment modalities with early adolescent boys (aged 11-16) who have ADHD and who reside in single-mother households. Target families will be low SES with mothers who have a high school diploma or less and family income that ranges up to $20,000 depending on the number of people in the family.  The sample will be 60 adolescents and their mothers selected on a preexistent diagnosis of ADHD using the established assessment criteria of the Children's Hospital of Michigan ADHD Clinic. All subjects will be on a stimulantmedication that is being monitored by their physicians.  The 60 adolescents and mothers will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions.  BFST (Robin & Foster, 1989) is organized into an 8 week family therapy for resolvingfamily conflict issues.  IPCT is a widely used nondirective clinical approach which focuses on insight as a mechanism for change (Cooper & Wanerman,1977, 1989).  GPMT (Barkley, Guevremont, Anastapolous, & Fletcher, 1990) is an instructional training program for mothers which focuses on modifyingtheir children's ADHD behaviors, both at home and at school.  A multidimensional battery of measures to assess treatment efficacy will be administered at pre- treatment, post-treatment, and at a 6 month followup.

"Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): KIT Solutions, a private firm specializing in developing intelligent, Knowledge-based Information Technology (KIT) solutions for the field of health and human services will partner with the University of Pittsburgh, Office of Child Development (OCD) to develop a Web-based, interactive software application of a Family Support Management Information System (FS MIS) for nationwide dissemination. This innovation is called Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT).  Family support centers, like other human service programs and agencies across the country, are being required to implement best practices and document the impact of their services to funders, policy makers, and the community. However, most family centers do not have a state-of-the-art web-based information system available to them that integrates best practice, expert knowledge, and daily management functions. The proposed LIFT system will address these critical needs and has great potential for nationwide commercial distribution. The combination of KIT'S proven record of developing knowledge based information technology and OCD's over 20 years of research and practice in family support services will greatly enhances the chance of success for this business venture. In Phase I of the project, we will produce prototype software demonstrating the benefit, usability, and feasibility of a web-based, interactive, intelligent system for use by family support centers across the nation. The extent of which LIFT enables family center staff to build skill, capacity, access information and expert knowledge, to enhance their work will be the focus of this phase. In Phase II, we will fully develop the prototype LIFT to a commercial grade web application for nationwide dissemination and further validate the commercial potential and impact of LIFT, using a quasiexperimental design, which will involve a large number of users across multiple sites. In Phase III, we will seek private funding for marketing the system to the national market. We intend to use the Microsoft.Net Platform and follow XML web service concepts to develop the proposed innovation. Collection of a subscription fee will be used to support the maintenance and future development of the system. n/a","Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT)",6990440,R43HD049229,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'family', 'focus groups', 'human subject', 'information dissemination', 'social service']",NICHD,"KIT SOLUTIONS, INC.",R43,2005,104545,0.15516385442308966
"THE UBIQUITIN-PROTEOSOME PATHWAY AND BMP-2 EXPRESSION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pharmacologic inhibition of the proteasome causes dramatic increases in bone formation in rodent bones in vitro and in vivo (Garrett.et al., 2003). Our preliminary data suggests that this effect is mediated (at least in major part) by increased expression of the bone growth regulatory factor bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). Our recent Preliminary Data suggest that the Gli family of transcriptional regulators is responsible for the effects on BMP-2. It is the purpose of this application to (1) determine the molecular mechanisms by which inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway increases osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, (2) determine the role of increased BMP-2 expression in these effects in vivo, and (3) clarify the role of the Gli family of transcription factors in the increases in BMP-2 expression. Our most recent Preliminary Data suggest that in bone cells in vitro, Gli2 (and to a lesser extent, Gli1 and 3) stimulates BMP-2 transcription, while a truncated form of Gli3 produced in the proteasome is a powerful repressor (Gli2 is degraded completely by the proteasome, but Gli1 is not processed by the proteasome). Our hypothesis therefore is that BMP-2 transcription is normally regulated by Gli2 (which stimulates it) and truncated Gli3 (which opposes the stimulatory effects of Gli2). Proteasome inhibitors enhance accumulation of Gli2 and impair formation of truncated Gli3. These inhibitors thereby selectively stimulate BMP-2 transcription and bone formation primarily because of the effects of Gli2 on the BMP-2 promoter when unopposed by truncated Gli3. In this application, our goal is to test this hypothesis by a series of in vivo and in vitro biological experiments designed to determine the precise roles of these individual Gli family members on BMP-2 transcription and bone formation, as well as their relationship to proteasome inhibition. We also plan to characterize the role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for targeting Gli3 to the proteasome, namely (-TrCP, in bone formation by the use of transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type and dominant-negative mutants of this enzyme. These experiments should clarify our understanding of the regulatory effects of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway inhibition on bone formation, and identify important potential molecular targets for regulation of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. n/a",THE UBIQUITIN-PROTEOSOME PATHWAY AND BMP-2 EXPRESSION,7455007,R01AR050605,"['26S proteasome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'BMP2 gene', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Bone Formation Stimulation', 'Bone Growth', 'Bone Matrix', 'Bone Resorption', 'COS-7 Cell', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Chemotaxis', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'DNA Binding', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dominant-Negative Mutation', 'Dose', 'Drosophila genus', 'Enzymes', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Family', 'Family member', 'GH1 gene', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Marines', 'Mediating', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nobel Prize', 'Numbers', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteogenesis', 'Osteoporosis', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Polyubiquitination', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteasome Inhibition', 'Proteasome Inhibitor', 'Protein Overexpression', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resort', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Site', 'Skeletal system', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Ubiquitin', 'Ubiquitination', 'Velcade', 'abstracting', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bone', 'bone cell', 'bone growth factor', 'bone morphogenetic protein 2', 'bone morphogenetic protein 4', 'concept', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'epoxomicin', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'member', 'mineralization', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'mutant', 'novel', 'promoter', 'research study', 'response', 'smoothened signaling pathway', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'ubiquitin-protein ligase']",NIAMS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,251037,0.08409051935129047

"Efficient Statistical Methods for Association Studies with Dense Genotypes and Family History of Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT In many genetic studies, case-control samples (probands) are recruited and phenotypes in their relatives are collected through a family health history interview on the probands. In these designs with combined genome-wide association study (GWAS) data in probands and family history in relatives (GWAS+FH), family member’s dense genotypes are often not collected due to the high cost of in-person collection of blood sample or death of a relative. Discarding relatives’ phenotypes lead to waste of much useful information because by examining patterns of the phenotypes among relatives with combination of genetic factors, environmental conditions, and lifestyle choices, a GWAS+FH leads to improved power of identifying an individual at risk of disease than using probands data alone. Multilevel models are powerful tools to test for association between genetic markers and correlated phenotypes because of their ability to account for varying degrees of relatedness among individuals. Improved power is expected from increased sample size by including relatives, higher chance to detect genuine genetic associations, and better type I error control compared to probands only analyses. However, analysis is highly challenging due to missing genotypes in relatives and correlation among family members’ phenotypes. The use of mixed effects multilevel model tools is rare in genetic association studies until recently, mainly due to the bottleneck of sub-optimal computational tools that do not meet requirements to handle large-scale GWAS and large sample size. This proposal addresses these challenges by providing fast and comprehensive statistical tools to increase our ability to map genetic variants in the combined data of proband GWAS and family history in relatives. Through multilevel mixed effects models, we will achieve improved power of association testing while controlling for correlation and confounding by: (1) use dense genotypes in probands to estimate between-family genetic similarities and expected values of missing relative genotypes; and (2) combine with within-family relatedness represented by polygenic effects. We will apply our methods to analyze Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project, which offers golden opportunities to discover genetic variants associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease in multiple ethnicity groups (Caucasian, African American and Hispanics).

"AUTOMATED PROTEIN FOLD MODEL GENERATION  The construction of a complete searchable library of protein fold                                                                        models is one of the primary goals of this resubmitted proposal. These folds         are to be represented as Discrete State Models (DSMs). These are statistical         models representing all possible sequences of secondary structures and solvent       exposure patterns compatible with a given protein 3D fold. The proposal extends      initial work that successfully used an automated assembly of such models             directly from the 3D coordinates of a set of 58 proteins of determined               structure, with the most recent work bringing this number to 790. The entire         library can be searched with a query amino acid sequence using the Hidden            Markov Model (HMM) forward algorithm for the model having highest posterior          probability. Given the most probable model or models, the HMM forward-backward       algorithm can then be used to assign to each amino acid in any query sequence        the probabilities of its occurrence in each of the modeled structural states.                                            Given the existence of such a library of modeled folds, it is also proposed to       exploit recent work on combining functionally diagnostic sequence patterns with      their proper structural context.

"HLA and KIR Genomics in Inflammatory Bowel Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The two common inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic relapsing, remitting conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Association studies have identified a number of susceptibility genes for both diseases, implicating both adaptive and innate immunity in response to intestinal microbes and, for CD, the autophagy pathway in disease susceptibility. As with virtually all autoimmune and inflammatory disease, allelic variation at the HLA class I and class II loci has been associated with both UC and CD. Based on our previous work, the association of specific HLA haplotypes (eg. DRB1*0103-DQB1*0301) is particularly strong and, based on our recent GWAS, the strongest SNP association is with particular clinical subtypes (eg. medically refractory UC). The contribution of the natural killer cells (NK) in innate immunity to the risk of IBD has not been as well examined. NK cells are controlled by several gene families that encode cell surface receptors. The stimulatory and/or inhibitory KIR receptors use polymorphic epitopes on HLA class I as their cognate ligands. In a recent study of CD, we found inhibitory KIR heterozygotes (KIR2DL2/KIR2DL3) significantly associated with protection in the absence of their HLA ligand (CI), and predisposing in the presence of CI ligand homozygosity. We propose to expand this work by examining the role of HLA and KIR alleles, haplotypes and KIR gene-HLA ligand pairs with clinically well-defined CD and UC cohorts of Caucasian and Hispanic-Puerto Rican ancestry. We will use our newly developed Roche 454 GS FLX sequencing system for allelic HLA resolution, and will finish development and validation on our KIR (16 gene) 454 assays to sequence both gene complexes in our cohorts. Caucasian (1300 patients/550 controls and 100 family trios) and Puerto Rican (300 patients/200 controls) CD cohorts, and Caucasian (300 patients with medically refractory disease/550 controls) and Puerto Rican (200 patients/200 controls) UC cohorts will be examined.

"HLA and KIR Genomics in Inflammatory Bowel Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The two common inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic relapsing, remitting conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Association studies have identified a number of susceptibility genes for both diseases, implicating both adaptive and innate immunity in response to intestinal microbes and, for CD, the autophagy pathway in disease susceptibility. As with virtually all autoimmune and inflammatory disease, allelic variation at the HLA class I and class II loci has been associated with both UC and CD. Based on our previous work, the association of specific HLA haplotypes (eg. DRB1*0103-DQB1*0301) is particularly strong and, based on our recent GWAS, the strongest SNP association is with particular clinical subtypes (eg. medically refractory UC). The contribution of the natural killer cells (NK) in innate immunity to the risk of IBD has not been as well examined. NK cells are controlled by several gene families that encode cell surface receptors. The stimulatory and/or inhibitory KIR receptors use polymorphic epitopes on HLA class I as their cognate ligands. In a recent study of CD, we found inhibitory KIR heterozygotes (KIR2DL2/KIR2DL3) significantly associated with protection in the absence of their HLA ligand (CI), and predisposing in the presence of CI ligand homozygosity. We propose to expand this work by examining the role of HLA and KIR alleles, haplotypes and KIR gene-HLA ligand pairs with clinically well-defined CD and UC cohorts of Caucasian and Hispanic-Puerto Rican ancestry. We will use our newly developed Roche 454 GS FLX sequencing system for allelic HLA resolution, and will finish development and validation on our KIR (16 gene) 454 assays to sequence both gene complexes in our cohorts.

"Determinants of Behavior Problems after Divorce  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processes responsible for the association between divorce and adjustment in adults and their offspring are not well understood. The higher rates of behavioral and psychological problems in adults and children from divorced families were originally considered to be consequences of marital disruption, but may also reflect nonrandom selection of families into divorce. In order to disentangle these processes, the proposed research will utilize data from a longitudinal study of Australian adult twins and their offspring. First, analyses of monozygotic and dizygotic adult twins discordant for divorce will examine how genetic and environmental processes account for the increased problems among divorced individuals. Second, the children of twins design will investigate the causal and selection factors responsible for the relation between marital dissolution and functioning in young-adult offspring. Third, the proposed analyses will assess how family and individual characteristics mediate the environmental and genetic influences associated with offspring's adjustment to their parents' divorce. Finally, training opportunities will provide the opportunity to explore whether the family environment controls genetic expression of offspring behavior problems, use longitudinal data to study developmental changes in children's response to family conflict, and employ decision tree analyses to study how multiple risk and protective factors interact to influence child development. The proposed research seeks to move beyond simple associations between familial characteristics and outcomes and elucidate causal mechanisms by utilizing genetically informative designs, longitudinal data, and advanced quantitative methods.   n/a",Determinants of Behavior Problems after Divorce,6656262,F31MH067300,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' behavioral genetics', ' clinical research', ' conflict', ' developmental psychology', ' divorce /separation', ' family structure /dynamics', ' functional ability', ' gene environment interaction', ' human data', ' longitudinal human study', ' parent offspring interaction', ' personality', ' predoctoral investigator', ' psychological adaptation', ' psychological stressor', ' social behavior', ' socioenvironment', ' twin /multiplet']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,F31,2003,25481,0.046798749974475945

"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionar data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, individual transport systems and constituent proteins.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to expand, update, automate and interlink TCDB. In particular, we will collaborate to integrate and unify the classification systems used by TCDB and Pfam with the formation of a TC ontological system. We will generate new data concerning transport proteins, and expand procedures for making functional predictions. This last effort will derive reliable new biological knowledge from a variety of sources, including phylogeny, motif, domain, operon and regulon analyses. Our Specific Aims are as follows: 1. To compare and evaluate methods of homology establishment, e.g., our and Pfam's statistical approaches, as well as introduce a system of protein repeat unit and domain identification. We will confirm and extend homology results based on structural superimpositions and profile: profile comparisons. We will develop and implement pipelines for the exchange of information between Pfam and TCDB and standardize both classification systems. 2. To incorporate our family descriptions into Wikipedia, to facilitate community annotation and interaction. Thus, we will add to Wikipedia, and integrate with Pfam to create a common platform for community annotation. 3. To create a substrate ontological framework for TCDB, using ChEBI and GO. 4. To use and automate multiple approaches, including phylogeny and synteny, to derive reliable functional predictions and provide guides for other researchers to do the same. 5. To utilize our TCDB advisory board for continued knowledgebase modernization and sustainability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: TCDB is a database providing the worldwide scientific community with systematized information about proteins that catalyze transmembrane transport. It is the only IUBMB-approved system for classifying transport proteins. Funding of this proposal will allow the introduction of ontological systems, maintenance and further development of TCDB, integration with Pfam, incorporation of TC descriptions into Wikipedia and introduction of novel approaches for predicting the functions of uncharacterized proteins.",The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB),9452067,R01GM077402,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Cistrons', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Data Base Management', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Ecosystem', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'International', 'Internet', 'Island', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Biology', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Ontology', 'Operon', 'Organelles', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Phylogeny', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Regulon', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Synteny', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Transmembrane Transport', 'Update', 'base', 'computer science', 'design', 'genome annotation', 'hydrophilicity', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'knowledge integration', 'markov model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'protein transport', 'public health relevance', 'text searching', 'transcriptome', 'transmission process', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,302250,0.030797779730313717

"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionar data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, individual transport systems and constituent proteins.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to expand, update, automate and interlink TCDB. In particular, we will collaborate to integrate and unify the classification systems used by TCDB and Pfam with the formation of a TC ontological system. We will generate new data concerning transport proteins, and expand procedures for making functional predictions. This last effort will derive reliable new biological knowledge from a variety of sources, including phylogeny, motif, domain, operon and regulon analyses. Our Specific Aims are as follows: 1. To compare and evaluate methods of homology establishment, e.g., our and Pfam's statistical approaches, as well as introduce a system of protein repeat unit and domain identification. We will confirm and extend homology results based on structural superimpositions and profile: profile comparisons. We will develop and implement pipelines for the exchange of information between Pfam and TCDB and standardize both classification systems. 2.

"Neurocognition as an endophenotype in bipolar disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a third submission for a Mentored Patient-oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to support the candidate's development into an independent investigator capable of integrating a solid background and training in neurocognition with the tools of molecular genetics for use in family-based studies of bipolar disorder (BPD). Persistent neurocognitive deficits in BPD during periods of euthymia have aroused interest in neurocognitive dysfunction as an intermediate phenotype, or endophenotype, for studies of its disease susceptibility loci; however, a critical gap in our knowledge exists regarding its familiality or heritability. The endophenotypic criterion of aggregation within families has not yet been convincingly demonstrated among unaffected first-degree relatives of BPD patients. The candidate proposes to first gain the knowledge and training required to collect and analyze data to provide critical validation and refinement of neurocognition as an endophenotype for BPD and to subsequently conduct preliminary research toward this goal. The development plan has three major goals: 1) To expand and refine the candidate's knowledge of the neurocognition of BPD with regard to its use in molecular genetic studies 2) To gain experience in family study methodology including a significant emphasis on understanding molecular genetic models and statistical approaches to integrate quantitative clinical data and molecular genetic data, and 3) To acquire direct research experience and preliminary data on the genetic underpinnings of neurocognitive dysfunction in BPD. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive didactic program has been prepared. In addition, the candidate will conduct a family-based study of neurocognition in patients with BPD and their unaffected siblings. The research plan proposes to collect comprehensive neurocognitive data in 100 unaffected siblings of BPD patients, 100 stable BPD patients, and 100 demographically-matched healthy volunteers. The feasibility of large-scale implementation of such a viable assay would represent a vital step toward elucidating the genetic underpinnings of BPD. The career development activities and completion of the research study described in this application are expected to provide the candidate with the knowledge and experience to develop into an independent investigator with the expertise to conduct high quality family- based studies that incorporate neurocognition into molecular genetic studies of bipolar disorder.          n/a",Neurocognition as an endophenotype in bipolar disorder,8197071,K23MH077807,"['Age', 'Attention', 'Biological Assay', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Education', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'First Degree Relative', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Nature', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pleomorphism', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Race', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Verbal Learning', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'data reduction', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'experience', 'healthy volunteer', 'interest', 'patient oriented', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'research study', 'sex', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K23,2012,162275,0.06566067926458334

"Computational Modeling of Cell Migration in 3D Matrices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to construct and test predictive computational models for how diverse intracellular signals integrate to govern cell migration responses to cues in three-dimensional environments. Our technical approach comprises several features in innovative combination: {1} 3D quantitative tracking of individual cell migration parameters within relevant biomacromolecular matrices; {2} quantitative biochemical measurements of key intracellular signals during this 3D migration; {3} modulation of these signals by genetic manipulation of receptor properties and by pharmacological inhibition of key molecular switches; {4} computational modeling of the quantitative relationship of these signals to the consequent migration response; and {5} experimental test of non-intuitive model predictions. We focus on signals and responses induced by the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) cues. Signals generated downstream of ErbB family receptor ligand binding strongly influence migration response behavior of many cell types, including carcinoma cells during tumor progression to invasion and metastasis. This paradigmatic ""cue-signal- response"" system is important physiologically during organogenesis and tissue regeneration, and when aberrant enables the pathology of tumor invasion and dissemination. Thus, understanding how the signaling control is exerted quantitatively should have broadly relevant and useful implications for both basic science and therapeutic applications. Although a multitude of individual components in the ErbB signaling network have been identified, quantitative models integratively relating these divergent signaling pathways to migration response behavior are only now emerging. Very little fundamental work on signaling governing migration has been performed in 3D environments that truly represent the barriers to tumor invasion and dissemination. Our work intimately integrates computational modeling with dedicated quantitative experimental measurement of ErbB family-induced cell migration and signaling network activity within 3D matrices. Our modeling approach will focus not on the more commonly-pursued ""cue-signal"" facet (that of signal generation from ligand/receptor cues, but instead the sorely under-addressed ""signal-response"" facet. Although it is clear that multiple signaling pathways downstream of ErbB receptors can play significant roles in regulating migration, what is not understood is how multi-pathway networks quantitatively integrate to yield the observed phenotypic behavior. This question will be addressed using the statistical modeling framework known as Decision Tree analysis, which defines a control hierarchy relating logical combinations of signals to the migration behavioral response across all cue conditions. Our goal for the proposed grant is to apply decision tree modeling to prediction of effects of ErbB receptor signaling on epithelial and carcinoma cell migration through three-dimensional matrices.

"Mechanisms of Protein Structure Evolution    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The traditional view of protein evolution has been that all protein domains are descendents of distinct evolutionary lines, that there are a relatively small number of such lines (about 1000), and that these lines are all of relatively ancient origin. Two new bodies of evidence make that view untenable. First, analysis of sets of fully sequenced genomes shows that most protein families appear to be small, and narrowly distributed in phylogenetic space, apparently implying recent emergence. Second, analysis of the relationship between known protein structures shows that there are many more than a 1000 distinct folds, appearing to imply many more evolutionary lines. The large discrepancy between theory and fact has been clear for some time and a number of explanations have been put forward. But so far there has been no definitive study of alternatives. In this project we will systematically and quantitatively investigate four separate hypotheses, each of which may account for some share of the large number of protein folds and apparently young proteins: that these (1) are the result of generation of new open reading frames or frame shifted older ones; (2) are the outcome of extensive recombination of portions of older proteins; (3) are laterally transferred from unexplored parts of phylogenetic space; (4) are part of larger older families where there has been rapid sequence change, such that not all relatives are found. To investigate these hypotheses we will develop and extend a set of computational methods. These include methods of building protein families; reliably estimating the age of protein families, detecting lateral gene transfer effects; determining to what extent members of families are likely to have been detected with sequence methods; more quantitatively determining whether protein structures are evolutionarily related; searching for remote structure and sequence relationships; and analyzing a range of protein properties as a function of family age.

"TAILORED COMPUTER EDUCATION TO INCREASE LIVING DONATION IN AFRICAN-AMERICANS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kidney transplantation offers patients in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 3 to 17 additional years of life and improved quality-of-life compared to remaining on dialysis. Because of the deceased donor organ shortage, more kidney patients are choosing to receive kidneys from family and friends, a process called living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). Although African-Americans are 3.7 times more likely to develop ESRD, they are less likely to receive LDKTs. Therefore, this project will assess whether racial disparities in transplant knowledge, readiness to pursue LDKT, completion of transplant medical evaluation, and receipt of LDKTs can be reduced when ESRD patients receive access to personalized coaching and individually-tailored feedback using an Explore Transplant computerized Expert System. This multilevel study will also examine how other known patient, family, and healthcare system barriers to LDKT impact the Expert System's effectiveness. ESRD patients presenting for transplant medical evaluation at Barnes-Jewish Transplant Center in St. Louis, Missouri (465 African-Americans, 465 Whites) will be stratified by race and randomized to one of two education conditions (Explore Transplant Expert System vs. Standard Education Control). As they complete transplant medical evaluation, patients in the Expert System condition will receive individually tailored feedback reports and personalized coaching addressing variables important to behavior change and associated with LDKT health disparities. Control patients will only receive standard-of-care education provided by the transplant center. Changes in key outcomes will be assessed at four time points (2-months before in-hospital evaluation day (IHED) (baseline), 2- and 6-months post-IHED, and 18-months post-baseline). The grant has four aims:  Aim 1 (Primary): Compared to the Control Group, to determine whether African-American and White patients receiving the Expert System increase in their LDKT readiness and transplant knowledge 6-months post-IHED.  Aim 2: Compared to the Control group, to determine whether African-American and White patients receiving the Expert System are more likely to complete transplant medical evaluation and pursue LDKT 18- months post-baseline.  Aim 3: To examine whether the Expert System's effectiveness in changing LDKT decision-making and behavior is equivalent between African-Americans and Whites.  Aim 4: To examine how known patient, family, and healthcare system barriers to LDKT act alone and in combination with the Expert System to affect African-Americans' decision-making and behavior.  At the conclusion of the study, we will have developed an innovative and cost-effective Explore Transplant Expert System that could be utilized by providers in 5,000 dialysis and 250 transplant centers to tailor LDKT discussion and education based on the needs of individual patients of different races. Patients with kidney failure have better health and quality-of-life when they receive a transplant, especially a transplant from a living donor (LDKT). Although kidney failure disproportionately affects African-Americans, Whites are more likely to receive LDKTs.

Because of the deceased donor organ shortage, more kidney patients are choosing to receive kidneys from family and friends, a process called living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). Although African-Americans are 3.7 times more likely to develop ESRD, they are less likely to receive LDKTs. Therefore, this project will assess whether racial disparities in transplant knowledge, readiness to pursue LDKT, completion of transplant medical evaluation, and receipt of LDKTs can be reduced when ESRD patients receive access to personalized coaching and individually-tailored feedback using an Explore Transplant computerized Expert System. This multilevel study will also examine how other known patient, family, and healthcare system barriers to LDKT impact the Expert System's effectiveness. ESRD patients presenting for transplant medical evaluation at Barnes-Jewish Transplant Center in St. Louis, Missouri (465 African-Americans, 465 Whites) will be stratified by race and randomized to one of two education conditions (Explore Transplant Expert System vs. Standard Education Control). As they complete transplant medical evaluation, patients in the Expert System condition will receive individually tailored feedback reports and personalized coaching addressing variables important to behavior change and associated with LDKT health disparities. Control patients will only receive standard-of-care education provided by the transplant center. Changes in key outcomes will be assessed at four time points (2-months before in-hospital evaluation day (IHED) (baseline), 2- and 6-months post-IHED, and 18-months post-baseline). The grant has four aims:  Aim 1 (Primary): Compared to the Control Group, to determine whether African-American and White patients receiving the Expert System increase in their LDKT readiness and transplant knowledge 6-months post-IHED.  Aim 2: Compared to the Control group, to determine whether African-American and White patients receiving the Expert System are more likely to complete transplant medical evaluation and pursue LDKT 18- months post-baseline.  Aim 3: To examine whether the Expert System's effectiveness in changing LDKT decision-making and behavior is equivalent between African-Americans and Whites.  Aim 4: To examine how known patient, family, and healthcare system barriers to LDKT act alone and in combination with the Expert System to affect African-Americans' decision-making and behavior.  At the conclusion of the study, we will have developed an innovative and cost-effective Explore Transplant Expert System that could be utilized by providers in 5,000 dialysis and 250 transplant centers to tailor LDKT discussion and education based on the needs of individual patients of different races.        Patients with kidney failure have better health and quality-of-life when they receive a transplant, especially a transplant from a living donor (LDKT). Although kidney failure disproportionately affects African-Americans, Whites are more likely to receive LDKTs. This randomized controlled trial of 930 African-American and White patients will develop and assess the effectiveness of individually tailored, computer-generated education using an Expert System for overcoming specific barriers affecting African-Americans' pursuit of LDKT.

"Health, Neighborhood Context, and Mobility Neighborhood context may be an upstream cause of economic mobility, yet few neighborhood studies are experimental, weakening causal inference and limiting policy translation. Our study proposes to analyze newly- available data from a large, federal government initiated social experiment of voluntary neighborhood relocation using housing vouchers in 5 US cities (the Moving to Opportunity, MTO, Study). Our project will test whether, how, and among whom random assignment of an offer to move to a lower-poverty neighborhood influenced the economic mobility of 4600 low-income families over a 15 year period. The goal of MTO was to interrupt the cascading effects of neighborhood poverty for minority low-income families, by increasing area- based access to opportunities, and thereby promote economic mobility. Although the MTO voucher intervention did not consistently affect economic outcomes, it did profoundly affect health. Unfortunately, health researchers have had limited access to MTO data, compromising the scientific payoff of the $70+ million investment. So as of yet, we have no clear understanding of why results might differ across outcomes, groups, or what mechanisms are at play, since few studies have tested mediation or moderation. Since health is one of the most important barriers to economic self-sufficiency among low-income parents, it is conceivable that economic and employment gains were concentrated among families who first experienced health improvements. However testing whether factors that occurred after random assignment are precursors for other outcomes is methodologically challenging. Fortunately, recent methodological developments in the epidemiology discipline offer cogent solutions to model this complexity and bound any bias. We propose secondary data analyses with newly available 15 year follow-up data from this experiment, to test whether health influenced the economic effects of the randomized MTO housing voucher treatment. Paired with this experimental design, we propose to apply innovative causal methods and machine learning techniques for assessing mediation and effect modification, to overcome limitations and potential bias of traditional approaches, and strengthen causal inference. Our R01 project builds on a productive, interdisciplinary team, experienced with the MTO data, and draws on a barriers-to-employment framework. We propose 4 aims to determine: whether the effect of MTO on economic outcomes was modified by baseline health vulnerability; whether MTO improved parental economic outcomes, if they or their children experienced health gains; whether MTO improved children’s employment and education, if they experienced health gains; whether MTO improved economic outcomes, if families moved to neighborhoods with fewer spatial barriers to employment. Our findings have direct policy relevance since they address a key policy question in housing voucher implementation: incorporating elements from non-housing sectors (e.g., health, employment, education) to promote moves to higher opportunity neighborhoods, to ultimately improve outcomes for low income families. This project will test whether health-related barriers to employment mediate and moderate the effects of a social experiment of housing and neighborhood relocation on economic mobility, among adolescents, young adults, and their mothers. This knowledge will inform the next generation of social policy, e.g., to provide guidance on augmenting housing counseling assistance services to include health-related additional program supports and cross-sectoral services (e.g. health management or substance use treatment services) for vulnerable families.","Health, Neighborhood Context, and Mobility",9712679,R01HD090014,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Budgets', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Cities', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Compromising', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Elements', 'Employment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Federal Government', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Income', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Poverty', 'Privatization', 'Public Housing', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Services', 'Social Policies', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wages', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'economic outcome', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'health management', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'lower income families', 'next generation', 'physical conditioning', 'programs', 'social', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment services', 'volunteer', 'voucher', 'welfare', 'young adult']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,483010,0.10390515243326776

"Understanding the impact of bullying news coverage on youth and families: Implications for future interventions ABSTRACT Bullying is a preventable public health problem that can have long-lasting health, academic and social consequences. Bullying affects between 18% and 31% of adolescents and has been associated with serious negative consequences including depression, substance use, and academic failure for both the perpetrator and target. Over the past decade, bullying behavior has expanded into the digital realm and is known as cyberbullying. Cyberbullying stories have had frequent coverage by news organizations, including coverage of teens whose death from suicide was attributed to cyberbullying. Previous work illustrates the influence of news stories on individual’s attitudes and experiences. News organization coverage has been influential to readers in areas such as suicide, infectious disease outbreaks such as H1N1 flu, and tobacco use. Little is known whether and how adolescents and their families perceive or utilize news coverage of bullying or cyberbullying. News media may be an untapped resource to promote bullying prevention messages and strategies. Our long- term goal is to develop and test interventions to improve bullying prevention and intervention efforts working with media. Towards that goal, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of news organization coverage of bullying and cyberbullying and its impact on youth and families. First, we will evaluate youth and parent perspectives on lay media coverage of bullying using qualitative interviews with 50 participants: 25 diverse adolescents age 15-18 years and 25 parent/guardians of these adolescents. Second, we will assess the current state of the narrative in news media coverage of bullying. We will identify a sample of 500 news articles from print/online media that cover bullying over the past 5 years and conduct content analysis using natural language processing. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software we will evaluate the proportion of words that represent fear-based reporting such as alarmist words (e.g. epidemic, tragic), as well as words that represent public health-oriented messages such as prevention. We will also compare news coverage of bullying to cyberbullying. After analyzing data from these two aims, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 30 journalists. Our third aim is to synthesize these findings and identify strategies for future interventions that are feasible and acceptable to journalists. We will work with 3 consultants from the fields of communication and journalism to identify and engage journalists (n=30) in qualitative interviews. When these interconnected study aims are successfully completed, outcomes will include a comprehensive understanding of how adolescents and their parents understand and utilize news coverage of bullying, the current state of bullying and cyberbullying news coverage narrative, and perspectives of journalists on intervention approaches that are feasible and acceptable. We will utilize these findings towards novel intervention approaches, such as to leverage news coverage towards enhancing prevention of bullying.

"Understanding the impact of bullying news coverage on youth and families: Implications for future interventions ABSTRACT Bullying is a preventable public health problem that can have long-lasting health, academic and social consequences. Bullying affects between 18% and 31% of adolescents and has been associated with serious negative consequences including depression, substance use, and academic failure for both the perpetrator and target. Over the past decade, bullying behavior has expanded into the digital realm and is known as cyberbullying. Cyberbullying stories have had frequent coverage by news organizations, including coverage of teens whose death from suicide was attributed to cyberbullying. Previous work illustrates the influence of news stories on individual’s attitudes and experiences. News organization coverage has been influential to readers in areas such as suicide, infectious disease outbreaks such as H1N1 flu, and tobacco use. Little is known whether and how adolescents and their families perceive or utilize news coverage of bullying or cyberbullying. News media may be an untapped resource to promote bullying prevention messages and strategies. Our long- term goal is to develop and test interventions to improve bullying prevention and intervention efforts working with media. Towards that goal, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of news organization coverage of bullying and cyberbullying and its impact on youth and families. First, we will evaluate youth and parent perspectives on lay media coverage of bullying using qualitative interviews with 50 participants: 25 diverse adolescents age 15-18 years and 25 parent/guardians of these adolescents. Second, we will assess the current state of the narrative in news media coverage of bullying. We will identify a sample of 500 news articles from print/online media that cover bullying over the past 5 years and conduct content analysis using natural language processing. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software we will evaluate the proportion of words that represent fear-based reporting such as alarmist words (e.g. epidemic, tragic), as well as words that represent public health-oriented messages such as prevention. We will also compare news coverage of bullying to cyberbullying. After analyzing data from these two aims, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 30 journalists. Our third aim is to synthesize these findings and identify strategies for future interventions that are feasible and acceptable to journalists. We will work with 3 consultants from the fields of communication and journalism to identify and engage journalists (n=30) in qualitative interviews. When these interconnected study aims are successfully completed, outcomes will include a comprehensive understanding of how adolescents and their parents understand and utilize news coverage of bullying, the current state of bullying and cyberbullying news coverage narrative, and perspectives of journalists on intervention approaches that are feasible and acceptable. We will utilize these findings towards novel intervention approaches, such as to leverage news coverage towards enhancing prevention of bullying.

"Multiscale modeling of G protein-coupled receptors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family in the mammalian genome, and are critical to a number of cell signaling processes. As a result, they are of enormous biomedical importance; by some estimates, as many as 50% of new pharmaceuticals target GPCRs. Unsurprisingly, there has been a huge research investment in understanding their biophysics. However, integral membrane proteins are challenging to work with experimentally, leaving an opportunity for computational methods to make a significant contribution. We will use multiscale modeling techniques, including all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and elastic network models, to explore the behavior of several GPCRs, including rhodopsin (and its retinal-free form, opsin) and the ¿2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR). Specifically, we will investigate the role of ligand binding in modulating GPCR function, via two separate all-atom molecular dynamics calculations. Microsecond-scale simulations of opsin will, when contrasted with our previous work on rhodopsin in the dark state and during the early stages of activation, allow us to see which interactions in rhodopsin are determined by the presence of the ligand, while the planned simulations of the full activation process will give the first atomic-level view of the structural changes involved in GPCR activation; this knowledge could be critical to the design of novel inhibitors to other GPCRs. The second goal of this proposal is to clarify the role of internal waters in the activation mechanism of GPCRs; our previous simulations described significant increases in the internal hydration of rhodopsin and B2AR. Here, we propose to pursue those observations more rigorously, using automatic pattern recognition methods to correlate hydration changes with functionally interesting protein motions in simulations of rhodopsin, B2AR, and the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2). The third goal of the proposal is to develop elastic network models - a simple, computationally inexpensive approach where the protein's interactions are represented as a network of springs - in order to explore larger scale problems not readily amenable to all-atom molecular dynamics, like the modulation of protein motions by G protein binding and GPCR oligomerization. A number of possible network model implementations will be considered, and the models will be carefully validated by quantitative comparison to extensive molecular dynamics simulations, including those proposed for the first aim. The fourth and final goal of the proposal is to assess the validity of a common assumption, that rhodopsin is a good template for understanding GPCR activation in general. To test this hypothesis we will apply multiple computational methods, including long timescale molecular dynamics and elastic network models, to a series of GPCRs, including rhodopsin, opsin, B2AR, and CB2. We will quantitatively correlate the fluctuations of the different GPCRs, with the hypothesis that motions conserved across multiple GPCRs are likely to be functionally significant.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: G protein-coupled receptors are the largest family of proteins in the human genome, and are the most targeted proteins for therapeutics development.

"Genetic Predisposition To Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms/Dissections Thoracic aortic aneurysms leading to acute aortic dissections (TAAD) are a cause of premature deaths, responsible for up to 8% of sudden deaths in industrialized countries. Identifying individuals at risk for TAAD allows for medical management that prevents deaths due to dissections. We determined that up to 20% of TAAD patients without a known genetic syndrome have a family history of TAAD, which is inherited primarily in an autosomal dominant manner (termed heritable thoracic aortic disease, HTAD). We established a cohort of HTAD families (842 families with two or more members with TAAD) and used this cohort to identify novel HTAD genes. Positional cloning and candidate gene approaches by our lab and others have successfully identified 18 genes for HTAD. We hypothesize that there are multiple altered genes yet to be identified, disrupting known and novel molecular pathways responsible for thoracic aortic disease, and responsible for disease in the unsolved HTAD families. The overarching goal of the project is to identify the remaining genes for HTAD, characterize the phenotype associated with these novel genes, perform initial molecular studies linking the mutant gene to aortic disease, and rapidly translate these findings into improved clinical care and prevention of premature deaths due to aortic dissection in HTAD families. The proposed aims are: (1) Recruit and characterize additional HTAD families to be used to identify novel genes, and delineate the clinical features and mutation spectrum associated with new genes; (2) Pursue exome/genome sequencing on HTAD cases and use the genetic strategies to identify novel genes, including segregation of rare variants in affected relatives and trios (affected proband and unaffected parents) and burden analyses; (3) Pursue a machine-learning approach using exome data from HTAD families and controls to identify novel disease genes; (4) Perform initial molecular and cellular biology studies of novel HTAD genes to confirm a link between the mutant gene and thoracic aortic disease. In summary, we are uniquely poised to identify novel HTAD genes using our assembled cohort and are proposing both proven and novel strategies to identify additional HTAD genes. Uncovering HTAD genes is crucial for identifying individuals at risk for aortic dissections and initiating gene-specific clinical management to prevent premature death due to dissections.

"Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal responds to RFA-MH-17-612, “Pilot Effectiveness Trials for Treatment, Preventive and Services Interventions (R34).” We have shown in several randomized trials that family-focused therapy (FFT) for symptomatic youth at high-risk for bipolar disorder - consisting of psychoeducation and family communication and problem solving skills training - is an effective adjunct to pharmacotherapy in hastening symptomatic recovery. However, between 50%-60% of high-risk youth still have residual mood symptoms and functional impairment after 18 weeks of FFT. In our prior studies, two constructs have emerged as predictors of lack of response to treatment: mood instability in the child and expressed emotion (EE) in parents (i.e., frequent critical comments or hostility). In adolescents (ages 12-18) with a parent with bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder, we hypothesize that augmenting FFT with frequent and targeted interventions in the home setting through a Smartphone app (MyCoachConnect, or MCC) will (a) have a greater and more rapid impact than standard FFT on the targeted mechanisms of mood instability in adolescents and EE in parents, and (b) as a result, enhance symptom resolution and functioning in adolescents. To be eligible, adolescents must score high on parent-rated measures of mood instability, and have at least one parent who is high-EE by speech sample coding criteria. The MCC app will record weekly open speech samples from parents and children and daily and weekly mood ratings from adolescents. The app assessments will be fed back to the FFT clinician, who will use this information to “push” recommendations for mood regulation, communication, and problem-solving strategies (linked to the FFT modules) for parents and youth. In year 1, we will conduct an open trial (n=25) to determine (a) the feasibility and acceptability of FFT with mobile coaching (FFT-MCC), as given by clinicians in community settings, and (b) associations between online/speech feature proxies of the targets (mood instability and EE as measured weekly by MCC) and standard measures of the targets. In years 2 and 3 we will conduct a 75- case RCT in which families are assigned to FFT with MCC skills coaching, FFT with MCC assessments only, with no coaching; or FFT Only, without MCC. We hypothesize that FFT-MCC will be acceptable to parents, adolescents and clinicians, and more effective than FFT without MCC coaching or FFT-Only in engaging the targets of mood instability and EE and promoting improvements in adolescents' mood symptoms and quality of life over 27 weeks. The study will facilitate the translation of a technological augmentation to an evidence-based family intervention, with the goal of increasing treatment access among families with mood disorders. Project Narrative/Relevance We propose to enhance the scalability of family-focused therapy (FFT), a 12-session evidence- based therapy for youth at high risk for mood disorders, through augmentation with a novel mobile phone application called MyCoachConnect (MCC). In adolescents with mood instability who have a parent with bipolar or major depressive disorder, clinicians in community clinics will conduct FFT sessions (consisting of psychoeducation and family skills training) supplemented by weekly MCC “real time” assessments of moods and family relationships; based on results of these assessments and the family's progress in treatment, clinicians will then push personalized informational and coaching alerts regarding the practice of communication and problem-solving skills.

"Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use ABSTRACT: The use of prescription amphetamines for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has markedly increased in the last fifteen years, with the greatest increase in adolescents and young adults. In 2007, the FDA mandated changes to stimulant labels to warn of increases in psychosis and mania in patients without pre-existing conditions. Our multidisciplinary research team from Brigham and Women's Hospital and McLean Hospital recently published a landmark cohort study demonstrating an increased risk of psychotic episodes in new users of amphetamine compared to methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD. Alarmingly, the use of amphetamines increased four-fold over the study period (2004 – 2015). In addition, our data show that prescription amphetamine use has dramatically increased in patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder. Thus, there is an urgent need to accelerate knowledge about prescriber-level factors, patient-level factors and disease states that potentiate the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines. Large-scale studies using real-world data are the only option to study the risk of infrequent and serious adverse outcomes. In Aim 1, using incident-user cohort study designs, we will utilize data from two national administrative claims databases to identify prescriber dosing strategies that increase the risk of first-episode psychosis in ~220,000 adolescents and adults with ADHD initiating amphetamines. We hypothesize that there will be a dose-dependent increase in the risk of psychosis. The goal of Aim 2 is to identify patient subgroups at heightened risk of psychosis/mania with prescription amphetamine use. To accomplish this goal, we will perform a case control study using electronic medical records (EMR) from McLean Hospital in ~1,650 patients hospitalized for an initial episode of psychosis or mania compared to ~3,300 controls with a first psychiatric hospitalization for reasons other than psychosis or mania. We will apply natural language processing to unstructured narrative notes to capture detailed patient data not available in claims data. We hypothesize that patients with a family history of psychiatric illness will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without a family history. We also hypothesize that patients with concurrent cannabis use will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without cannabis use. Aim 3 compares the risk of treatment-emergent mania in ~52,000 new users of amphetamine versus methylphenidate in a cohort study of patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder, an urgent issue given the known risk of mania with stimulant use. Combined, these studies will provide actionable evidence to be incorporated into clinical practice guidelines with the goal of mitigating the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription stimulants. The proposed research agenda aligns with NIMH Strategic Objective 3.3 “Striving for Prevention and Cure” on testing interventions in real-world practice settings to evaluate the impact of patient- and provider-level factors on clinical outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE: In recent years, 6.1 million U.S. children and adolescents were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 16 million adults reported past-year use of prescription stimulants. The research team recently found an increased risk of psychosis in new users of prescription amphetamines compared to new users of prescription methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD, translating to potentially increased risk of psychosis for thousands of U.S. patients. Therefore, identifying patient subgroups and prescribing practices that increase the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines has enormous public health significance and will guide providers to avoid amphetamines in patients at highest risk, preventing future cases of psychosis and mania.",Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use,9939094,R01MH122427,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amphetamine Users', 'Amphetamines', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Boston', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'First Degree Relative', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immigration', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Manic', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Modification', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Hospitals', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Ritalin', 'Sampling', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'amphetamine use', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'cost effective', 'data warehouse', 'first episode psychosis', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'patient subsets', 'practice setting', 'prevent', 'stimulant use', 'treatment risk', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2020,746678,0.03043899635628674
"Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Anxiety disorders in youth are highly prevalent [1] and impairing [2-4]. Left untreated, these disorders confer substantial additional risk for the development of a wide range of negative sequelae, including substance use [5], suicidal ideation and attempts [6], and additional mental health comorbidities [7]. Although several treatments have demonstrated efficacy for anxiety in youth, including individual cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT), family CBT (FCBT), medication (MED), and combination of CBT and medication (COMB) [8], a meaningful portion of youth are classified as non-responders after a full course of treatment [9]. The identification of baseline predictors and moderators of response is critical to improve treatment efficacy and reduce burden on families. Increased anxiety severity, comorbidity (behavioral problems, depression), and family psychopathology, along with older age, female gender and anxiety diagnosis, have been highlighted as potential predictors and moderators of outcome. However, studies have been underpowered and findings are inconsistent [10]. To date, all studies have taken a traditional analytic approach, which typically provides conservative estimates as a result of imposed explanatory constraints [11]. Machine Learning (ML) represents a promising complementary statistical technique to traditional analyses, given its focus on predictive fit rather than explanatory inference [12] and will facilitate identification of non-linear, complex patterns of predictors and moderators at the individual level [13, 14]. These methods have shown promise in identification of treatment outcome predictors in other medical [e.g., 15-18] and psychiatric samples [e.g., 19-22], but to date have not been implemented in a sample of anxious youth. The proposed project will aggregate datasets from at minimum ten peer-reviewed and published randomized controlled trials (N=1444) and train and validate two models along overlapping features, including (1) demographics, (2) diagnosis, (3) anxiety severity (4) behavioral problems, and (5) family psychopathology. Models will also be used to examine differential response to ICBT, FCBT, MED and COMB. Aggregated data will be uploaded into a centralized dataset, in line with the NIMH RDoC db and NDAR [23] datasets, and then used to predict outcome for individual anxious youth (N=80) completing ICBT and COMB at the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple. The aims of this study are consistent with calls issued in the NIMH strategic plan (Objective 3) and will help facilitate the development of person-centered interventions for anxious youth [24]. An individualized approach to treatment is important to further increase treatment efficacy and reduce the financial and emotional burden associated with non-response [25, 26]. A training plan has been designed that consists of mentorship, formal classwork and experiential learning to develop the applicant's expertise in machine learning and dataset aggregation. The proposed study will take place within Temple University's clinical psychology program, which has a successful track record of conducting impactful NIMH-funded research and training research scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although several efficacious treatments have been identified for youth anxiety, there is significant heterogeneity in treatment response and this heterogeneity is poorly understood. To help clarify differences in treatment response and facilitate the development of person-centered interventions, novel and advanced statistical approaches should be implemented using adequately powered datasets. The proposed study will (1) use machine-learning methods to identify predictors and moderators of outcome in an aggregated dataset of at minimum ten Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) examining youth anxiety treatments (individual and family cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, and combination treatments), (2) create a centralized dataset of aggregated RCTs to foster continued cross-site collaboration and (3) test the model's predictive accuracy at the individual level in a real-world sample.",Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth,9990935,F31MH123038,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology)', 'Emotional', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Youth', 'active method', 'anxiety treatment', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'childhood anxiety', 'clinical decision-making', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'demographics', 'depression model', 'design', 'expectation', 'family burden', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individual variation', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'parental role', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response', 'social anxiety', 'treatment response']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,F31,2020,33509,0.03861895701861808
"Measuring real time decision-making about UVR Protection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of interventions to maximize consistency in ultraviolet radiation (UVR) protection rests on improved understanding of decision-making factors that contribute to daily variation in UVR protection. In this study, we use Ethnographic Decision Tree Modeling to examine decision-making regarding sunscreen use, shade-seeking, and UVR protection behavior in melanoma first-degree relatives (FDRs). In Phase I, we will generate the models via qualitative ethnographic interviews with 25 melanoma FDRs, and then will construct a composite decision-making model for each of the three UVR protection outcomes. In Phase II we will establish the validity of the models using ecological momentary assessment of UVR protection (over 14 summer days, at 1 pm and 5 pm daily) in 60 FDRs. We will recruit equal numbers of women and men, and equal numbers of those who perceive high and low advantages of tanning, given the importance of these predictors for UVR protection. Specific Aim I is to generate and establish the validity of the models explaining decision-making about three UVR protection behaviors (sunscreen use, shade-seeking, use of protective clothing) in melanoma FDRs, and Specific Aim II is to examine theory-driven affective and cognitive predictors of sun protection maintenance (sunscreen use, shade-seeking, and use of sun protective clothing) assessed in real time. We adopt a theory-informed approach to decision-making, and so expect that the factors identified inductively in Phase I, as well as between- and within-subject variation in melanoma threat, efficacy beliefs, and satisfaction with UVR protection drawn from Witte's Extended Parallel Processing Model and Rothman's theory of health behavior maintenance will predict UVR protection behaviors. We will also examine gender and tanning attitudes as covariates of these effects. The study findings will increase our understanding of the decision- making context for behavioral maintenance of UVR protection, and dictate novel intervention strategies to reduce behavioral inconsistency - and increase behavioral maintenance - of UVR protection in those at high risk for melanoma. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will examine daily UVR protection and decision-making about protection in 60 first degree family members of melanoma patients who complete 14-day diaries via personal digital assistants and audio-taped narratives.

"Data-driven Computational Modeling and Refinement of Protein Structures on Genomic Scales PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: A key remaining gap in our understanding of biological systems at the molecular level is how to structurally annotate the “dark” protein families—the portion of protein families unsolved by experimental structure determination techniques and inaccessible to homology modeling. Nearly a quarter of protein families are currently dark, where molecular conformation is completely unknown and this gap is likely to expand further with the rapid accumulation of new protein sequences without annotated structures. The key challenge is now how to bridge this gap to gain a comprehensive understanding of biology and disease, thereby paving the way to structure-based drug design at genomic scale. Computational protein modeling plays a key role in this effort due to its scalability and genome-wide applicability. My laboratory focuses on the development and application of novel data-driven computational modeling and refinement methods to increase accuracy and coverage of protein structure prediction on genomic scale irrespective of homology. Future research focuses on improving homology-free protein folding using multiscale de novo modeling driven by deep learning-based inter-residue interactions, enhancing low-homology threading or fold recognition by formulating new algorithms for remote template identification despite low evolutionary relatedness, and developing methods for high-resolution restrained structure refinement guided by generalized ensemble search for driving computational models to near-experimental accuracy. Proteome-wide computational modeling and refinement effort will be conducted, leveraging our unique access to large-scale supercomputing infrastructure, to build high-confidence models covering the dark protein families, which will be organized in a database for public access. This comprehensive database of structural annotations will shed light on the structures, functions, and interactions of the dark proteome, with broad implications in drug discovery and human health. Software and web servers will be freely disseminated to help worldwide community of biomedical researchers to apply these methods to their specific research problems, thus multiplying the impact of computational modeling on basic research in biology and medicine. My research program will involve close collaborations with other NIGMS-supported investigators, create training opportunities for the next generation of researchers including members from underrepresented groups, and foster future research advances in structural bioinformatics and computational biology. PROJECT NARRATIVE: A comprehensive atomic-level annotation of protein structures is essential for understanding the molecular basis of complex diseases and facilitating structure-based drug design. Lack of structural annotation of a major fraction protein universe, the so-called dark families, is a key gap in our understanding of molecular biology and diseases.

"Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats SUMMARY: OVERALL  This proposal, Consortium for Immunotherapeutics Against Emerging Viral Diseases, addresses a critical gap in the biodefense portfolio by building an academic-industry partnership to advance effective, fully human, antibody-based immunotherapeutics against three major families of emerging/re-emerging viruses: Lassa virus, Ebola and other Filoviruses, and mosquito-transmitted Alphaviruses that threaten millions worldwide. This program follows directly from our significant body of preliminary data (the largest available for these families of viruses), therapeutics in hand, multidisciplinary expertise, and demonstrated collaborative success. Included in the proposed CETR portfolio are: (1) the only available immunotherapeutics against endemic Lassa virus, with reversal of late-stage disease and complete survival in infected non-human primates, (2) novel Ebola and pan- ebolavirus therapeutics that also completely protect non-human primates from disease, and that were built by the paradigm-shifting and comprehensive analysis of a global consortium, and (3) much needed, first-in-class therapeutics against the re-emerging alphaviruses that have tremendous epidemic potential in the United States and around the globe. These multidisciplinary studies, founded upon pioneering structural biology of the antigen targets, include innovations such as agnostic, high-throughput Fc profiling and optimization, coupled with Fv evolution to enhance potency and developability, as well as a sophisticated statistical and computational analysis core to evaluate thresholds and correlates of protection across the major families of pathogens. Together, we aim to understand what findings represent general rules and what data are specific to each virus family. We also aim to provide streamlined systems for antibody choice and optimization that do not yet exist, and to build a broadly applicable platform for mAb discovery and delivery against any novel pathogen as they emerge.

"T4SS effectors and tick tropism in Anaplasma phagocytolium Project Summary  Tick-borne diseases are on the increase, and are responsible for nearly all of the vector-transmitted disease in the US. Vector-borne pathogens face the dual challenge of adaptation to two very different host environments: the arthropod vector and the mammalian host. To survive within eukaryotic cells, the rickettsial pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum blocks phago-lysosome maturation, inhibits apoptosis, modulates host gene expression, redirects trans-Golgi trafficking, and repurposes autophagic machinery to build a replication vacuole. A. phagocytophilum must accomplish this, all while evading the unique innate immune defenses of mammalian and arthropod host cells. All pathogens in the order Rickettsiales utilize a specialized Type IV Secretion System (T4SS) to deliver effector molecules into the host cell cytosol to mediate host pathogen interactions. However, identification of the secreted effectors has been limited by the obligate nature of these pathogens. Even less is known about how effectors contribute to rickettsial growth in tick cells, as the tick vector remains an understudied niche of these pathogens. To overcome this, our group has developed a T4SS effector prediction program Optimal-features Predictor for T4SS Effectors (OPT4e). When applied to A. phagocytophilum, OPT4e identified 48 putative T4SS effectors. Transcriptomics finds that 15 of these predicted effector genes are specifically expressed during growth within either tick or mammalian cells. We have demonstrated that one of these tick- specific effector candidates, Aph1383, is translocated in a T4 specific manner by the Legionella pneumophila T4SS. Aph1383 also belongs to a paralogous family of six proteins encoded by the gene cluster aph1380-1386. This entire cluster is expressed 2.5-fold more highly during A. phagocytophilum growth in tick cells than during mammalian cell infections. We hypothesize that this family of Aph1383 paralogs are all T4SS effectors which target host cell processes specifically important for A. phagocytophilum growth within tick cells. In this study, we will first use transposon insertion mutants in the aph1380-1386 gene cluster to test the fitness contribution of these genes during A. phagocytophilum growth within tick cells. Next, we will evaluate the T4SS translocation of all Aph1383 paralogs and identify the amino acid sequences necessary for secretion. Finally, we will identify the subcellular localization and molecular targets of Aph1383 within tick cells. Characterizing these molecular interactions of A. phagocytophilum within the tick cell will open the door to development of vector targeted interventions to reduce transmissibility of the pathogen. Project Narrative Vector-borne diseases account for >17% of the global burden of all infectious diseases. The ability of the tick-borne rickettsial pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum to manipulate the cell biology of both mammalian and tick cells is achieved through delivery of effector molecules by a specialized secretion system. This project investigates how a family of tick specific effectors enables A. phagocytophilum to survive and replicate within tick cells.",T4SS effectors and tick tropism in Anaplasma phagocytolium,10041492,R21AI154023,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anaplasma', 'Anaplasma phagocytophilum', 'Apoptosis', 'Arthropod Vectors', 'Arthropods', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Case Study', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Cytosol', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Ectopic Expression', 'Environment', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Face', 'Family', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Growth', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Legionella pneumophila', 'Libraries', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Style', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Midgut', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutagenesis', 'Nature', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Phagolysosome', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Reporter', 'Rickettsia', 'Salivary Glands', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tick-Borne Diseases', 'Ticks', 'Transfection', 'Tropism', 'Type IV Secretion System Pathway', 'United States', 'Vacuole', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'cell type', 'feeding', 'fitness test', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mutant', 'neutrophil', 'paralogous gene', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'programs', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tick-borne', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transcriptomics', 'transmission process', 'vector', 'vector tick', 'vector-borne pathogen']",NIAID,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,191250,-0.020373769384507464
"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome The main goal of the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program is to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire human proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG (“IDG List”). The long-term objective of the KMC is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins. With focus on the IDG List and human proteins, the KMC will enable support for expanded coverage for non-human proteins of therapeutic interest and other associated human health data, in order to catalyze novel biomedical discoveries. To support the overall IDG objective, and to maintain, update and improve these integrated resources, the KMC draws upon expertise from multiple knowledge domains, specifically biology, chemistry and medicine, as well as computer science, graphic design and web programming. Specifically, for the Phase 2 of the IDG KMC we propose 4 Aims:1. Create an automated workflow that captures relevant public data for the entire proteome and manual annotations for the IDG list. The KMC knowledge management system will be built around knowledge graphs, focused on five major branches of the target knowledge tree, tkt: Genotype, Phenotype, Expression, Structure & Function, and Interactions & Pathways, respectively. Aim 2: Design, develop and implement a protein knowledgebase with Data Analytics support. Our protein-centric biomedical knowledge base, TCKB (Target Central Knowledgebase) will be comprised of the data, knowledge and information container, together with its codebase and software pipelines. TCKB will be the repository for experimental, processed and computed data and reagents originating from the IDG DRGCs (Data and Resource Generation Centers). We will provide informatics and modeling support for DRGC activities. Aim 3: We will expand, improve and maintain Pharos. Particularly “knowledge packages,” support automated data summaries for Protein Dossiers, and actively seek feedback from our community. Aim 4. Outreach to scientific community. We will support a series of activities that will leverage TCKB, Pharos and other IDG resources to increase adoption of IDG work, while observing FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for our knowledgebase, portal and pipelines. The KMC will engage in community outreach by leading tutorials and feedback sessions and dissemination of the Pharos system. To meet its goals, the KMC will coordinate all core activities in close coordination with the IDG Steering Committee and IDG Project Scientists (PS), and include members of the IDG Consortium (IDG- C), other NIH Common Fund programs, NIH Commons, as well as other initiatives.

The KMC knowledge management system will be built around knowledge graphs, focused on five major branches of the target knowledge tree, tkt: Genotype, Phenotype, Expression, Structure & Function, and Interactions & Pathways, respectively. Aim 2: Design, develop and implement a protein knowledgebase with Data Analytics support. Our protein-centric biomedical knowledge base, TCKB (Target Central Knowledgebase) will be comprised of the data, knowledge and information container, together with its codebase and software pipelines. TCKB will be the repository for experimental, processed and computed data and reagents originating from the IDG DRGCs (Data and Resource Generation Centers). We will provide informatics and modeling support for DRGC activities. Aim 3: We will expand, improve and maintain Pharos. Particularly “knowledge packages,” support automated data summaries for Protein Dossiers, and actively seek feedback from our community. Aim 4. Outreach to scientific community. We will support a series of activities that will leverage TCKB, Pharos and other IDG resources to increase adoption of IDG work, while observing FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for our knowledgebase, portal and pipelines. The KMC will engage in community outreach by leading tutorials and feedback sessions and dissemination of the Pharos system. To meet its goals, the KMC will coordinate all core activities in close coordination with the IDG Steering Committee and IDG Project Scientists (PS), and include members of the IDG Consortium (IDG- C), other NIH Common Fund programs, NIH Commons, as well as other initiatives.

"The AYA-RISE Intervention: Risk Information and Screening Education for Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer Predisposition Syndromes ABSTRACT Growing evidence shows that hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes affect 5-10% of cancer patients, with heightened risk among patients who develop cancer at a young age, especially adolescents and young adults (AYAs). Genetic counseling is therefore recommended for all AYAs with new cancer diagnoses, for whom results can lead to future cancer screening, risk-reducing surgeries, and reproductive counseling. Testing can also have a domino effect, identifying other affected relatives and reducing cancer risk in entire families. AYAs require unique considerations when communicating cancer risk due to wide variability in developmental and emotional maturity. Genetic counseling necessitates complex cognitive and affective processing from AYAs, ideally resulting in an active ownership of their condition and a commitment to life-long health behavior change. This tall order comes as AYAs are forming their identity, gaining parental independence, and considering future childbearing – often under the shadow of enormous personal or family losses from cancer. These factors complicate AYAs' ability to weigh tradeoffs of genetic testing and screening recommendations – sometimes with tragic consequences. Unfortunately, there have been few if any efforts to optimize cancer risk communication and decision-making for AYAs. The goal of this project is to develop, implement and test an AYA-specific intervention for cancer risk communication and decision-making. Our interdisciplinary team of experts in health communication, cancer genetics, oncology, and pediatric psychology from 4 major Cancer Risk Programs will develop AYA-RISE (Risk Information and Screening Education), a web-based intervention comprised of (1) an interactive chatbot designed to communicate genetic information to AYAs in developmentally appropriate ways; and (2) an individualized patient portal, serving as an educational resource and longitudinal repository for cancer risk and screening information. Iterative user testing with qualitative feedback from AYAs will be used to optimize the program prior to conducting a type I hybrid implementation effectiveness trial of AYA-RISE. Our aims are: Aim 1: To refine and pilot AYA-RISE, adapting implementation to ensure feasibility and acceptability among AYAs with cancer risk syndromes, their family members, and providers. Aim 2: To test AYA-RISE among AYAs with cancer predisposition syndromes at 4 centers to determine impact on (1) patient knowledge of cancer risk and recommended screening; (2) psychological distress; (3) patient ownership of information; and (4) follow-up for recommended care. Aim 3: To evaluate implementation outcomes of AYA-RISE, including ways that AYAs use the chatbot and patient portal, and AYA, family, and provider experiences, to facilitate future dissemination. If successful, this study will yield a scalable, patient- and family-centered intervention to improve cancer risk communication and decision-making for AYAs and their families, with an ultimate goal of cancer risk reduction. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes affect 5-10% of patients with incident cancers, with heightened risk among patients who develop cancer at a young age, especially adolescents and young adults (AYAs). As a result, genetic counseling and testing is increasingly recommended for AYAs with new cancer diagnoses so that screening for new cancers can take place; however, no AYA-specific models for cancer risk communication and decision-making have been developed. The proposed study will develop and test a novel, patient- and family-centered model for cancer risk communication and decision-making to meet the unique needs of AYAs.",The AYA-RISE Intervention: Risk Information and Screening Education for Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer Predisposition Syndromes,9848695,U01CA243688,"['Access to Information', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'American', 'Attention', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Psychology', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Counseling', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthcare', 'Hereditary Malignant Neoplasm', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Parents', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Savings', 'Schedule', 'Screening for cancer', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer risk', 'chatbot', 'child bearing', 'computer program', 'design', 'education resources', 'effectiveness trial', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic counselor', 'genetic information', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'oncology', 'patient portal', 'programs', 'psychological distress', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'reproductive', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'screening guidelines']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,U01,2019,3543148,0.07550107161668208
